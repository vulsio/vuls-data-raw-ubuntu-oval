		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domainThe qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. Whilefor nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pagesto the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potentialmemleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in boththe __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().
