		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior As runtime PM is enabled, themodule can be runtime suspended when .remove() is called. Do apm_runtime_get_sync() to make sure module is active before doing anyregister operations. Doing a pm_runtime_put_sync() should disable therefclk so no need to disable it again. Fixes the below warning at moduleremovel. [ 39.705310] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 39.710004]clk:162:3 already disabled [ 39.713941] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 921 atdrivers/clk/clk.c:1090 clk_core_disable+0xb0/0xb8 We calledof_platform_populate() in .probe() so call the cleanup functionof_platform_depopulate() in .remove().
