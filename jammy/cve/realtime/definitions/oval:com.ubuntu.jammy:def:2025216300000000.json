Hence the firstsubmission can end up using it uninitialized, if the recv wasn'tsuccessful and the networking stack didn't honor ->msg_get_inq being setand filling in the output value of ->msg_inq as requested.Set it to 0 upfront when it's allocated, just to silence this KMSANwarning. There's no side effect of using it uninitialized, it'll justpotentially cause the next receive to use a recv value hint that's notaccurate.",
