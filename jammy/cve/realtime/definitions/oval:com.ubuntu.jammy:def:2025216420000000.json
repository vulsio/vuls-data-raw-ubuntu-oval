		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mptcp: sysctl: sched: avoid using current->nsproxyUsing the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for differentreasons.First, if the goal is to use it to read or write per-netns data, this isinconsistent with how the \"generic\" sysctl entries are doing: directlyby only using pointers set to the table entry, e.g. table->data. Linkedto that, the per-netns data should always be obtained from the tablelinked to the netns it had been created for, which may not coincide withthe reader's or writer's netns.Another reason is that access to current->nsproxy->netns can oops ifattempted when current->nsproxy had been dropped when the current taskis exiting. This is what syzbot found, when using acct(2):  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address0xdffffc0000000005: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000028-0x000000000000002f]  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 5924 Comm: syz-executor Not tainted6.13.0-rc5-syzkaller-00004-gccb98ccef0e5 #0  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 09/13/2024  RIP: 0010:proc_scheduler+0xc6/0x3c0 net/mptcp/ctrl.c:125  Code: 03 42 80 3c 38 00 0f 85 fe 02 00 00 4d 8b a4 24 08 09 00 00 48 b800 00 00 00 00 fc ff df 49 8d 7c 24 28 48 89 fa 48 c1 ea 03 <80> 3c 02 000f 85 cc 02 00 00 4d 8b 7c 24 28 48 8d 84 24 c8 00 00  RSP: 0018:ffffc900034774e8 EFLAGS: 00010206  RAX: dffffc0000000000 RBX: 1ffff9200068ee9e RCX: ffffc90003477620  RDX: 0000000000000005 RSI: ffffffff8b08f91e RDI: 0000000000000028  RBP: 0000000000000001 R08: ffffc90003477710 R09: 0000000000000040  R10: 0000000000000040 R11: 00000000726f7475 R12: 0000000000000000  R13: ffffc90003477620 R14: ffffc90003477710 R15: dffffc0000000000  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b8700000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 00007fee3cd452d8 CR3: 000000007d116000 CR4: 00000000003526f0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   <TASK>   proc_sys_call_handler+0x403/0x5d0 fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:601   __kernel_write_iter+0x318/0xa80 fs/read_write.c:612   __kernel_write+0xf6/0x140 fs/read_write.c:632   do_acct_process+0xcb0/0x14a0 kernel/acct.c:539   acct_pin_kill+0x2d/0x100 kernel/acct.c:192   pin_kill+0x194/0x7c0 fs/fs_pin.c:44   mnt_pin_kill+0x61/0x1e0 fs/fs_pin.c:81   cleanup_mnt+0x3ac/0x450 fs/namespace.c:1366   task_work_run+0x14e/0x250 kernel/task_work.c:239   exit_task_work include/linux/task_work.h:43 [inline]   do_exit+0xad8/0x2d70 kernel/exit.c:938   do_group_exit+0xd3/0x2a0 kernel/exit.c:1087   get_signal+0x2576/0x2610 kernel/signal.c:3017   arch_do_signal_or_restart+0x90/0x7e0 arch/x86/kernel/signal.c:337   exit_to_user_mode_loop kernel/entry/common.c:111 [inline]   exit_to_user_mode_prepare include/linux/entry-common.h:329 [inline]   __syscall_exit_to_user_mode_work kernel/entry/common.c:207 [inline]   syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x150/0x2a0 kernel/entry/common.c:218   do_syscall_64+0xda/0x250 arch/x86/entry/common.c:89   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f  RIP: 0033:0x7fee3cb87a6a  Code: Unable to access opcode bytes at 0x7fee3cb87a40.
