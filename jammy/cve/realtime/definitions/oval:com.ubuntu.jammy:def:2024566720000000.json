		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:blk-cgroup: Fix UAF in blkcg_unpin_online()blkcg_unpin_online() walks up the blkcg hierarchy putting the online pin.Towalk up, it uses blkcg_parent(blkcg) but it was calling that afterblkcg_destroy_blkgs(blkcg) which could free the blkcg, leading to thefollowing UAF:  ==================================================================  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in blkcg_unpin_online+0x15a/0x270  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8881057678c0 by task kworker/9:1/117  CPU: 9 UID: 0 PID: 117 Comm: kworker/9:1 Not tainted6.13.0-rc1-work-00182-gb8f52214c61a-dirty #48  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS unknown02/02/2022  Workqueue: cgwb_release cgwb_release_workfn  Call Trace:   <TASK>   dump_stack_lvl+0x27/0x80   print_report+0x151/0x710   kasan_report+0xc0/0x100   blkcg_unpin_online+0x15a/0x270   cgwb_release_workfn+0x194/0x480   process_scheduled_works+0x71b/0xe20   worker_thread+0x82a/0xbd0   kthread+0x242/0x2c0   ret_from_fork+0x33/0x70   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30   </TASK>  ...
