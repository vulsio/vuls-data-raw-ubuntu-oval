		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB dataIn case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocolpayload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI addresswidth is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged datais bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXIaddress width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at leasttwo DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffermapped from one piece of non-paged data:    dma_desc[N + 0],    dma_desc[N + 1],    dma_desc[N + 2].Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to holdextra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA bufferaddress returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try tounmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].bufis a valid buffer address.The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-pageddata to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by theDMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer addressobviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish thepending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will gohorribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memoryregion, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will betriggered :(In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectlyas expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-pageddata and paged frags actually.This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array indexfor tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.Tested and verified on DWXGMAC CORE 3.20a",
