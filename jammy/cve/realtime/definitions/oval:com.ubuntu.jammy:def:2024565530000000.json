		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: fix memleak of proc->delivered_freezeIf a freeze notification is cleared with BC_CLEAR_FREEZE_NOTIFICATIONbefore calling binder_freeze_notification_done(), then it is detachedfrom its reference (e.g. ref->freeze) but the work remains queued inproc->delivered_freeze. This leads to a memory leak when the processexits as any pending entries in proc->delivered_freeze are not freed:  unreferenced object 0xffff38e8cfa36180 (size 64):    comm \"binder-util\", pid 655, jiffies 4294936641    hex dump (first 32 bytes):      b8 e9 9e c8 e8 38 ff ff b8 e9 9e c8 e8 38 ff ff  .....8.......8..      0b 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3c 1f 4b 00 00 00 00 00  ........<.K.....    backtrace (crc 95983b32):      [<000000000d0582cf>] kmemleak_alloc+0x34/0x40      [<000000009c99a513>] __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x208/0x280      [<00000000313b1704>] binder_thread_write+0xdec/0x439c      [<000000000cbd33bb>] binder_ioctl+0x1b68/0x22cc      [<000000002bbedeeb>] __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x124/0x190      [<00000000b439adee>] invoke_syscall+0x6c/0x254      [<00000000173558fc>] el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xac/0x230      [<0000000084f72311>] do_el0_svc+0x40/0x58      [<000000008b872457>] el0_svc+0x38/0x78      [<00000000ee778653>] el0t_64_sync_handler+0x120/0x12c      [<00000000a8ec61bf>] el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194This patch fixes the leak by ensuring that any pending entries inproc->delivered_freeze are freed during binder_deferred_release().",
