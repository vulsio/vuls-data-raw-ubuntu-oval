		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:smb: client: fix NULL ptr deref in crypto_aead_setkey()Neither SMB3.0 or SMB3.02 supports encryption negotiate context, sowhen SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION flag is set in the negotiate response,the client uses AES-128-CCM as the default cipher.  See MS-SMB23.3.5.4.Commit b0abcd65ec54 (\"smb: client: fix UAF in async decryption\") addeda @server->cipher_type check to conditionally callsmb3_crypto_aead_allocate(), but that check would always be false as@server->cipher_type is unset for SMB3.02.Fix the following KASAN splat by setting @server->cipher_type forSMB3.02 as well.mount.cifs //srv/share /mnt -o vers=3.02,seal,...BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in crypto_aead_setkey+0x2c/0x130Read of size 8 at addr 0000000000000020 by task mount.cifs/1095CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 1095 Comm: mount.cifs Not tainted 6.12.0 #1Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-3.fc4104/01/2014Call Trace: <TASK> dump_stack_lvl+0x5d/0x80 ? crypto_aead_setkey+0x2c/0x130 kasan_report+0xda/0x110 ? crypto_aead_setkey+0x2c/0x130 crypto_aead_setkey+0x2c/0x130 crypt_message+0x258/0xec0 [cifs] ? __asan_memset+0x23/0x50 ? __pfx_crypt_message+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? mark_lock+0xb0/0x6a0 ? hlock_class+0x32/0xb0 ? mark_lock+0xb0/0x6a0 smb3_init_transform_rq+0x352/0x3f0 [cifs] ? lock_acquire.part.0+0xf4/0x2a0 smb_send_rqst+0x144/0x230 [cifs] ? __pfx_smb_send_rqst+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? hlock_class+0x32/0xb0 ? smb2_setup_request+0x225/0x3a0 [cifs] ? __pfx_cifs_compound_last_callback+0x10/0x10 [cifs] compound_send_recv+0x59b/0x1140 [cifs] ? __pfx_compound_send_recv+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? __create_object+0x5e/0x90 ? hlock_class+0x32/0xb0 ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x9a/0xf0 cifs_send_recv+0x23/0x30 [cifs] SMB2_tcon+0x3ec/0xb30 [cifs] ? __pfx_SMB2_tcon+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? lock_acquire.part.0+0xf4/0x2a0 ? __pfx_lock_release+0x10/0x10 ? do_raw_spin_trylock+0xc6/0x120 ? lock_acquire+0x3f/0x90 ? _get_xid+0x16/0xd0 [cifs] ? __pfx_SMB2_tcon+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? cifs_get_smb_ses+0xcdd/0x10a0 [cifs] cifs_get_smb_ses+0xcdd/0x10a0 [cifs] ? __pfx_cifs_get_smb_ses+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? cifs_get_tcp_session+0xaa0/0xca0 [cifs] cifs_mount_get_session+0x8a/0x210 [cifs] dfs_mount_share+0x1b0/0x11d0 [cifs] ? __pfx___lock_acquire+0x10/0x10 ? __pfx_dfs_mount_share+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? lock_acquire.part.0+0xf4/0x2a0 ? find_held_lock+0x8a/0xa0 ? hlock_class+0x32/0xb0 ? lock_release+0x203/0x5d0 cifs_mount+0xb3/0x3d0 [cifs] ? do_raw_spin_trylock+0xc6/0x120 ? __pfx_cifs_mount+0x10/0x10 [cifs] ? lock_acquire+0x3f/0x90 ? find_nls+0x16/0xa0 ? smb3_update_mnt_flags+0x372/0x3b0 [cifs] cifs_smb3_do_mount+0x1e2/0xc80 [cifs] ? __pfx_vfs_parse_fs_string+0x10/0x10 ? __pfx_cifs_smb3_do_mount+0x10/0x10 [cifs] smb3_get_tree+0x1bf/0x330 [cifs] vfs_get_tree+0x4a/0x160 path_mount+0x3c1/0xfb0 ? kasan_quarantine_put+0xc7/0x1d0 ? __pfx_path_mount+0x10/0x10 ? kmem_cache_free+0x118/0x3e0 ? user_path_at+0x74/0xa0 __x64_sys_mount+0x1a6/0x1e0 ? __pfx___x64_sys_mount+0x10/0x10 ? mark_held_locks+0x1a/0x90 do_syscall_64+0xbb/0x1d0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53185` to fix the vulnerability.
