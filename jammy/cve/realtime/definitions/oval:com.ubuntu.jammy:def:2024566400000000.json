		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/smc: fix LGR and link use-after-free issueWe encountered a LGR/link use-after-free issue, which manifested asthe LGR/link refcnt reaching 0 early and entering the clear process,making resource access unsafe. refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free. WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 107447 at lib/refcount.c:25refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0x140 Workqueue: events smc_lgr_terminate_work [smc] Call trace:  refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0x140  __smc_lgr_terminate.part.45+0x2a8/0x370 [smc]  smc_lgr_terminate_work+0x28/0x30 [smc]  process_one_work+0x1b8/0x420  worker_thread+0x158/0x510  kthread+0x114/0x118or refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

One suspect is thatsmc_conn_free() is called repeatedly because some smc_conn_free() fromserver listening path are not protected by sock lock.e.g.Calls under socklock        | smc_listen_work-------------------------------------------------------lock_sock(sk)               | smc_conn_abortsmc_conn_free               | \\- smc_conn_free\\- smcr_link_put            |    \\- smcr_link_put (duplicated)release_sock(sk)So here add sock lock protection in smc_listen_work() path, making itexclusive with other connection operations.",
