		"title": "CVE-2024-56581 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: ref-verify: fix use-after-free after invalid ref actionAt btrfs_ref_tree_mod() after we successfully inserted the new ref entry(local variable 'ref') into the respective block entry's rbtree (localvariable 'be'), if we find an unexpected action of BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF,we error out and free the ref entry without removing it from the blockentry's rbtree. Then in the error path of btrfs_ref_tree_mod() we callbtrfs_free_ref_cache(), which iterates over all block entries and thencalls free_block_entry() for each one, and there we will trigger ause-after-free when we are called against the block entry to which weadded the freed ref entry to its rbtree, since the rbtree still pointsto the block entry, as we didn't remove it from the rbtree before freeingit in the error path at btrfs_ref_tree_mod(). Fix this by removing thenew ref entry from the rbtree before freeing it.Syzbot report this with the following stack traces:   BTRFS error (device loop0 state EA):   Ref action 2, root 5, ref_root 0,parent 8564736, owner 0, offset 0, num_refs 18446744073709551615      __btrfs_mod_ref+0x7dd/0xac0 fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:2523      update_ref_for_cow+0x9cd/0x11f0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:512      btrfs_force_cow_block+0x9f6/0x1da0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:594      btrfs_cow_block+0x35e/0xa40 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:754      btrfs_search_slot+0xbdd/0x30d0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:2116      btrfs_insert_empty_items+0x9c/0x1a0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:4314      btrfs_insert_empty_item fs/btrfs/ctree.h:669 [inline]      btrfs_insert_orphan_item+0x1f1/0x320 fs/btrfs/orphan.c:23      btrfs_orphan_add+0x6d/0x1a0 fs/btrfs/inode.c:3482      btrfs_unlink+0x267/0x350 fs/btrfs/inode.c:4293      vfs_unlink+0x365/0x650 fs/namei.c:4469      do_unlinkat+0x4ae/0x830 fs/namei.c:4533      __do_sys_unlinkat fs/namei.c:4576 [inline]      __se_sys_unlinkat fs/namei.c:4569 [inline]      __x64_sys_unlinkat+0xcc/0xf0 fs/namei.c:4569      do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]      do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x230 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f   BTRFS error (device loop0 state EA):   Ref action 1, root 5, ref_root 5,parent 0, owner 260, offset 0, num_refs 1      __btrfs_mod_ref+0x76b/0xac0 fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:2521      update_ref_for_cow+0x96a/0x11f0      btrfs_force_cow_block+0x9f6/0x1da0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:594      btrfs_cow_block+0x35e/0xa40 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:754      btrfs_search_slot+0xbdd/0x30d0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:2116      btrfs_lookup_inode+0xdc/0x480 fs/btrfs/inode-item.c:411      __btrfs_update_delayed_inode+0x1e7/0xb90fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c:1030      btrfs_update_delayed_inode fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c:1114 [inline]      __btrfs_commit_inode_delayed_items+0x2318/0x24a0fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c:1137      __btrfs_run_delayed_items+0x213/0x490 fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c:1171      btrfs_commit_transaction+0x8a8/0x3740 fs/btrfs/transaction.c:2313      prepare_to_relocate+0x3c4/0x4c0 fs/btrfs/relocation.c:3586      relocate_block_group+0x16c/0xd40 fs/btrfs/relocation.c:3611      btrfs_relocate_block_group+0x77d/0xd90 fs/btrfs/relocation.c:4081      btrfs_relocate_chunk+0x12c/0x3b0 fs/btrfs/volumes.c:3377      __btrfs_balance+0x1b0f/0x26b0 fs/btrfs/volumes.c:4161      btrfs_balance+0xbdc/0x10c0 fs/btrfs/volumes.c:4538   BTRFS error (device loop0 state EA):   Ref action 2, root 5, ref_root 0,parent 8564736, owner 0, offset 0, num_refs 18446744073709551615      __btrfs_mod_ref+0x7dd/0xac0 fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:2523      update_ref_for_cow+0x9cd/0x11f0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:512      btrfs_force_cow_block+0x9f6/0x1da0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:594      btrfs_cow_block+0x35e/0xa40 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:754      btrfs_search_slot+0xbdd/0x30d0 fs/btrfs/ctree.c:2116      btrfs_lookup_inode+0xdc/0x480 fs/btrfs/inode-item.c:411      __btrfs_update_delayed_inode+0x1e7/0xb90fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c:1030      btrfs_update_delayed_i---truncated---",
