For guests with protected state,e.g. SEV-ES and SEV-SNP, KVM must assume the hypercall was made in 64-bitmode as the vCPU state needed to detect 64-bit mode is unavailable.Hacking the sev_smoke_test selftest to generate a KVM_HC_MAP_GPA_RANGEhypercall via VMGEXIT trips the WARN:  ------------[ cut here ]------------  WARNING: CPU: 273 PID: 326626 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.h:180complete_hypercall_exit+0x44/0xe0 [kvm]  Modules linked in: kvm_amd kvm ...
