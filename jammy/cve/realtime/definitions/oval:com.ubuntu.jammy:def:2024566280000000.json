And it should bethe same with invalid pmd entry, since pmd_none() is called by functionfree_pgd_range() and pmd_none() return 0 by huge_pte_clear(). So single_PAGE_HUGE bit is also treated as a valid pte table and free_pte_range()will be called in free_pmd_range().  free_pmd_range()        pmd = pmd_offset(pud, addr);        do {                next = pmd_addr_end(addr, end);                if (pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd))                        continue;                free_pte_range(tlb, pmd, addr);        } while (pmd++, addr = next, addr != end);Here invalid_pte_table is used for both invalid huge pte entry andpmd entry.",
