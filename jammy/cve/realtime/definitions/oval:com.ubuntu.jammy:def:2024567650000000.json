		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/pseries/vas: Add close() callback in vas_vm_ops structThe mapping VMA address is saved in VAS window struct when thepaste address is mapped. This VMA address is used during migrationto unmap the paste address if the window is active. The pasteaddress mapping will be removed when the window is closed or withthe munmap(). But the VMA address in the VAS window is not updatedwith munmap() which is causing invalid access during migration.The KASAN report shows:[16386.254991] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free inreconfig_close_windows+0x1a0/0x4e8[16386.255043] Read of size 8 at addr c00000014a819670 by task drmgr/696928[16386.255096] CPU: 29 UID: 0 PID: 696928 Comm: drmgr Kdump: loadedTainted: G    B              6.11.0-rc5-nxgzip #2[16386.255128] Tainted: [B]=BAD_PAGE[16386.255148] Hardware name: IBM,9080-HEX Power11 (architected) 0x8202000xf000007 of:IBM,FW1110.00 (NH1110_016) hv:phyp pSeries[16386.255181] Call Trace:[16386.255202] [c00000016b297660] [c0000000018ad0ac]dump_stack_lvl+0x84/0xe8 (unreliable)[16386.255246] [c00000016b297690] [c0000000006e8a90]print_report+0x19c/0x764[16386.255285] [c00000016b297760] [c0000000006e9490]kasan_report+0x128/0x1f8[16386.255309] [c00000016b297880] [c0000000006eb5c8] __asan_load8+0xac/0xe0[16386.255326] [c00000016b2978a0] [c00000000013f898]reconfig_close_windows+0x1a0/0x4e8[16386.255343] [c00000016b297990] [c000000000140e58]vas_migration_handler+0x3a4/0x3fc[16386.255368] [c00000016b297a90] [c000000000128848]pseries_migrate_partition+0x4c/0x4c4...[16386.256136] Allocated by task 696554 on cpu 31 at 16377.277618s:[16386.256149]  kasan_save_stack+0x34/0x68[16386.256163]  kasan_save_track+0x34/0x80[16386.256175]  kasan_save_alloc_info+0x58/0x74[16386.256196]  __kasan_slab_alloc+0xb8/0xdc[16386.256209]  kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x200/0x3d0[16386.256225]  vm_area_alloc+0x44/0x150[16386.256245]  mmap_region+0x214/0x10c4[16386.256265]  do_mmap+0x5fc/0x750[16386.256277]  vm_mmap_pgoff+0x14c/0x24c[16386.256292]  ksys_mmap_pgoff+0x20c/0x348[16386.256303]  sys_mmap+0xd0/0x160...[16386.256350] Freed by task 0 on cpu 31 at 16386.204848s:[16386.256363]  kasan_save_stack+0x34/0x68[16386.256374]  kasan_save_track+0x34/0x80[16386.256384]  kasan_save_free_info+0x64/0x10c[16386.256396]  __kasan_slab_free+0x120/0x204[16386.256415]  kmem_cache_free+0x128/0x450[16386.256428]  vm_area_free_rcu_cb+0xa8/0xd8[16386.256441]  rcu_do_batch+0x2c8/0xcf0[16386.256458]  rcu_core+0x378/0x3c4[16386.256473]  handle_softirqs+0x20c/0x60c[16386.256495]  do_softirq_own_stack+0x6c/0x88[16386.256509]  do_softirq_own_stack+0x58/0x88[16386.256521]  __irq_exit_rcu+0x1a4/0x20c[16386.256533]  irq_exit+0x20/0x38[16386.256544]  interrupt_async_exit_prepare.constprop.0+0x18/0x2c...[16386.256717] Last potentially related work creation:[16386.256729]  kasan_save_stack+0x34/0x68[16386.256741]  __kasan_record_aux_stack+0xcc/0x12c[16386.256753]  __call_rcu_common.constprop.0+0x94/0xd04[16386.256766]  vm_area_free+0x28/0x3c[16386.256778]  remove_vma+0xf4/0x114[16386.256797]  do_vmi_align_munmap.constprop.0+0x684/0x870[16386.256811]  __vm_munmap+0xe0/0x1f8[16386.256821]  sys_munmap+0x54/0x6c[16386.256830]  system_call_exception+0x1a0/0x4a0[16386.256841]  system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec[16386.256868] The buggy address belongs to the object at c00000014a819670                which belongs to the cache vm_area_struct of size 168[16386.256887] The buggy address is located 0 bytes inside of                freed 168-byte region [c00000014a819670, c00000014a819718)[16386.256915] The buggy address belongs to the physical page:[16386.256928] page: refcount:1 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000index:0x0 pfn:0x14a81[16386.256950] memcg:c0000000ba430001[16386.256961] anon flags:0x43ffff800000000(node=4|zone=0|lastcpupid=0x7ffff)[16386.256975] page_type: 0xfdffffff(slab)[16386---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-56765` to fix the vulnerability.
