		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:afs: Fix lock recursionafs_wake_up_async_call() can incur lock recursion.  The problem is that itis called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the ->notify_lock, but it tries totake a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - butif the afs_call is already queued, we then have an extraneous ref that mustbe put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC throughrxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call(), however, which might try taking the->notify_lock again.This case isn't very common, however, so defer it to a workqueue.  The oopslooks something like:  BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, krxrpcio/7001/1646   lock: 0xffff888141399b30, .magic: dead4ead, .owner: krxrpcio/7001/1646,.owner_cpu: 0  CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1646 Comm: krxrpcio/7001 Not tainted6.12.0-rc2-build3+ #4351  Hardware name: ASUS All Series/H97-PLUS, BIOS 2306 10/09/2014  Call Trace:   <TASK>   dump_stack_lvl+0x47/0x70   do_raw_spin_lock+0x3c/0x90   rxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call+0x83/0xb0   afs_put_call+0xd7/0x180   rxrpc_notify_socket+0xa0/0x190   rxrpc_input_split_jumbo+0x198/0x1d0   rxrpc_input_data+0x14b/0x1e0   ? rxrpc_input_call_packet+0xc2/0x1f0   rxrpc_input_call_event+0xad/0x6b0   rxrpc_input_packet_on_conn+0x1e1/0x210   rxrpc_input_packet+0x3f2/0x4d0   rxrpc_io_thread+0x243/0x410   ? __pfx_rxrpc_io_thread+0x10/0x10   kthread+0xcf/0xe0   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10   ret_from_fork+0x24/0x40   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30   </TASK>",
