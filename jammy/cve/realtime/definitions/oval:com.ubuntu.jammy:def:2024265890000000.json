		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS,check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off for validation. However,variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited for this ptr kind. So thevariable offset is not checked.
