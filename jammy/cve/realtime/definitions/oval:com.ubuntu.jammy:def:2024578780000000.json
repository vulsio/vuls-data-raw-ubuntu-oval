		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_FPMRCurrently fpmr_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'fpmr' variable,and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave thisuninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back totarget->thread.uw.fpmr, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory fromthe kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regsetfrom userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existingcontents of FPMR will be retained.Before this patch:| # ./fpmr-test| Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d| SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) wrote 8 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr| GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d|| Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR (zero length)| SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=0) wrote 0 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr| GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0xffff800083963d50After this patch:| # ./fpmr-test| Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d| SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) wrote 8 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr| GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d|| Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR (zero length)| SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=0) wrote 0 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr| GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d",
