		"title": "CVE-2023-4206 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-updates 22.04 LTS (jammy) - high",
		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_routecomponent can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Whenroute4_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_resultstruct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes aproblem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() isalways called on the old instance in the success path, decreasingfilter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted,leading to a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commitb80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4206` to fix the vulnerability.
