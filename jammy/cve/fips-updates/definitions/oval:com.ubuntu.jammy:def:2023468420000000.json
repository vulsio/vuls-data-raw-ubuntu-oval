		"description": "Unlike 32-bit PV guests, HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit andother modes. This in particular means that they may set registers used topass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range 32-bitcode would be able to set them to. When processing of hypercalls takes aconsiderable amount of time, the hypervisor may choose to invoke ahypercall continuation. Doing so involves putting (perhaps updated)hypercall arguments in respective registers. For guests not running in64-bit mode this further involves a certain amount of translation of thevalues. Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated valuesassumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking ahypercall. When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a consistencycheck in the hypervisor and causes a crash.",
