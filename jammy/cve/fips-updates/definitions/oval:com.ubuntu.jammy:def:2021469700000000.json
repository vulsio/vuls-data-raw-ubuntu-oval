		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bus:mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueue A recentchange created a dedicated workqueue for the state-change work withWQ_HIGHPRI (no strong reason for that) and WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags, but thestate-change work (mhi_pm_st_worker) does not guarantee forward progressunder memory pressure, and will even wait on various memory allocationswhen e.g. creating devices, loading firmware, etc... The work is then notpart of a memory reclaim path...
