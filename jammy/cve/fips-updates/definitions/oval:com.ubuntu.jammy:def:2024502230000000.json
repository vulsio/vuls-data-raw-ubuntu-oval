But before themunmap system call returns to user mode, a potential task_numa_work()for numa balancing could be added and executed. In this scenario, since thechild process has no vma after munmap, the vma_next() in task_numa_work()will return a null pointer even if the vma iterator restarts from 0.Recheck the vma pointer before dereferencing it in task_numa_work().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50223` to fix the vulnerability.
