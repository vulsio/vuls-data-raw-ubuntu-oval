		"description": "DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML,MathML and SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using specialnesting techniques can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify inrecent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype Pollution to weakenthe depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross sitescripting (XSS) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All users are advised to upgrade. There are noknown workarounds for this vulnerability.",
