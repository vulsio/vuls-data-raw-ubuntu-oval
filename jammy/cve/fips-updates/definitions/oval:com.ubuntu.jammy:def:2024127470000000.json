		"description": "A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a race conditionduring rsync's handling of symbolic links. Rsync's default behavior whenencountering symbolic links is to skip them. If an attacker replaced aregular file with a symbolic link at the right time, it was possible tobypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links. Depending on theprivileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak sensitiveinformation, potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-12747` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrsync - 3.2.7-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\nNo subscription required",
