When the network namespace is deleted, the net structureaccessed by tcp's timer handler function causes problems.To fix this problem, let's hold netns refcnt for the tcp kernel socket asdone in other modules. This is an ugly hack which can easily be backportedto earlier kernels. A proper fix which cleans up the interfaces willfollow, but may not be so easy to backport.",
