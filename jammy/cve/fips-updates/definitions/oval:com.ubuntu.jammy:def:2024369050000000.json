		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tcp:defer shutdown(SEND_SHUTDOWN) for TCP_SYN_RECV sockets TCP_SYN_RECV stateis really special, it is only used by cross-syn connections, mostly used byfuzzers. In the following crash [1], syzbot managed to trigger a divide byzero in tcp_rcv_space_adjust() A socket makes the following statetransitions, without ever calling tcp_init_transfer(), meaningtcp_init_buffer_space() is also not called. TCP_CLOSE connect()TCP_SYN_SENT TCP_SYN_RECV shutdown() -> tcp_shutdown(sk, SEND_SHUTDOWN)TCP_FIN_WAIT1 To fix this issue, change tcp_shutdown() to not perform aTCP_SYN_RECV -> TCP_FIN_WAIT1 transition, which makes no sense anyway. Whentcp_rcv_state_process() later changes socket state from TCP_SYN_RECV toTCP_ESTABLISH, then look at sk->sk_shutdown to finally enter TCP_FIN_WAIT1state, and send a FIN packet from a sane socket state. This meanstcp_send_fin() can now be called from BH context, and must use GFP_ATOMICallocations.
