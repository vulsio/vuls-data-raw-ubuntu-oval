		"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handlingcomponents. An OOB-read vulnerability has been found in the parse_ds64function within gstwavparse.c. The parse_ds64 function does not check thatthe buffer buf contains sufficient data before attempting to read from it,doing multiple GST_READ_UINT32_LE operations without performing boundarychecks. This can lead to an OOB-read when buf is smaller than expected.This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer,potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitivedata. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
