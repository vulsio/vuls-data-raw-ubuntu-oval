		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:stmmac: move the EST lock to struct stmmac_priv Reinitialize the whole ESTstructure would also reset the mutex lock which is embedded in the ESTstructure, and then trigger the following warning. To address this, movethe lock to struct stmmac_priv. We also need to reacquire the mutex lockwhen doing this initialization.
