		"description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl prior to v8.0.0where it reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the factthat an SSH option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurlmaintains a pool of previously used connections to reuse them forsubsequent transfers if the configurations match. However, two SSH settingswere omitted from the configuration check, allowing them to match easily,potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-27538` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.10\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.10\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.10\nlibcurl4 - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.10\nNo subscription required",
