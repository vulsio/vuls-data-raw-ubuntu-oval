		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Fix task hung while purging oob_skb in GC. syzbot reported a taskhung; at the same time, GC was looping infinitely inlist_for_each_entry_safe() for OOB skb. [0] syzbot demonstrated that thelist_for_each_entry_safe() was not actually safe in this case. A single skbcould have references for multiple sockets. If we free such a skb in thelist_for_each_entry_safe(), the current and next sockets could be unlinkedin a single iteration. unix_notinflight() uses list_del_init() to unlinkthe socket, so the prefetched next socket forms a loop itself andlist_for_each_entry_safe() never stops. Here, we must use while() and makesure we always fetch the first socket.
