As btrfs/167 is doing a NOCOW write this is to beexpected.Further analysis with drgn confirmed the assumption:  >>> inode = prog.crashed_thread().stack_trace()[11]['ordered'].inode  >>> btrfs_inode = drgn.container_of(inode, \"struct btrfs_inode\", \\         \t\t\t\t\"vfs_inode\")  >>> print(btrfs_inode.flags)  (u32)1As zoned emulation mode simulates conventional zones on regular devices,we cannot use zone-append for writing. But we're only attaching dummychecksums if we're doing a zone-append write.So for NOCOW zoned data writes on conventional zones, also attach adummy checksum.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40962` to fix the vulnerability.
