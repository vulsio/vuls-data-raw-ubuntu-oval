		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/af_unix: disable sending io_uring over sockets File referencecycles have caused lots of problems for io_uring in the past, and it stilldoesn't work exactly right and races with unix_stream_read_generic(). Thesafest fix would be to completely disallow sending io_uring files viasockets via SCM_RIGHT, so there are no possible cycles invloving registeredfiles and thus rendering SCM accounting on the io_uring side unnecessary.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52654` to fix the vulnerability.
