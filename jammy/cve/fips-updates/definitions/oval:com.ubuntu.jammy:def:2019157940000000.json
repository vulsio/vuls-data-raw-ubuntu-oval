		"description": "Overlayfs in the Linux kernel and shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to theLinux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, both replacevma->vm_file in their mmap handlers. On error the original value is notrestored, and the reference is put for the file to which vm_file points. Onupstream kernels this is not an issue, as no callers dereference vm_filefollowing after call_mmap() returns an error. However, the aufs patchschange mmap_region() to replace the fput() using a local variable withvma_fput(), which will fput() vm_file, leading to a refcount underflow.",
