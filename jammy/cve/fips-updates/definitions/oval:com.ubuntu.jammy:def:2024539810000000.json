		"description": "python-multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When parsingform data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \\r or LF \\n) in front ofthe first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. Thishappens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may causeexcessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this bysending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after thelast boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread fora significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stallthe event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resultingin a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18.",
