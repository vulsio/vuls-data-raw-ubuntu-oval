		"description": "Command go env is documented as outputting a shell script containing the Goenvironment. However, go env doesn't sanitize values, so executing itsoutput as a shell script can cause various bad bahaviors, includingexecuting arbitrary commands or inserting new environment variables. Thisissue is relatively minor because, in general, if an attacker can setarbitrary environment variables on a system, they have better attackvectors than making \"go env\" print them out.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-24531` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngolang-1.17 - 1.17.13-3ubuntu1.2\ngolang-1.17-go - 1.17.13-3ubuntu1.2\ngolang-1.17-src - 1.17.13-3ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
