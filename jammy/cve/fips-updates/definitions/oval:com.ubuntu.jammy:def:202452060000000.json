		"description": "A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn'sTfidfVectorizer, specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1,which was fixed in version 1.5.0. The vulnerability arises from theunexpected storage of all tokens present in the training data within the`stop_words_` attribute, rather than only storing the subset of tokensrequired for the TF-IDF technique to function. This behavior leads to thepotential leakage of sensitive information, as the `stop_words_` attributecould contain tokens that were meant to be discarded and not stored, suchas passwords or keys. The impact of this vulnerability varies based on thenature of the data being processed by the vectorizer.",
