We go into btrfs_get_tree_subvol(), but fc_mount() returns EBUSY  because our new fc is RW, different from the original fs.  Now we enter btrfs_reconfigure_for_mount(), which switches the RO flag  first so that we can grab the existing fs_info.  Then we reconfigure the fs to RW.- During reconfiguration, option/features check is skipped  This means we will restart the v2 cache clearing, and convert back to  v1 cache.  This will trigger fs writes, and since the original fs has \"rescue=all\"  option, it skips the csum tree read.  And eventually causing NULL pointer dereference in super block  writeback.[FIX]For reconfiguration caused by different subvolume RO/RW flags, ensure wealways run btrfs_check_options() to ensure we have proper hard ROrequirements met.In fact the function btrfs_check_options() doesn't really do manycomplex checks, but hard RO requirement and some feature dependencychecks, thus there is no special reason not to do the check for mountreconfiguration.",
