Hence recored the bfqq andthen access bfqq->waker_bfqq may trigger UAF. What's more, the waker_bfqqmay in the merge chain of bfqq, hence just recored waker_bfqq is stillnot safe.Fix the problem by adding a helper bfq_waker_bfqq() to check ifbfqq->waker_bfqq is in the merge chain, and current procress is the onlyholder.",
