In the extremely unlikely scenario thecompiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attemptto get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is splitinto multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with257 vCPUs:  CPU0                              CPU1  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;  vcpu = kvm->vcpu_array[0x1ff];As detected by KCSAN:  BUG: KCSAN: data-race in kvm_vcpu_on_spin [kvm] / kvm_vcpu_on_spin [kvm]  write to 0xffffc90025a92344 of 4 bytes by task 4340 on cpu 16:  kvm_vcpu_on_spin (arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:4112) kvm  handle_pause (arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:5929) kvm_intel  vmx_handle_exit (arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:?\t\t arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:6606) kvm_intel  vcpu_run (arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11107 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11211) kvm  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run (arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:?) kvm  kvm_vcpu_ioctl (arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:?) kvm  __se_sys_ioctl (fs/ioctl.c:52 fs/ioctl.c:904 fs/ioctl.c:890)  __x64_sys_ioctl (fs/ioctl.c:890)  x64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:33)  do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:?)  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)  read to 0xffffc90025a92344 of 4 bytes by task 4342 on cpu 4:  kvm_vcpu_on_spin (arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:4069) kvm  handle_pause (arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:5929) kvm_intel  vmx_handle_exit (arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:?\t\t\tarch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:6606) kvm_intel  vcpu_run (arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11107 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11211) kvm  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run (arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:?) kvm  kvm_vcpu_ioctl (arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:?) kvm  __se_sys_ioctl (fs/ioctl.c:52 fs/ioctl.c:904 fs/ioctl.c:890)  __x64_sys_ioctl (fs/ioctl.c:890)  x64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:33)  do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:?)  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)  value changed: 0x00000012 -> 0x00000000",
