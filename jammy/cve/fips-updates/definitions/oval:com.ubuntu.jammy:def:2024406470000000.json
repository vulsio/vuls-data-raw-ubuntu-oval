		"description": "sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentry'sPython SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed tosubprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Python's `subprocess` calls,all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However,if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you mayuse `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK,with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), thisexpectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are beingpassed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request#3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgradingto the latest SDK version. However, if it's not possible, and if passingenvironment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, youcan disable all default integrations.",
