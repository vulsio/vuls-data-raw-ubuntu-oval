		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ubifs:ubifs_symlink: Fix memleak of inode->i_link in error path For errorhandling path in ubifs_symlink(), inode will be marked as bad first, theniput() is invoked. If inode->i_link is initialized byfscrypt_encrypt_symlink() in encryption scenario, inode->i_link won't befreed by callchain ubifs_free_inode -> fscrypt_free_inode in error handlingpath, because make_bad_inode() has changed 'inode->i_mode' as 'S_IFREG'.Following kmemleak is easy to be reproduced by injecting error inubifs_jnl_update() when doing symlink in encryption scenario: unreferencedobject 0xffff888103da3d98 (size 8): comm \"ln\", pid 1692, jiffies 4294914701(age 12.045s) backtrace: kmemdup+0x32/0x70__fscrypt_encrypt_symlink+0xed/0x1c0 ubifs_symlink+0x210/0x300 [ubifs]vfs_symlink+0x216/0x360 do_symlinkat+0x11a/0x190 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xe0There are two ways fixing it: 1. Remove make_bad_inode() in error handlingpath. We can do that because ubifs_evict_inode() will do same processes forgood symlink inode and bad symlink inode, for inode->i_nlink checking isbefore is_bad_inode(). 2. Free inode->i_link before marking inode bad.Method 2 is picked, it has less influence, personally, I think.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26972` to fix the vulnerability.
