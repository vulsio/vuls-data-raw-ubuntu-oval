The node balancing logic inbalance_pgdat() evaluates all zones collectively.  If one or more zones(e.g., ZONE_DMA32) have enough free pages to meet their watermarks, theentire node is deemed balanced.  This causes balance_pgdat() to exit earlybefore incrementing the kswapd_failures, as it considers the overallmemory state acceptable, even though some zones (like ZONE_NORMAL) remainunder significant pressure.The patch ensures that zone_reclaimable_pages() includes free pages(NR_FREE_PAGES) in its calculation when no other reclaimable pages areavailable (e.g., file-backed or anonymous pages).  This change preventszones like ZONE_DMA32, which have sufficient free pages, from beingmistakenly deemed unreclaimable.  By doing so, the patch ensures propernode balancing, avoids masking pressure on other zones like ZONE_NORMAL,and prevents infinite loops in throttle_direct_reclaim() caused byallow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) repeatedly returning false.The kernel hangs due to a task stuck in throttle_direct_reclaim(), causedby a node being incorrectly deemed balanced despite pressure in certainzones, such as ZONE_NORMAL.
