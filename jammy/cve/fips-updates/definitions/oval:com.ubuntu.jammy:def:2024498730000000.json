		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/filemap: fix filemap_get_folios_contig THP panicPatch series \"memfd-pin huge page fixes\".Fix multiple bugs that occur when using memfd_pin_folios with hugetlbpages and THP.  The hugetlb bugs only bite when the page is not yetfaulted in when memfd_pin_folios is called.  The THP bug bites when thestarting offset passed to memfd_pin_folios is not huge page aligned.  Seethe commit messages for details.This patch (of 5):memfd_pin_folios on memory backed by THP panics if the requested startoffset is not huge page aligned:BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000036RIP: 0010:filemap_get_folios_contig+0xdf/0x290RSP: 0018:ffffc9002092fbe8 EFLAGS: 00010202RAX: 0000000000000002 RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 0000000000000002The fault occurs here, because xas_load returns a folio with value 2:    filemap_get_folios_contig()        for (folio = xas_load(&xas); folio && xas.xa_index <= end;                        folio = xas_next(&xas)) {                ...                if (!folio_try_get(folio))   <-- BOOM\"2\" is an xarray sibling entry.  We get it because memfd_pin_folios doesnot round the indices passed to filemap_get_folios_contig to huge pageboundaries for THP, so we load from the middle of a huge page range see asibling.  (It does round for hugetlbfs, at the is_file_hugepages test).To fix, if the folio is a sibling, then return the next index as thestarting point for the next call to filemap_get_folios_contig.",
