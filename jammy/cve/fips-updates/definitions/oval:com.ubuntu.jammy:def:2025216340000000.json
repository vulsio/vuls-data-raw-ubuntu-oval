To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (\"cpuset: breakkernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()\") added'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This couldlead to this warning.After the commit 2125c0034c5d (\"cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplugprocessing synchronous\"), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs towait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpusetoperations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't existanymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix thiswarning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the'cpuset_write_resmask'.",
