		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:fix check for attempt to corrupt spilled pointer When register is spilledonto a stack as a 1/2/4-byte register, we set slot_type[BPF_REG_SIZE - 1](plus potentially few more below it, depending on actual spill size). So tocheck if some stack slot has spilled register we need to consultslot_type[7], not slot_type[0]. To avoid the need to remember anddouble-check this in the future, just use is_spilled_reg() helper.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52462` to fix the vulnerability.
