		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:f2fs: check discard support for conventional zonesAs the helper function f2fs_bdev_support_discard() shows, f2fs checks ifthe target block devices support discard by callingbdev_max_discard_sectors() and bdev_is_zoned(). This check works wellfor most cases, but it does not work for conventional zones on zonedblock devices. F2fs assumes that zoned block devices support discard,and calls __submit_discard_cmd(). When __submit_discard_cmd() is calledfor sequential write required zones, it works fine since__submit_discard_cmd() issues zone reset commands instead of discardcommands. However, when __submit_discard_cmd() is called forconventional zones, __blkdev_issue_discard() is called even when thedevices do not support discard.The inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call was not a problem beforethe commit 30f1e7241422 (\"block: move discard checks into the ioctlhandler\") because __blkdev_issue_discard() checked if the target devicessupport discard or not. If not, it returned EOPNOTSUPP. After thecommit, __blkdev_issue_discard() no longer checks it. It always returnszero and sets NULL to the given bio pointer. This NULL pointer triggersf2fs_bug_on() in __submit_discard_cmd(). The BUG is recreated with thecommands below at the umount step, where /dev/nullb0 is a zoned null_blkwith 5GB total size, 128MB zone size and 10 conventional zones.$ mkfs.f2fs -f -m /dev/nullb0$ mount /dev/nullb0 /mnt$ for ((i=0;i<5;i++)); do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test bs=65536 count=1600conv=fsync; done$ umount /mntTo fix the BUG, avoid the inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call.When discard is requested for conventional zones, check if the devicesupports discard or not. If not, return EOPNOTSUPP.",
