		"description": "Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fixfor CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existingconnections that had already been accepted from having their requestsstarved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the sameprocess. However, new connections may still be starved by greedypersistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in thecluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive`connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would serviceonly a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections.This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting`queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using`puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because youwill open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is verysmall and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions ofPuma.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29509` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npuma - 5.5.2-2ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
