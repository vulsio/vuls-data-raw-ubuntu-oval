		"description": "A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder versions <=v0.1.37 where default credentials are enabled during the image buildprocessÂ when using the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU or raw providers. The credentialscan be used to gain root access. The credentials are disabled at theconclusion of the image build process. Kubernetes clusters are onlyaffected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builderproject. Because these images were vulnerable during the image buildprocess, they are affected only if an attacker was able to reach the VMwhere the image build was happening and used the vulnerability to modifythe image at the time the image build was occurring.",
