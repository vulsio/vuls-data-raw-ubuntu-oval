		"description": "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() isvulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular\"0::00:00:00/2\" was found to cause an issue. C-ares only uses this functioninternally for configuration purposes which would require an administratorto configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users mayexternally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus bevulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31130` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibc-ares2 - 1.18.1-1ubuntu0.22.04.2\nNo subscription required",
