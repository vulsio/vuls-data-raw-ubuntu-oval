		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:SUNRPC: lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless ->recv_mutex is held.So it is important to hold that mutex.  Otherwise a sysfs read cantrigger an oops.Commit 17f09d3f619a (\"SUNRPC: Check if the xprt is connected beforehandling sysfs reads\") appears to attempt to fix this problem, but itonly narrows the race window.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48816` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 6.5.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 6.5.0-1007.7~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-gcp - 6.5.0-1010.10~22.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-nvidia - 6.5.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-nvidia-64k - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1013-oracle - 6.5.0-1013.13~22.04.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1003-oem - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-starfive - 6.5.0-1007.8~22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
