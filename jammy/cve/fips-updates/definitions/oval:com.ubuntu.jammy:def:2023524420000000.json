		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ksmbd:validate session id and tree id in compound request `smb2_get_msg()` insmb2_get_ksmbd_tcon() and smb2_check_user_session() will always return thefirst request smb2 header in a compound request. if `SMB2_TREE_CONNECT_HE`is the first command in compound request, will return 0, i.e. The tree idcheck is skipped. This patch use ksmbd_req_buf_next() to get currentcommand in compound.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52442` to fix the vulnerability.
