		"description": "The ngtcp2 project is an effort to implement IETF QUIC protocol in C. Inaffected versions acks are not validated before being written to the qlogleading to a buffer overflow. In `ngtcp2_conn::conn_recv_pkt` for an ACK,there was new logic that got added to skip `conn_recv_ack` if an ack hasalready been processed in the payload. However, this causes us to also skip`ngtcp2_pkt_validate_ack`. The ack which was skipped still got written toqlog. The bug occurs in `ngtcp2_qlog::write_ack_frame`. It is now possibleto reach this code with an invalid ack, suppose `largest_ack=0` and`first_ack_range=15`. Subtracting `largest_ack - first_ack_range` will leadto an integer underflow which is 20 chars long. However, the ngtcp2 qlogcode assumes the number written is a signed integer and only accounts for19 characters of overhead (see `NGTCP2_QLOG_ACK_FRAME_RANGE_OVERHEAD`).Therefore, we overwrite the buffer causing a heap overflow. This is highpriority and could potentially impact many users if they enable qlog. qlogis disabled by default. Due to its overhead, it is most likely used fordebugging purpose, but the actual use is unknown. ngtcp2 v1.9.1 fixes thebug and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should notturn on qlog.",
