		"description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio andPython. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memoryleak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused byadding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of eachMatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able toexhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number(100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares withaiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.",
