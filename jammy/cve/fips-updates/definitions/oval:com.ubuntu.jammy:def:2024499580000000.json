		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ocfs2: reserve space for inline xattr before attaching reflink treeOne of our customers reported a crash and a corrupted ocfs2 filesystem.The crash was due to the detection of corruption.  Upon troubleshooting,the fsck -fn output showed the below corruption[EXTENT_LIST_FREE] Extent list in owner 33080590 claims 230 as the nextfree chain record,but fsck believes the largest valid value is 227.  Clamp the next recordvalue? nThe stat output from the debugfs.ocfs2 showed the following corruptionwhere the \"Next Free Rec:\" had overshot the \"Count:\" in the root metadatablock.

The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By thetime this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at thedestination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this functionreserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without evenchecking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reducesthe l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inlinexattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in thiscase up to 230), thereby causing corruption.The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destinationinode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified thefix.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-49958` to fix the vulnerability.
