		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: release svc_expkey/svc_export with rcu_workThe last reference for `cache_head` can be reduced to zero in `c_show`and `e_show`(using `rcu_read_lock` and `rcu_read_unlock`). Consequently,`svc_export_put` and `expkey_put` will be invoked, leading to twoissues:1. The `svc_export_put` will directly free ex_uuid. However,   `e_show`/`c_show` will access `ex_uuid` after `cache_put`, which can   trigger a use-after-free issue, shown below.   ==================================================================   BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in svc_export_show+0x362/0x430 [nfsd]   Read of size 1 at addr ff11000010fdc120 by task cat/870   CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 870 Comm: cat Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3+ #1   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS   1.16.1-2.fc37 04/01/2014   Call Trace:    <TASK>    dump_stack_lvl+0x53/0x70    print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x3a0    print_report+0xb9/0x280    kasan_report+0xae/0xe0    svc_export_show+0x362/0x430 [nfsd]    c_show+0x161/0x390 [sunrpc]    seq_read_iter+0x589/0x770    seq_read+0x1e5/0x270    proc_reg_read+0xe1/0x140    vfs_read+0x125/0x530    ksys_read+0xc1/0x160    do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e   Allocated by task 830:    kasan_save_stack+0x20/0x40    kasan_save_track+0x14/0x30    __kasan_kmalloc+0x8f/0xa0    __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof+0x1bc/0x400    kmemdup_noprof+0x22/0x50    svc_export_parse+0x8a9/0xb80 [nfsd]    cache_do_downcall+0x71/0xa0 [sunrpc]    cache_write_procfs+0x8e/0xd0 [sunrpc]    proc_reg_write+0xe1/0x140    vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0    ksys_write+0xc1/0x160    do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e   Freed by task 868:    kasan_save_stack+0x20/0x40    kasan_save_track+0x14/0x30    kasan_save_free_info+0x3b/0x60    __kasan_slab_free+0x37/0x50    kfree+0xf3/0x3e0    svc_export_put+0x87/0xb0 [nfsd]    cache_purge+0x17f/0x1f0 [sunrpc]    nfsd_destroy_serv+0x226/0x2d0 [nfsd]    nfsd_svc+0x125/0x1e0 [nfsd]    write_threads+0x16a/0x2a0 [nfsd]    nfsctl_transaction_write+0x74/0xa0 [nfsd]    vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0    ksys_write+0xc1/0x160    do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e2.
