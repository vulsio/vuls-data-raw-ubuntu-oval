Neither me nor my brief tests couldn't findany potential caveats in calculating the maps right after performingdelay calibration, but the WARN splat is now gone.The very same debug prints now yield exactly what I expected fromthem:[    0.048433] CPU: 1, smt_mask: 0-1[0]https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mips/linux.git/commit/?id=76ce7cfe35ef\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48845` to fix the vulnerability.
