As for now, the maximal read size for kvec iter isonly limited by fc->max_read. For virtio-fs, max_read is UINT_MAX, sofuse_direct_io() doesn't split the 10MB buffer. It saves the address andthe size of the 10MB-sized buffer in out_args[0] of a fuse request andpasses the fuse request to virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock().4) virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock() uses virtio_fs_enqueue_req() toqueue the request. Because virtiofs need DMA-able address, sovirtio_fs_enqueue_req() uses kmalloc() to allocate a bounce buffer forall fuse args, copies these args into the bounce buffer and passed thephysical address of the bounce buffer to virtiofsd. The total length ofthese fuse args for the passed fuse request is about 10MB, socopy_args_to_argbuf() invokes kmalloc() with a 10MB size parameter andit triggers the warning in __alloc_pages():\tif (WARN_ON_ONCE_GFP(order > MAX_PAGE_ORDER, gfp))\t\treturn NULL;5) virtio_fs_enqueue_req() will retry the memory allocation in akworker, but it won't help, because kmalloc() will always return NULLdue to the abnormal size and finit_module() will hang forever.A feasible solution is to limit the value of max_read for virtio-fs, sothe length passed to kmalloc() will be limited. However it will affectthe maximal read size for normal read. And for virtio-fs write initiatedfrom kernel, it has the similar problem but now there is no way to limitfc->max_write in kernel.So instead of limiting both the values of max_read and max_write inkernel, introducing use_pages_for_kvec_io in fuse_conn and setting it astrue in virtiofs. When use_pages_for_kvec_io is enabled, fuse will usepages instead of pointer to pass the KVEC_IO data.After switching to pages for KVEC_IO data, these pages will be used forDMA through virtio-fs. If these pages are backed by vmalloc(),{flush|invalidate}_kernel_vmap_range() are necessary to flush orinvalidate the cache before the DMA operation. So add two new fields infuse_args_pages to record the base address of vmalloc area and thecondition indicating whether invalidation is needed. Perform the flushin fuse_get_user_pages() for write operations and the invalidation infuse_release_user_pages() for read operations.It may seem necessary to introduce another fie---truncated---",
