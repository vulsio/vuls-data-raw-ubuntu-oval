		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort path The delete setcommand does not rely on the transaction object for element removal,therefore, a combination of delete element + delete set from the abort pathcould result in restoring twice the refcount of the mapping. Check forinactive element in the next generation for the delete element command inthe abort path, skip restoring state if next generation bit has beenalready cleared. This is similar to the activate logic using the set walkiterator.
