There are 2 signals to tell dpc_thread to terminate (UNLOADINGflag and kthread_stop).On setting the UNLOADING flag when dpc_thread happens to run at the timeand sees the flag, this causes dpc_thread to exit and clean upitself. When kthread_stop is called for final cleanup, this causes useafter free.Remove UNLOADING signal to terminate dpc_thread.
