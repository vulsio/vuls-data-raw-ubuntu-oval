		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under sk_receive_queue lock. BillyJheng Bing-Jhong reported a race between __unix_gc() and queue_oob().__unix_gc() tries to garbage-collect close()d inflight sockets, and then ifthe socket has MSG_OOB in unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, GC will drop the referenceand set NULL to it locklessly. However, the peer socket still can sendMSG_OOB message and queue_oob() can update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skbconcurrently, leading NULL pointer dereference. [0] To fix the issue, let'supdate unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under the sk_receive_queue's lock and take iteverywhere we touch oob_skb. Note that we defer kfree_skb() in manage_oob()to silence lockdep false-positive (See [1]).
