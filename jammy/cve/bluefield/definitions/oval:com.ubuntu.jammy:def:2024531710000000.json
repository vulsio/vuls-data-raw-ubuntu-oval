		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ubifs: authentication: Fix use-after-free in ubifs_tnc_end_commitAfter an insertion in TNC, the tree might split and cause a node tochange its `znode->parent`. A further deletion of other nodes in thetree (which also could free the nodes), the aforementioned node's`znode->cparent` could still point to a freed node. This`znode->cparent` may not be updated when getting nodes to commit in`ubifs_tnc_start_commit()`. This could then trigger a use-after-freewhen accessing the `znode->cparent` in `write_index()` in`ubifs_tnc_end_commit()`.This can be triggered by running  rm -f /etc/test-file.bin  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/test-file.bin bs=1M count=60 conv=fsyncin a loop, and with `CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_AUTHENTICATION`.

More specifically, consider the following TNC:         zroot         /        /      zp1      /     /    znInserting a new node `zn_new` with a key smaller then `zn` will triggera split in `tnc_insert()` if `zp1` is full:         zroot         /   \\        /     \\      zp1     zp2      /         \\     /           \\  zn_new          zn`zn->parent` has now been moved to `zp2`, *but* `zn->cparent` stillpoints to `zp1`.Now, consider a removal of all the nodes _except_ `zn`. Just when`tnc_delete()` is about to delete `zroot` and `zp2`:         zroot             \\              \\              zp2                \\                 \\                 zn`zroot` and `zp2` get freed and the tree collapses:           zn`zn` now becomes the new `zroot`.`get_znodes_to_commit()` will now only find `zn`, the new `zroot`, and`write_index()` will check its `znode->cparent` that wrongly points tothe already freed `zp1`. `ubifs_copy_hash()` thus gets wrongly calledwith `znode->cparent->zbranch[znode->iip].hash` that triggers theuse-after-free!Fix this by explicitly setting `znode->cparent` to `NULL` in`get_znodes_to_commit()` for the root node.
