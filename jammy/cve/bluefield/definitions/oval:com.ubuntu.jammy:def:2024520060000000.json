		"description": "Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with anunusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations andfull access to internals. Git defines a line-based protocol that is used toexchange information between Git and Git credential helpers. Someecosystems (most notably, .NET and node.js) interpret single CarriageReturn characters as newlines, which renders the protections againstCVE-2020-5260 incomplete for credential helpers that treat Carriage Returnsin this way. This issue has been addressed in commit `b01b9b8` which isincluded in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.1, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3,v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4.
