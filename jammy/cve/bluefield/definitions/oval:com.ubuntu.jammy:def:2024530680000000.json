		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware: arm_scmi: Fix slab-use-after-free in scmi_bus_notifier()The scmi_dev->name is released prematurely in __scmi_device_destroy(),which causes slab-use-after-free when accessing scmi_dev->name inscmi_bus_notifier(). So move the release of scmi_dev->name toscmi_device_release() to avoid slab-use-after-free.  |  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in strncmp+0xe4/0xec  |  Read of size 1 at addr ffffff80a482bcc0 by task swapper/0/1  |  |  CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 6.6.38-debug #1  |  Hardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
