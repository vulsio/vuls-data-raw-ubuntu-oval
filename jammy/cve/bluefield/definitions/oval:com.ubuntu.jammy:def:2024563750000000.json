		"description": "An integer underflow was discovered in Fort 1.6.3 and 1.6.4 before 1.6.5. Amalicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor canserve (via rsync or RRDP) a Manifest RPKI object containing an emptyfileList. Fort dereferences (and, shortly afterwards, writes to) this arrayduring a shuffle attempt, before the validation that would normally rejectit when empty. This out-of-bounds access is caused by an integer underflowthat causes the surrounding loop to iterate infinitely. Because the productis permanently stuck attempting to overshuffle an array that doesn'tactually exist, a crash is nearly guaranteed.",
