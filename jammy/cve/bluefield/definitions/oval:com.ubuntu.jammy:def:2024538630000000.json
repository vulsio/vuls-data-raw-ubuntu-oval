		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. In Synapse versions before1.120.1, enabling the dynamic_thumbnails option or processing a speciallycrafted request could trigger the decoding and thumbnail generation ofuncommon image formats, potentially invoking external tools likeGhostscript for processing. This significantly expands the attack surfacein a historically vulnerable area, presenting a risk that far outweighs thebenefit, particularly since these formats are rarely used on the open webor within the Matrix ecosystem. Synapse 1.120.1 addresses the issue byrestricting thumbnail generation to images in the following widely usedformats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.120.1.",
