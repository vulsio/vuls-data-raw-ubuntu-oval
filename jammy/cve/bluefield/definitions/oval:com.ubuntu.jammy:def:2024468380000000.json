		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:userfaultfd: don't BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page tableSince khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in filemappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are wrong - getrid of them.We could also remove the preceding \"if (unlikely(...))\" block, but then wecould reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for filemappings but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be finebut I think is not necessarily expected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46838` to fix the vulnerability.
