		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Call kfree_skb() for dead unix_(sk)->oob_skb in GC. syzbotreported a warning [0] in __unix_gc() with a repro, which creates asocketpair and sends one socket's fd to itself using the peer.socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, [3, 4]) = 0 sendmsg(4, {msg_name=NULL,msg_namelen=0, msg_iov=[{iov_base=\"\\360\", iov_len=1}], msg_iovlen=1,msg_control=[{cmsg_len=20, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET, cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS,cmsg_data=[3]}], msg_controllen=24, msg_flags=0},MSG_OOB|MSG_PROBE|MSG_DONTWAIT|MSG_ZEROCOPY) = 1 This forms a self-cyclicreference that GC should finally untangle but does not due to lack ofMSG_OOB handling, resulting in memory leak. Recently, commit 11498715f266(\"af_unix: Remove io_uring code for GC.\") removed io_uring's dead code inGC and revealed the problem. The code was executed at the final stage of GCand unconditionally moved all GC candidates from gc_candidates togc_inflight_list. That papered over the reported problem by always makingthe following WARN_ON_ONCE(!list_empty(&gc_candidates)) false. The problemhas been there since commit 2aab4b969002 (\"af_unix: fix struct pid leaks inOOB support\") added full scm support for MSG_OOB while fixing another bug.To fix this problem, we must call kfree_skb() for unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb ifthe socket still exists in gc_candidates after purging collected skb. Then,we need to set NULL to oob_skb before calling kfree_skb() because it callslast fput() and triggers unix_release_sock(), where we call duplicatekfree_skb(u->oob_skb) if not NULL. Note that the leaked socket remainedbeing linked to a global list, so kmemleak also could not detect it. Weneed to check /proc/net/protocol to notice the unfreed socket.
