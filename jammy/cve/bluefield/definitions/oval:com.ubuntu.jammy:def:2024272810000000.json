		"description": "An issue was discovered in RDoc 6.3.3 through 6.6.2, as distributed in Ruby3.x through 3.3.0. When parsing .rdoc_options (used for configuration inRDoc) as a YAML file, object injection and resultant remote code executionare possible because there are no restrictions on the classes that can berestored. (When loading the documentation cache, object injection andresultant remote code execution are also possible if there were a craftedcache.) The main fixed version is 6.6.3.1. For Ruby 3.0 users, a fixedversion is rdoc 6.3.4.1. For Ruby 3.1 users, a fixed version is rdoc6.4.1.1. For Ruby 3.2 users, a fixed version is rdoc 6.5.1.1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27281` to fix the vulnerability.
