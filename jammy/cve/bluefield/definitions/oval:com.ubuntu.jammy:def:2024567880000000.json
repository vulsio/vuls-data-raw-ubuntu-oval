		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: ethernet: oa_tc6: fix tx skb race condition between reference pointersThere are two skb pointers to manage tx skb's enqueued from n/w stack.waiting_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which needs to be processedand ongoing_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which is being processed.SPI thread prepares the tx data chunks from the tx skb pointed by theongoing_tx_skb pointer. When the tx skb pointed by the ongoing_tx_skb isprocessed, the tx skb pointed by the waiting_tx_skb is assigned toongoing_tx_skb and the waiting_tx_skb pointer is assigned with NULL.Whenever there is a new tx skb from n/w stack, it will be assigned towaiting_tx_skb pointer if it is NULL. Enqueuing and processing of a tx skbhandled in two different threads.Consider a scenario where the SPI thread processed an ongoing_tx_skb andit moves next tx skb from waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointerwithout doing any NULL check. At this time, if the waiting_tx_skb pointeris NULL then ongoing_tx_skb pointer is also assigned with NULL. Afterthat, if a new tx skb is assigned to waiting_tx_skb pointer by the n/wstack and there is a chance to overwrite the tx skb pointer with NULL inthe SPI thread. Finally one of the tx skb will be left as unhandled,resulting packet missing and memory leak.- Consider the below scenario where the TXC reported from the previoustransfer is 10 and ongoing_tx_skb holds an tx ethernet frame which can betransported in 20 TXCs and waiting_tx_skb is still NULL.\ttx_credits = 10; /* 21 are filled in the previous transfer */\tongoing_tx_skb = 20;\twaiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */- So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true.- After oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs()\tongoing_tx_skb = 10;\twaiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */- Perform SPI transfer.- Process SPI rx buffer to get the TXC from footers.- Now let's assume previously filled 21 TXCs are freed so we are good totransport the next remaining 10 tx chunks from ongoing_tx_skb.\ttx_credits = 21;\tongoing_tx_skb = 10;\twaiting_tx_skb = NULL;- So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true again.- In the oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs()\tongoing_tx_skb = NULL;\twaiting_tx_skb = NULL;- Now the below bad case might happen,Thread1 (oa_tc6_start_xmit)\tThread2 (oa_tc6_spi_thread_handler)---------------------------\t------------------------------------ if waiting_tx_skb is NULL\t\t\t\t- if ongoing_tx_skb is NULL\t\t\t\t- ongoing_tx_skb = waiting_tx_skb- waiting_tx_skb = skb\t\t\t\t- waiting_tx_skb = NULL\t\t\t\t...\t\t\t\t- ongoing_tx_skb = NULL- if waiting_tx_skb is NULL- waiting_tx_skb = skbTo overcome the above issue, protect the moving of tx skb reference fromwaiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer and assigning new tx skbto waiting_tx_skb pointer, so that the other thread can't access thewaiting_tx_skb pointer until the current thread completes moving the txskb reference safely.",
