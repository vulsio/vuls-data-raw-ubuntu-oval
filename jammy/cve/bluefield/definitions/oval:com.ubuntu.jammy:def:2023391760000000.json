		"description": "A flaw was found within the parsing of SMB2 requests that have a transformheader in the kernel ksmbd module. The issue results from the lack ofproper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read pastthe end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this to disclosesensitive information on affected installations of Linux. Only systems withksmbd enabled are vulnerable to this CVE.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39176` to fix the vulnerability.
