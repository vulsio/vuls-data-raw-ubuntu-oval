If err is -ENOMEM:  ext4_ext_dirty(path + path->p_depth)  // path use-after-free !!!  b. If err is -EIO and we have EXT_DEBUG defined:  ext4_ext_show_leaf(path)    eh = path[depth].p_hdr    // path also use-after-free !!!So when trying to zeroout or fix the extent length, call ext4_find_extent()to update the path.In addition we use *ppath directly as an ext4_ext_show_leaf() input toavoid possible use-after-free when EXT_DEBUG is defined, and to avoidunnecessary path updates.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-49884` to fix the vulnerability.
