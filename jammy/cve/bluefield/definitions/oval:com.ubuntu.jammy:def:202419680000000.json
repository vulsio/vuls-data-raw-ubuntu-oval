		"description": "In scrapy/scrapy, an issue was identified where the Authorization header isnot removed during redirects that only change the scheme (e.g., HTTPS toHTTP) but remain within the same domain. This behavior contravenes theFetch standard, which mandates the removal of Authorization headers incross-origin requests when the scheme, host, or port changes. Consequently,when a redirect downgrades from HTTPS to HTTP, the Authorization header maybe inadvertently exposed in plaintext, leading to potential sensitiveinformation disclosure to unauthorized actors. The flaw is located in the_build_redirect_request function of the redirect middleware.",
