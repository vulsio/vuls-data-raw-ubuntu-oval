		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bnxt_en: Fix aggregation ID mask to prevent oops on 5760X chipsThe 5760X (P7) chip's HW GRO/LRO interface is very similar to that ofthe previous generation (5750X or P5).  However, the aggregation IDfields in the completion structures on P7 have been redefined from16 bits to 12 bits.  The freed up 4 bits are redefined for part of themetadata such as the VLAN ID.  The aggregation ID mask was not modifiedwhen adding support for P7 chips.  Including the extra 4 bits for theaggregation ID can potentially cause the driver to store or fetch thepacket header of GRO/LRO packets in the wrong TPA buffer.  It may hitthe BUG() condition in __skb_pull() because the SKB contains no validpacket header:kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:2766!Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 1 PREEMPT SMP NOPTICPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/4 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G           OE    6.12.0-rc2+ #7Tainted: [O]=OOT_MODULE, [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULEHardware name: Dell Inc.
