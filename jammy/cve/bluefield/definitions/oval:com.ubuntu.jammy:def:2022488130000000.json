		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: dsa: felix: don't use devres for mdiobusAs explained in commits:74b6d7d13307 (\"net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres\")5135e96a3dd2 (\"net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres\")mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus wasnot previously unregistered.The Felix VSC9959 switch is a PCI device, so the initial set ofconstraints that I thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call->remove on ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more whichapplies here.If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device linkbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()will unbind the felix switch driver on shutdown.So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, whichis: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,or don't use devres at all.The felix driver has the code structure in place for orderly mdiobusremoval, so just replace devm_mdiobus_alloc_size() with the non-devresvariant, and add manual free where necessary, to ensure that we don'tlet devres free a still-registered bus.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48813` to fix the vulnerability.
