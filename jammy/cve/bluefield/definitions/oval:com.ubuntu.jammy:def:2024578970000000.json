		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdkfd: Correct the migration DMA map directionThe SVM DMA device map direction should be set the same asthe DMA unmap setting, otherwise the DMA core will reportthe following warning.Before finialize this solution, there're some discussion onthe DMA mapping type(stream-based or coherent) in this KFDmigration case, followed by https://lore.kernel.org/all/04d4ab32-45a1-4b88-86ee-fb0f35a0ca40@amd.com/T/.As there's no dma_sync_single_for_*() in the DMA buffer accessedthat because this migration operation should be sync properly andautomatically. Give that there's might not be a performance problemin various cache sync policy of DMA sync. Therefore, in order tosimplify the DMA direction setting alignment, let's set the DMA mapdirection as BIDIRECTIONAL.[  150.834218] WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 1812 at kernel/dma/debug.c:1028check_unmap+0x1cc/0x930[  150.834225] Modules linked in: amdgpu(OE) amdxcp drm_exec(OE) gpu_scheddrm_buddy(OE) drm_ttm_helper(OE) ttm(OE) drm_suballoc_helper(OE)drm_display_helper(OE) drm_kms_helper(OE) i2c_algo_bit rpcsec_gss_krb5auth_rpcgss nfsv4 nfs lockd grace netfs xt_conntrack xt_MASQUERADEnf_conntrack_netlink xfrm_user xfrm_algo iptable_nat xt_addrtypeiptable_filter br_netfilter nvme_fabrics overlay nfnetlink_cttimeoutnfnetlink openvswitch nsh nf_conncount nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6nf_defrag_ipv4 libcrc32c bridge stp llc sch_fq_codel intel_rapl_msr amd_atlintel_rapl_common snd_hda_codec_realtek snd_hda_codec_genericsnd_hda_scodec_component snd_hda_codec_hdmi snd_hda_intel snd_intel_dspcfgedac_mce_amd snd_pci_acp6x snd_hda_codec snd_acp_config snd_hda_coresnd_hwdep snd_soc_acpi kvm_amd sunrpc snd_pcm kvm binfmt_misc snd_seq_midicrct10dif_pclmul snd_seq_midi_event ghash_clmulni_intel sha512_ssse3snd_rawmidi nls_iso8859_1 sha256_ssse3 sha1_ssse3 snd_seq aesni_intelsnd_seq_device crypto_simd snd_timer cryptd input_leds[  150.834310]  wmi_bmof serio_raw k10temp rapl snd sp5100_tco ipmi_devintfsoundcore ccp ipmi_msghandler cm32181 industrialio mac_hid msr parport_pcppdev lp parport efi_pstore drm(OE) ip_tables x_tables pci_stubcrc32_pclmul nvme ahci libahci i2c_piix4 r8169 nvme_core i2c_designware_pcirealtek i2c_ccgx_ucsi video wmi hid_generic cdc_ether usbnet usbhid hidr8152 mii[  150.834354] CPU: 8 PID: 1812 Comm: rocrtst64 Tainted: G           OE 6.10.0-custom #492[  150.834358] Hardware name: AMD Majolica-RN/Majolica-RN, BIOS RMJ1009A06/13/2021[  150.834360] RIP: 0010:check_unmap+0x1cc/0x930[  150.834363] Code: c0 4c 89 4d c8 e8 34 bf 86 00 4c 8b 4d c8 4c 8b 45 c048 8b 4d b8 48 89 c6 41 57 4c 89 ea 48 c7 c7 80 49 b4 84 e8 b4 81 f3 ff<0f> 0b 48 c7 c7 04 83 ac 84 e8 76 ba fc ff 41 8b 76 4c 49 8d 7e 50[  150.834365] RSP: 0018:ffffaac5023739e0 EFLAGS: 00010086[  150.834368] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffffff8566a2e0 RCX:0000000000000027[  150.834370] RDX: ffff8f6a8f621688 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI:ffff8f6a8f621680[  150.834372] RBP: ffffaac502373a30 R08: 00000000000000c9 R09:ffffaac502373850[  150.834373] R10: ffffaac502373848 R11: ffffffff84f46328 R12:ffffaac502373a40[  150.834375] R13: ffff8f6741045330 R14: ffff8f6741a77700 R15:ffffffff84ac831b[  150.834377] FS:  00007faf0fc94c00(0000) GS:ffff8f6a8f600000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000[  150.834379] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[  150.834381] CR2: 00007faf0b600020 CR3: 000000010a52e000 CR4:0000000000350ef0[  150.834383] Call Trace:[  150.834385]  <TASK>[  150.834387]  ? show_regs+0x6d/0x80[  150.834393]  ? __warn+0x8c/0x140[  150.834397]  ? check_unmap+0x1cc/0x930[  150.834400]  ? report_bug+0x193/0x1a0[  150.834406]  ? handle_bug+0x46/0x80[  150.834410]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80[  150.834413]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30[  150.834420]  ? check_unmap+0x1cc/0x930[  150.834425]  debug_dma_unmap_page+0x86/0x90[  150.834431]  ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f[  150.834435]---truncated---",
