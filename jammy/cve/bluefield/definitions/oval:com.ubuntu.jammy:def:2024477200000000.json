		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Add null check for set_output_gamma indcn30_set_output_transfer_funcThis commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointerin the  dcn30_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously,set_output_gamma was being checked for nullity at line 386, but then itwas being dereferenced without any nullity check at line 401. Thiscould potentially lead to a null pointer dereference error ifset_output_gamma is indeed null.To fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null beforedereferencing it. We do this by adding a nullity check forset_output_gamma before the call to set_output_gamma at line 401. Ifset_output_gamma is null, we log an error message and do not call thefunction.This fix prevents a potential null pointer dereference error.drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:401dcn30_set_output_transfer_func()error: we previously assumed 'mpc->funcs->set_output_gamma' could be null(see line 386)drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c    373 bool dcn30_set_output_transfer_func(struct dc *dc,    374                                 struct pipe_ctx *pipe_ctx,    375                                 const struct dc_stream_state*stream)    376 {    377         int mpcc_id = pipe_ctx->plane_res.hubp->inst;    378         struct mpc *mpc =pipe_ctx->stream_res.opp->ctx->dc->res_pool->mpc;    379         const struct pwl_params *params = NULL;    380         bool ret = false;    381    382         /* program OGAM or 3DLUT only for the top pipe*/    383         if (pipe_ctx->top_pipe == NULL) {    384                 /*program rmu shaper and 3dlut in MPC*/    385                 ret = dcn30_set_mpc_shaper_3dlut(pipe_ctx, stream);    386                 if (ret == false && mpc->funcs->set_output_gamma) {                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Ifthis is NULL    387                         if (stream->out_transfer_func.type ==TF_TYPE_HWPWL)    388                                 params =&stream->out_transfer_func.pwl;    389                         else if(pipe_ctx->stream->out_transfer_func.type ==    390                                         TF_TYPE_DISTRIBUTED_POINTS&&    391cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format(    392                                         &stream->out_transfer_func,    393                                         &mpc->blender_params,false))    394                                 params = &mpc->blender_params;    395                          /* there are no ROM LUTs in OUTGAM */    396                         if (stream->out_transfer_func.type ==TF_TYPE_PREDEFINED)    397                                 BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER();    398                 }    399         }    400--> 401         mpc->funcs->set_output_gamma(mpc, mpcc_id, params);                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Then it will crash    402         return ret;    403 }\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47720` to fix the vulnerability.
