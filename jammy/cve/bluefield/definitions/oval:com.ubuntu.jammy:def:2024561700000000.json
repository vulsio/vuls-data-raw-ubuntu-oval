		"description": "A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before2.0.0. RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients aresupposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct, the most recentversion of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to preventreplays, accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber andthisUpdate fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a givenmanifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-likesequential number, and the latter is the date on which the manifest wascreated. However, the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of themost recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it'sprone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdatedmanifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.",
