The following ftrace log shows that the lockup CPU spends too much     time iterating vmap_nodes and flushing TLB when purging vm_area     structures. (Some info is trimmed).     kworker: funcgraph_entry:              |  drain_vmap_area_work() {     kworker: funcgraph_entry:              |   mutex_lock() {     kworker: funcgraph_entry:  1.092 us    |     __cond_resched();     kworker: funcgraph_exit:   3.306 us    |   }     ...                                        ...     kworker: funcgraph_entry:              |    flush_tlb_kernel_range() {     ...                                          ...     kworker: funcgraph_exit: # 7533.649 us |    }     ...                                         ...     kworker: funcgraph_entry:  2.344 us    |   mutex_unlock();     kworker: funcgraph_exit: $ 23871554 us | }     The drain_vmap_area_work() spends over 23 seconds.     There are 2805 flush_tlb_kernel_range() calls in the ftrace log.       * One is called in __purge_vmap_area_lazy().       * Others are called by purge_vmap_node->kasan_release_vmalloc.         purge_vmap_node() iteratively releases kasan vmalloc         allocations and flushes TLB for each vmap_area.           - [Rough calculation] Each flush_tlb_kernel_range() runs             about 7.5ms.               -- 2804 * 7.5ms = 21.03 seconds.               -- That's why a soft lock is triggered.  2.
