		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:target: core: Avoid smp_processor_id() in preemptible code The BUG message\"BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code\" was observedfor TCMU devices with kernel config DEBUG_PREEMPT. The message was observedwhen blktests block/005 was run on TCMU devices with fileio backend oruser:zbc backend [1]. The commit 1130b499b4a7 (\"scsi: target: tcm_loop: UseLIO wq cmd submission helper\") triggered the symptom. The commit modifiedwork queue to handle commands and changed 'current->nr_cpu_allowed' atsmp_processor_id() call. The message was also observed at system shutdownwhen TCMU devices were not cleaned up [2]. The function smp_processor_id()was called in SCSI host work queue for abort handling, and triggered theBUG message. This symptom was observed regardless of the commit1130b499b4a7 (\"scsi: target: tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper\").To avoid the preemptible code check at smp_processor_id(), get CPU ID withraw_smp_processor_id() instead. The CPU ID is used for performanceimprovement then thread move to other CPU will not affect the code.
