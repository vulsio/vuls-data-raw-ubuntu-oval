BTRFS: error (device vdc: state EA)in cleanup_transaction:2055: errno=-2 No such entry This happens becausecreate_pending_snapshot() initializes the new root item as a copy of thesource root item. This includes the refs field, which is 0 for a deletedsubvolume. The call to btrfs_insert_root() therefore inserts a root withrefs == 0. btrfs_get_new_fs_root() then finds the root and returns -ENOENTif refs == 0, which causes create_pending_snapshot() to abort. Fix it bychecking the source root's refs before attempting the snapshot, but afterlocking subvol_sem to avoid racing with deletion.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26644` to fix the vulnerability.
