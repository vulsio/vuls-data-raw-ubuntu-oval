		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mwifiex: bring down link before deleting interface We can deadlock whenrmmod'ing the driver or going through firmware reset, because thecfg80211_unregister_wdev() has to bring down the link for us, ... whichthen grab the same wiphy lock. nl80211_del_interface() already handles avery similar case, with a nice description: /* * We hold RTNL, so this issafe, without RTNL opencount cannot * reach 0, and thus the rdev cannot bedeleted. * * We need to do it for the dev_close(), since that will call *the netdev notifiers, and we need to acquire the mutex there * but don'tknow if we get there from here or from some other * place (e.g. \"ip linkset ... down\"). */ mutex_unlock(&rdev->wiphy.mtx); ... Do similarly formwifiex teardown, by ensuring we bring the link down first. Sample deadlocktrace: [ 247.103516] INFO: task rmmod:2119 blocked for more than 123seconds.
