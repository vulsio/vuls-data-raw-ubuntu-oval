That commit introducedvma->fence->active in order for the fence_update() to be able to waitselectively on that one instead of vma->active since only idleness offence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a(\"drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal\") replaced the call tofence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), andalso added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(&fence->active)) in front.No justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness ofvma->fence->active without first waiting on it.The issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fenceregisters on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invokedon completion of a request that was using them on the other, stillprocessed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it bywaiting for idleness of vma->fence->active in i915_vma_revoke_fence().(cherry picked from commit 24bb052d3dd499c5956abad5f7d8e4fd07da7fb1)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41092` to fix the vulnerability.
