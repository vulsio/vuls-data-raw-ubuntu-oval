		"title": "CVE-2023-52455 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-preview 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iommu:Don't reserve 0-length IOVA region When the bootloader/firmware doesn'tsetup the framebuffers, their address and size are 0 in \"iommu-addresses\"property. If IOVA region is reserved with 0 length, then it ends upcorrupting the IOVA rbtree with an entry which has pfn_hi < pfn_lo. If weintend to use display driver in kernel without framebuffer then it'scausing the display IOMMU mappings to fail as entire valid IOVA space isreserved when address and length are passed as 0. An ideal solution wouldbe firmware removing the \"iommu-addresses\" property and corresponding\"memory-region\" if display is not present. But the kernel should be able tohandle this by checking for size of IOVA region and skipping the IOVAreservation if size is 0. Also, add a warning if firmware is requesting0-length IOVA region reservation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52455` to fix the vulnerability.
