		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc failure aftercheck_estalblished(). syzkaller reported a warning [0] ininet_csk_destroy_sock() with no repro. WARN_ON(inet_sk(sk)->inet_num &&!inet_csk(sk)->icsk_bind_hash); However, the syzkaller's log hinted thatconnect() failed just before the warning due to FAULT_INJECTION. [1] Whenconnect() is called for an unbound socket, we search for an availableephemeral port. If a bhash bucket exists for the port, we call__inet_check_established() or __inet6_check_established() to check if thebucket is reusable. If reusable, we add the socket into ehash and setinet_sk(sk)->inet_num. Later, we look up the corresponding bhash2 bucketand try to allocate it if it does not exist. Although it rarely occurs inreal use, if the allocation fails, we must revert the changes bycheck_established(). Otherwise, an unconnected socket could illegallyoccupy an ehash entry. Note that we do not put tw back into ehash becausesk might have already responded to a packet for tw and it would be betterto free tw earlier under such memory presure.
