		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: send: fix buffer overflow detection when copying path to cache entryStarting with commit c0247d289e73 (\"btrfs: send: annotate structname_cache_entry with __counted_by()\") we annotated the variable lengtharray \"name\" from the name_cache_entry structure with __counted_by() toimprove overflow detection. However that alone was not correct, becausethe length of that array does not match the \"name_len\" field - it matchesthat plus 1 to include the NUL string terminator, so that makes afortified kernel think there's an overflow and report a splat like this:  strcpy: detected buffer overflow: 20 byte write of buffer size 19  WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 3310 at __fortify_report+0x45/0x50  CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 3310 Comm: btrfs Not tainted 6.11.0-prnet #1  Hardware name: CompuLab Ltd.  sbc-ihsw/Intense-PC2 (IPC2), BIOSIPC2_3.330.7 X64 03/15/2018  RIP: 0010:__fortify_report+0x45/0x50  Code: 48 8b 34 (...)
