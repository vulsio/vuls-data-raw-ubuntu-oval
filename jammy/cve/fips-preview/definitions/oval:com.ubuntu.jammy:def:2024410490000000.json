		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:filelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inodeLight Hsieh reported a KASAN UAF warning in trace_posix_lock_inode().The request pointer had been changed earlier to point to a lock entrythat was added to the inode's list. However, before the tracepoint couldfire, another task raced in and freed that lock.Fix this by moving the tracepoint inside the spinlock, which shouldensure that this doesn't happen.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41049` to fix the vulnerability.
