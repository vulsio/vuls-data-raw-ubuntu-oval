Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a   keyring.2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points   to a shortcut.                      NODE A              +------>+---+      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6      +---+   |       +---+ xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6      +---+   |       +---+ xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6      +---+   |       +---+      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6      +---+           +---+ xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6      +---+           +---+ xxe6 | f |      +---+4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read   out-of-bounds read.To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is ashortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.[1]https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes tag.]",
