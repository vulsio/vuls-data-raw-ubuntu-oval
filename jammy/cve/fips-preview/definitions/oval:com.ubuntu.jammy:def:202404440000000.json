		"description": "GStreamer AV1 Video Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote CodeExecution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers toexecute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interactionwith this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attackvectors may vary depending on the implementation. The specific flaw existswithin the parsing of tile list data within AV1-encoded video files. Theissue results from the lack of proper validation of the length ofuser-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-basedbuffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in thecontext of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22873.",
