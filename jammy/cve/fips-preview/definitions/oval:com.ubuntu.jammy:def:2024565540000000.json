		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: fix freeze UAF in binder_release_work()When a binder reference is cleaned up, any freeze work queued in theassociated process should also be removed. Otherwise, the reference isfreed while its ref->freeze.work is still queued in proc->work leadingto a use-after-free issue as shown by the following KASAN report:  ==================================================================  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in binder_release_work+0x398/0x3d0  Read of size 8 at addr ffff31600ee91488 by task kworker/5:1/211  CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 211 Comm: kworker/5:1 Not tainted6.11.0-rc7-00382-gfc6c92196396 #22  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)  Workqueue: events binder_deferred_func  Call trace:   binder_release_work+0x398/0x3d0   binder_deferred_func+0xb60/0x109c   process_one_work+0x51c/0xbd4   worker_thread+0x608/0xee8  Allocated by task 703:   __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x130/0x280   binder_thread_write+0xdb4/0x42a0   binder_ioctl+0x18f0/0x25ac   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x124/0x190   invoke_syscall+0x6c/0x254  Freed by task 211:   kfree+0xc4/0x230   binder_deferred_func+0xae8/0x109c   process_one_work+0x51c/0xbd4   worker_thread+0x608/0xee8  ==================================================================This commit fixes the issue by ensuring any queued freeze work is removedwhen cleaning up a binder reference.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-56554` to fix the vulnerability.
