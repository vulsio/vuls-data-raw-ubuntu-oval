		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfs: fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput()Hi, allRecently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it intoand I believe it'a race in vfs.Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 iscalled by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread callinggeneric_shutdown_super().cpu0:                              cpu1:iput() // i_count is 1  ->spin_lock(inode)  ->dec i_count to 0  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count))continue;      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out   ->spin_unlock()// note here: the inode 261// was still at sb list and hash list,// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been setbtrfs_iget()  // after some function calls  ->find_inode()    // found the above inode 261    ->spin_lock(inode)   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE   // and passed      ->__iget()    ->spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back                                        ->spin_lock(inode)                                        // check(I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,                                        // passed and set I_FREEINGiput()                                  ->spin_unlock(inode)  ->spin_lock(inode)\t\t\t  ->evict()  // dec i_count to 0  ->iput_final()    ->spin_unlock()    ->evict()Now, we have two threads simultaneously evictingthe same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)statement both within clear_inode() and iput().To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, andthe overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.[1]:https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/000000000000eabe1d0619c48986@google.com/[2]: The reason might be 1.
