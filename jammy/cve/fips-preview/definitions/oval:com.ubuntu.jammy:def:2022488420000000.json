Command 'ip link ... set nomaster' causes that ice_plug_aux_dev()   is called from ice_service_task() context, aux device is created   and associated device->lock is taken.2. Command 'ip link ... set master...' calls ice's notifier under   RTNL lock and that notifier calls ice_unplug_aux_dev(). That   function tries to take aux device->lock but this is already taken   by ice_plug_aux_dev() in step 13. Later ice_plug_aux_dev() tries to take RTNL lock but this is already   taken in step 24. Dead-lockThe patch fixes this issue by following changes:- Bit ICE_FLAG_PLUG_AUX_DEV is kept to be set during ice_plug_aux_dev()  call in ice_service_task()- The bit is checked in ice_clear_rdma_cap() and only if it is not set  then ice_unplug_aux_dev() is called. If it is set (in other words  plugging of aux device was requested and ice_plug_aux_dev() is  potentially running) then the function only clears the---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48842` to fix the vulnerability.
