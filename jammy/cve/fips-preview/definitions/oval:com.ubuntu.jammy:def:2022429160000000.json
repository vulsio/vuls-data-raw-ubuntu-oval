		"description": "In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it intostaying with HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to useHTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step) even whenHTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCIIcounterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using the character UTF-8U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop ofU+002E (.). The earliest affected version is 7.77.0 2021-05-26.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42916` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.6\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.6\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.6\nlibcurl4 - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.6\nNo subscription required",
