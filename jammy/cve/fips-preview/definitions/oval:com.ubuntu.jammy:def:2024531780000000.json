		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:smb: Don't leak cfid when reconnect races with open_cached_diropen_cached_dir() may either race with the tcon reconnection even beforecompound_send_recv() or directly trigger a reconnection viaSMB2_open_init() or SMB_query_info_init().The reconnection process invokes invalidate_all_cached_dirs() viacifs_mark_open_files_invalid(), which removes all cfids from thecfids->entries list but doesn't drop a ref if has_lease isn't true. Thisresults in the currently-being-constructed cfid not being on the list,but still having a refcount of 2. It leaks if returned fromopen_cached_dir().Fix this by setting cfid->has_lease when the ref is actually taken; thecfid will not be used by other threads until it has a valid time.Addresses these kmemleaks:unreferenced object 0xffff8881090c4000 (size 1024):  comm \"bash\", pid 1860, jiffies 4295126592  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    00 01 00 00 00 00 ad de 22 01 00 00 00 00 ad de  ........\".......    00 ca 45 22 81 88 ff ff f8 dc 4f 04 81 88 ff ff  ..E\"......O.....  backtrace (crc 6f58c20f):    [<ffffffff8b895a1e>] __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x2be/0x350    [<ffffffff8bda06e3>] open_cached_dir+0x993/0x1fb0    [<ffffffff8bdaa750>] cifs_readdir+0x15a0/0x1d50    [<ffffffff8b9a853f>] iterate_dir+0x28f/0x4b0    [<ffffffff8b9a9aed>] __x64_sys_getdents64+0xfd/0x200    [<ffffffff8cf6da05>] do_syscall_64+0x95/0x1a0    [<ffffffff8d00012f>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7eunreferenced object 0xffff8881044fdcf8 (size 8):  comm \"bash\", pid 1860, jiffies 4295126592  hex dump (first 8 bytes):    00 cc cc cc cc cc cc cc                          ........  backtrace (crc 10c106a9):    [<ffffffff8b89a3d3>] __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof+0x363/0x480    [<ffffffff8b7d7256>] kstrdup+0x36/0x60    [<ffffffff8bda0700>] open_cached_dir+0x9b0/0x1fb0    [<ffffffff8bdaa750>] cifs_readdir+0x15a0/0x1d50    [<ffffffff8b9a853f>] iterate_dir+0x28f/0x4b0    [<ffffffff8b9a9aed>] __x64_sys_getdents64+0xfd/0x200    [<ffffffff8cf6da05>] do_syscall_64+0x95/0x1a0    [<ffffffff8d00012f>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7eAnd addresses these BUG splats when unmounting the SMB filesystem:BUG: Dentry ffff888140590ba0{i=1000000000080,n=/}  still in use (2)[unmount of cifs cifs]WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 3433 at fs/dcache.c:1536 umount_check+0xd0/0x100Modules linked in:CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 3433 Comm: bash Not tainted6.12.0-rc4-g850925a8133c-dirty #49Hardware name: VMware, Inc.
