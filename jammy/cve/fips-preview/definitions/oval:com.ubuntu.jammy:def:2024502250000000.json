		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix error propagation of split biosThe purpose of btrfs_bbio_propagate_error() shall be propagating an errorof split bio to its original btrfs_bio, and tell the error to the upperlayer. However, it's not working well on some cases.* Case 1. Immediate (or quick) end_bio with an errorWhen btrfs sends btrfs_bio to mirrored devices, btrfs callsbtrfs_bio_end_io() when all the mirroring bios are completed. If thatbtrfs_bio was split, it is from btrfs_clone_bioset and its end_io functionis btrfs_orig_write_end_io. For this case, btrfs_bbio_propagate_error()accesses the orig_bbio's bio context to increase the error count.That works well in most cases. However, if the end_io is called enoughfast, orig_bbio's (remaining part after split) bio context may not beproperly set at that time. Since the bio context is set when the orig_bbio(the last btrfs_bio) is sent to devices, that might be too late for earliersplit btrfs_bio's completion.  That will result in NULL pointerdereference.That bug is easily reproducible by running btrfs/146 on zoned devices [1]and it shows the following trace.[1] You need raid-stripe-tree feature as it create \"-d raid0 -m raid1\" FS.
