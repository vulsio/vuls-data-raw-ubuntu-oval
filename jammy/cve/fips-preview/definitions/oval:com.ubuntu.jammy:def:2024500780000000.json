Without that, the struct proto that iso_init() registered withproto_register() becomes invalid, which could cause unpredictableproblems later. In my case, with CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED andCONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION enabled, loading the module again usuallytriggers this BUG():  list_add corruption. next->prev should be prev (ffffffffb5355fd0),    but was 0000000000000068.
