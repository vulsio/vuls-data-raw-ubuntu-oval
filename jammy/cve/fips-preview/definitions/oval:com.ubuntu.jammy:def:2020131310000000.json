		"description": "An issue was discovered in Yubico libykpiv before 2.1.0. lib/util.c in thislibrary (which is included in yubico-piv-tool) does not properly checkembedded length fields during device communication. A malicious PIV tokencan misreport the returned length fields during RSA key generation. Thiswill cause stack memory to be copied into heap allocated memory that getsreturned to the caller. The leaked memory could include PINs, passwords,key material, and other sensitive information depending on the integration.During further processing by the caller, this information could leak acrosstrust boundaries. Note that RSA key generation is triggered by the host andcannot directly be triggered by the token.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-13131` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibykpiv2 - 2.1.1-3\nykcs11 - 2.1.1-3\nyubico-piv-tool - 2.1.1-3\nNo subscription required",
