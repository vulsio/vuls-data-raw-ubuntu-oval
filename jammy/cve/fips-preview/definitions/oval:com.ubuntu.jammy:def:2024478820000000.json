		"description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Priorto version 3.8.3, the built-in \"Something went wrong!\" error page includesthe exception message and exception traceback without escaping HTML tags,enabling injection into the page if an attacker can reliably produce anerror with an attacker-influenced message. It appears that the only way toreach this code in OpenRefine itself is for an attacker to somehow convincea victim to import a malicious file, which may be difficult.  However,out-of-tree extensions may add their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`.Version 3.8.3 has a fix for this issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47882` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenrefine - 3.5.2-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
