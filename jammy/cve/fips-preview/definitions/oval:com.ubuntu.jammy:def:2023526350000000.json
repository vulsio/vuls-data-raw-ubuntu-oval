		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: PM /devfreq: Synchronize devfreq_monitor_[start/stop] There is a chance if afrequent switch of the governor done in a loop result in timer listcorruption where timer cancel being done from two place one fromcancel_delayed_work_sync() and followed by expire_timers() can be seen fromthe traces[1]. while true do echo \"simple_ondemand\" >/sys/class/devfreq/1d84000.ufshc/governor echo \"performance\" >/sys/class/devfreq/1d84000.ufshc/governor done It looks to be issue withdevfreq driver where device_monitor_[start/stop] need to synchronized sothat delayed work should get corrupted while it is either being queued orrunning or being cancelled. Let's use polling flag and devfreq lock tosynchronize the queueing the timer instance twice and work data beingcorrupted.
