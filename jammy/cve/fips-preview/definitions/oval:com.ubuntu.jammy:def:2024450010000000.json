		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: mana: Fix RX buf alloc_size alignment and atomic op panicThe MANA driver's RX buffer alloc_size is passed into napi_build_skb() tocreate SKB. skb_shinfo(skb) is located at the end of skb, and its alignmentis affected by the alloc_size passed into napi_build_skb(). The size needsto be aligned properly for better performance and atomic operations.Otherwise, on ARM64 CPU, for certain MTU settings like 4000, atomicoperations may panic on the skb_shinfo(skb)->dataref due to alignmentfault.To fix this bug, add proper alignment to the alloc_size calculation.Sample panic info:[  253.298819] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual addressffff000129ba5cce[  253.300900] Mem abort info:[  253.301760]   ESR = 0x0000000096000021[  253.302825]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits[  253.304268]   SET = 0, FnV = 0[  253.305172]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0[  253.306103]   FSC = 0x21: alignment faultCall trace: __skb_clone+0xfc/0x198 skb_clone+0x78/0xe0 raw6_local_deliver+0xfc/0x228 ip6_protocol_deliver_rcu+0x80/0x500 ip6_input_finish+0x48/0x80 ip6_input+0x48/0xc0 ip6_sublist_rcv_finish+0x50/0x78 ip6_sublist_rcv+0x1cc/0x2b8 ipv6_list_rcv+0x100/0x150 __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x180/0x220 netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x198/0x2a8 __napi_poll+0x138/0x250 net_rx_action+0x148/0x330 handle_softirqs+0x12c/0x3a0\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45001` to fix the vulnerability.
