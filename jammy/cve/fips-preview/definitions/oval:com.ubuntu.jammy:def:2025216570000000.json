		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched_ext: Replace rq_lock() to raw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass()scx_ops_bypass() iterates all CPUs to re-enqueue all the scx tasks.For each CPU, it acquires a lock using rq_lock() regardless of whethera CPU is offline or the CPU is currently running a task in a higherscheduler class (e.g., deadline). The rq_lock() is supposed to be usedfor online CPUs, and the use of rq_lock() may trigger an unnecessarywarning in rq_pin_lock(). Therefore, replace rq_lock() toraw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass().Without this change, we observe the following warning:===== START =====[    6.615205] rq->balance_callback && rq->balance_callback !=&balance_push_callback[    6.615208] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/sched.h:1730__schedule+0x1130/0x1c90=====  END  =====",
