		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:smb: prevent use-after-free due to open_cached_dir error pathsIf open_cached_dir() encounters an error parsing the lease from theserver, the error handling may race with receiving a lease break,resulting in open_cached_dir() freeing the cfid while the queued work ispending.Update open_cached_dir() to drop refs rather than directly freeing thecfid.Have cached_dir_lease_break(), cfids_laundromat_worker(), andinvalidate_all_cached_dirs() clear has_lease immediately while stillholding cfids->cfid_list_lock, and then use this to also simplify thereference counting in cfids_laundromat_worker() andinvalidate_all_cached_dirs().Fixes this KASAN splat (which manually injects an error and lease breakin open_cached_dir()):==================================================================BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in smb2_cached_lease_break+0x27/0xb0Read of size 8 at addr ffff88811cc24c10 by task kworker/3:1/65CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 65 Comm: kworker/3:1 Not tainted6.12.0-rc6-g255cf264e6e5-dirty #87Hardware name: VMware, Inc.
