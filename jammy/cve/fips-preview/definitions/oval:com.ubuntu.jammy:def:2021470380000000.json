		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: avoid deadlock between hci_dev->lock and socket lock Commiteab2404ba798 (\"Bluetooth: Add BT_PHY socket option\") added a dependencybetween socket lock and hci_dev->lock that could lead to deadlock. It turnsout that hci_conn_get_phy() is not in any way relying on hdev beingimmutable during the runtime of this function, neither does it even look atany of the members of hdev, and as such there is no need to hold that lock.This fixes the lockdep splat below:====================================================== WARNING: possiblecircular locking dependency detected 5.12.0-rc1-00026-g73d464503354 #10 Nottainted ------------------------------------------------------bluetoothd/1118 is trying to acquire lock: ffff8f078383c078(&hdev->lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: hci_conn_get_phy+0x1c/0x150 [bluetooth] buttask is already holding lock: ffff8f07e831d920(sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_L2CAP){+.+.}-{0:0}, at:l2cap_sock_getsockopt+0x8b/0x610 which lock already depends on the newlock. the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is: -> #3(sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_L2CAP){+.+.}-{0:0}:lock_sock_nested+0x72/0xa0 l2cap_sock_ready_cb+0x18/0x70 [bluetooth]l2cap_config_rsp+0x27a/0x520 [bluetooth] l2cap_sig_channel+0x658/0x1330[bluetooth] l2cap_recv_frame+0x1ba/0x310 [bluetooth]hci_rx_work+0x1cc/0x640 [bluetooth] process_one_work+0x244/0x5f0worker_thread+0x3c/0x380 kthread+0x13e/0x160 ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30 -> #2(&chan->lock#2/1){+.+.}-{3:3}: __mutex_lock+0xa3/0xa10l2cap_chan_connect+0x33a/0x940 [bluetooth] l2cap_sock_connect+0x141/0x2a0[bluetooth] __sys_connect+0x9b/0xc0 __x64_sys_connect+0x16/0x20do_syscall_64+0x33/0x80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae -> #1(&conn->chan_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}: __mutex_lock+0xa3/0xa10l2cap_chan_connect+0x322/0x940 [bluetooth] l2cap_sock_connect+0x141/0x2a0[bluetooth] __sys_connect+0x9b/0xc0 __x64_sys_connect+0x16/0x20do_syscall_64+0x33/0x80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae -> #0(&hdev->lock){+.+.}-{3:3}: __lock_acquire+0x147a/0x1a50lock_acquire+0x277/0x3d0 __mutex_lock+0xa3/0xa10hci_conn_get_phy+0x1c/0x150 [bluetooth] l2cap_sock_getsockopt+0x5a9/0x610[bluetooth] __sys_getsockopt+0xcc/0x200 __x64_sys_getsockopt+0x20/0x30do_syscall_64+0x33/0x80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae other infothat might help us debug this: Chain exists of: &hdev->lock -->&chan->lock#2/1 --> sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_L2CAP Possible unsafelocking scenario: CPU0 CPU1 ---- ----lock(sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_L2CAP); lock(&chan->lock#2/1);lock(sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_L2CAP); lock(&hdev->lock); *** DEADLOCK*** 1 lock held by bluetoothd/1118: #0: ffff8f07e831d920(sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_L2CAP){+.+.}-{0:0}, at:l2cap_sock_getsockopt+0x8b/0x610 [bluetooth] stack backtrace: CPU: 3 PID:1118 Comm: bluetoothd Not tainted 5.12.0-rc1-00026-g73d464503354 #10Hardware name: LENOVO 20K5S22R00/20K5S22R00, BIOS R0IET38W (1.16 )05/31/2017 Call Trace: dump_stack+0x7f/0xa1 check_noncircular+0x105/0x120 ?__lock_acquire+0x147a/0x1a50 __lock_acquire+0x147a/0x1a50lock_acquire+0x277/0x3d0 ? hci_conn_get_phy+0x1c/0x150 [bluetooth] ?__lock_acquire+0x2e1/0x1a50 ? lock_is_held_type+0xb4/0x120 ?hci_conn_get_phy+0x1c/0x150 [bluetooth] __mutex_lock+0xa3/0xa10 ?hci_conn_get_phy+0x1c/0x150 [bluetooth] ? lock_acquire+0x277/0x3d0 ?mark_held_locks+0x49/0x70 ? mark_held_locks+0x49/0x70 ?hci_conn_get_phy+0x1c/0x150 [bluetooth] hci_conn_get_phy+0x ---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47038` to fix the vulnerability.
