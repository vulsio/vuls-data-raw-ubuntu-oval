		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepointPatch series \"nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints\".This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when usingnilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.This patch (of 2):It has been reported that when using \"block:block_touch_buffer\"tracepoint, touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes aNULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when KASAN isenabled.This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer(), itreferences the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether thebuffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the currentimplementation, the block_device structure is set after the functionreturns to the caller.Here, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the bufferhead as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by thecaller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when itwas reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to calltouch_buffer() here in the first place.So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.",
