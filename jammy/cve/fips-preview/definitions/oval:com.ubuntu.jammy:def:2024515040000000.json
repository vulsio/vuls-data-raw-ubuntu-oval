		"description": "When using IPAuthenticationProvider in ZooKeeper Admin Server there is apossibility of Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -- this only impacts IPbased authentication implemented in ZooKeeper Admin Server. Defaultconfiguration of client's IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider,which uses HTTP request headers, is weak and allows an attacker to bypassauthentication via spoofing client's IP address in request headers. Defaultconfiguration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to read client's IPaddress. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers toidentify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretendingthat the request comes from a different IP address. Admin Server commands,such as snapshot and restore arbitrarily can be executed on successfulexploitation which could potentially lead to information leakage or serviceavailability issues. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.3,which fixes this issue.",
