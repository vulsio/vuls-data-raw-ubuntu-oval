		"description": "In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fieldsprovided to the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it is notpossible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\nis in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd filewhen viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work aroundblocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that anew user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able toconvince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect,social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that \"cat/etc/passwd\" shows a rogue user account.",
