		"title": "CVE-2022-3602 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-preview 22.04 LTS (jammy) - high",
		"description": "A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs aftercertificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to havesigned the malicious certificate or for the application to continuecertificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trustedissuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow fourattacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could resultin a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote codeexecution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which wouldmitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be furthermitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL.Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described abovehave led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged toupgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can betriggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can betriggered if the server requests client authentication and a maliciousclient connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3602` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.7\nopenssl - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.7\nNo subscription required",
