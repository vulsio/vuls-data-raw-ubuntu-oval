		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tty: serial: qcom-geni-serial: fix slab-out-of-bounds on RX FIFO bufferDriver's probe allocates memory for RX FIFO (port->rx_fifo) based ondefault RX FIFO depth, e.g. 16.  Later during serial startup theqcom_geni_serial_port_setup() updates the RX FIFO depth(port->rx_fifo_depth) to match real device capabilities, e.g. to 32.The RX UART handle code will read \"port->rx_fifo_depth\" number of wordsinto \"port->rx_fifo\" buffer, thus exceeding the bounds.  This can beobserved in certain configurations with Qualcomm Bluetooth HCI UARTdevice and KASAN:  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Product ID   :0x00000010  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA SOC Version  :0x400a0200  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA ROM Version  :0x00000200  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Patch Version:0x00000d2b  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA controller version 0x02000200  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Downloading qca/htbtfw20.tlv  bluetooth hci0: Direct firmware load for qca/htbtfw20.tlv failed witherror -2  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Failed to request file: qca/htbtfw20.tlv (-2)  Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Failed to download patch (-2)  ==================================================================  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in handle_rx_uart+0xa8/0x18c  Write of size 4 at addr ffff279347d578c0 by task swapper/0/0  CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted6.1.0-rt5-00350-gb2450b7e00be-dirty #26  Hardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
