		"description": "A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which allowscontainers to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem into buildcontainers. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symboliclink to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operationto mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands insidethe RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem,allowing for full container escape at build time.",
