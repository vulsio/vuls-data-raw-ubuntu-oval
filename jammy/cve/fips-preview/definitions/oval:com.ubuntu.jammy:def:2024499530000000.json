		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Fix crash caused by calling __xfrm_state_delete() twiceThe km.state is not checked in driver's delayed work. Whenxfrm_state_check_expire() is called, the state can be reset toXFRM_STATE_EXPIRED, even if it is XFRM_STATE_DEAD already. Thishappens when xfrm state is deleted, but not freed yet. As__xfrm_state_delete() is called again in xfrm timer, the followingcrash occurs.To fix this issue, skip xfrm_state_check_expire() if km.state is notXFRM_STATE_VALID.
