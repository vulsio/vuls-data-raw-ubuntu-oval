		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: Fix soft lockups in fib6_select_path under high next hop churnSoft lockups have been observed on a cluster of Linux-based edge routerslocated in a highly dynamic environment. Using the `bird` service, theserouters continuously update BGP-advertised routes due to frequentlychanging nexthop destinations, while also managing significant IPv6traffic. The lockups occur during the traversal of the multipathcircular linked-list in the `fib6_select_path` function, particularlywhile iterating through the siblings in the list. The issue typicallyarises when the nodes of the linked list are unexpectedly deletedconcurrently on a different coreâ€”indicated by their 'next' and'previous' elements pointing back to the node itself and their referencecount dropping to zero. This results in an infinite loop, leading to asoft lockup that triggers a system panic via the watchdog timer.Apply RCU primitives in the problematic code sections to resolve theissue. Where necessary, update the references to fib6_siblings toannotate or use the RCU APIs.Include a test script that reproduces the issue. The scriptperiodically updates the routing table while generating a heavy loadof outgoing IPv6 traffic through multiple iperf3 clients. Itconsistently induces infinite soft lockups within a couple of minutes.Kernel log: 0 [ffffbd13003e8d30] machine_kexec at ffffffff8ceaf3eb 1 [ffffbd13003e8d90] __crash_kexec at ffffffff8d0120e3 2 [ffffbd13003e8e58] panic at ffffffff8cef65d4 3 [ffffbd13003e8ed8] watchdog_timer_fn at ffffffff8d05cb03 4 [ffffbd13003e8f08] __hrtimer_run_queues at ffffffff8cfec62f 5 [ffffbd13003e8f70] hrtimer_interrupt at ffffffff8cfed756 6 [ffffbd13003e8fd0] __sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8cea01af 7 [ffffbd13003e8ff0] sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8df1b83d-- <IRQ stack> -- 8 [ffffbd13003d3708] asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8e000ecb    [exception RIP: fib6_select_path+299]    RIP: ffffffff8ddafe7b  RSP: ffffbd13003d37b8  RFLAGS: 00000287    RAX: ffff975850b43600  RBX: ffff975850b40200  RCX: 0000000000000000    RDX: 000000003fffffff  RSI: 0000000051d383e4  RDI: ffff975850b43618    RBP: ffffbd13003d3800   R8: 0000000000000000   R9: ffff975850b40200    R10: 0000000000000000  R11: 0000000000000000  R12: ffffbd13003d3830    R13: ffff975850b436a8  R14: ffff975850b43600  R15: 0000000000000007    ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff  CS: 0010  SS: 0018 9 [ffffbd13003d3808] ip6_pol_route at ffffffff8ddb030c10 [ffffbd13003d3888] ip6_pol_route_input at ffffffff8ddb068c11 [ffffbd13003d3898] fib6_rule_lookup at ffffffff8ddf02b512 [ffffbd13003d3928] ip6_route_input at ffffffff8ddb0f4713 [ffffbd13003d3a18] ip6_rcv_finish_core.constprop.0 at ffffffff8dd950d014 [ffffbd13003d3a30] ip6_list_rcv_finish.constprop.0 at ffffffff8dd9627415 [ffffbd13003d3a98] ip6_sublist_rcv at ffffffff8dd9647416 [ffffbd13003d3af8] ipv6_list_rcv at ffffffff8dd9661517 [ffffbd13003d3b60] __netif_receive_skb_list_core at ffffffff8dc16fec18 [ffffbd13003d3be0] netif_receive_skb_list_internal at ffffffff8dc176b319 [ffffbd13003d3c50] napi_gro_receive at ffffffff8dc565b920 [ffffbd13003d3c80] ice_receive_skb at ffffffffc087e4f5 [ice]21 [ffffbd13003d3c90] ice_clean_rx_irq at ffffffffc0881b80 [ice]22 [ffffbd13003d3d20] ice_napi_poll at ffffffffc088232f [ice]23 [ffffbd13003d3d80] __napi_poll at ffffffff8dc1800024 [ffffbd13003d3db8] net_rx_action at ffffffff8dc1858125 [ffffbd13003d3e40] __do_softirq at ffffffff8df352e926 [ffffbd13003d3eb0] run_ksoftirqd at ffffffff8ceffe4727 [ffffbd13003d3ec0] smpboot_thread_fn at ffffffff8cf36a3028 [ffffbd13003d3ee8] kthread at ffffffff8cf2b39f29 [ffffbd13003d3f28] ret_from_fork at ffffffff8ce5fa6430 [ffffbd13003d3f50] ret_from_fork_asm at ffffffff8ce03cbb",
