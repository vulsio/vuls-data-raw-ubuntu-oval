		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Track subprog poke descriptors correctly and fix use-after-free Subprogramsare calling map_poke_track(), but on program release there is no hook tocall map_poke_untrack(). However, on program release, the aux memory (andpoke descriptor table) is freed even though we still have a reference to itin the element list of the map aux data. When we run map_poke_run(), wethen end up accessing free'd memory, triggering KASAN inprog_array_map_poke_run(): [...] [ 402.824689] BUG: KASAN: use-after-freein prog_array_map_poke_run+0xc2/0x34e [ 402.824698] Read of size 4 at addrffff8881905a7940 by task hubble-fgs/4337 [ 402.824705] CPU: 1 PID: 4337Comm: hubble-fgs Tainted: G I 5.12.0+ #399 [ 402.824715] Call Trace: [402.824719] dump_stack+0x93/0xc2 [ 402.824727]print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1a/0x140 [ 402.824736] ?prog_array_map_poke_run+0xc2/0x34e [ 402.824740] ?prog_array_map_poke_run+0xc2/0x34e [ 402.824744]kasan_report.cold+0x7c/0xd8 [ 402.824752] ?prog_array_map_poke_run+0xc2/0x34e [ 402.824757]prog_array_map_poke_run+0xc2/0x34e [ 402.824765]bpf_fd_array_map_update_elem+0x124/0x1a0 [...] The elements concerned arewalked as follows: for (i = 0; i < elem->aux->size_poke_tab; i++) { poke =&elem->aux->poke_tab[i]; [...] The access to size_poke_tab is a 4 byteread, verified by checking offsets in the KASAN dump: [ 402.825004] Thebuggy address belongs to the object at ffff8881905a7800 which belongs tothe cache kmalloc-1k of size 1024 [ 402.825008] The buggy address islocated 320 bytes inside of 1024-byte region [ffff8881905a7800,ffff8881905a7c00) The pahole output of bpf_prog_aux: struct bpf_prog_aux {[...] /* --- cacheline 5 boundary (320 bytes) --- */ u32 size_poke_tab; /*320 4 */ [...] In general, subprograms do not necessarily manage their owndata structures. For example, BTF func_info and linfo are just pointers tothe main program structure. This allows reference counting and cleanup tobe done on the latter which simplifies their management a bit. Theaux->poke_tab struct, however, did not follow this logic. The initialproposed fix for this use-after-free bug further embedded poke datatracking into the subprogram with proper reference counting. However,Daniel and Alexei questioned why we were treating these objects special; Iagree, its unnecessary. The fix here removes the per subprogram poke tableallocation and map tracking and instead simply points the aux->poke_tabpointer at the main programs poke table. This way, map tracking issimplified to the main program and we do not need to manage them persubprogram. This also means, bpf_prog_free_deferred(), which unwinds theprogram reference counting and kfrees objects, needs to ensure that wedon't try to double free the poke_tab when free'ing the subprog structures.This is easily solved by NULL'ing the poke_tab pointer. The second detailis to ensure that per subprogram JIT logic only does fixups on poke_tab[]entries it owns. To do this, we add a pointer in the poke structure topoint at the subprogram value so JITs can easily check while walking thepoke_tab structure if the current entry belongs to the current program. Theaux pointer is stable and therefore suitable for such comparison. On thejit_subprogs() error path, we omit cleaning up the poke->aux field becausethese are only ever referenced from the JIT side, but on error we willnever make it to the JIT, so its fine to leave them dangling. Removingthese pointers would complicate the error path for no reason. However, wedo need to untrack all poke descriptors from the main program as otherwisethey could race with the freeing of JIT memory from the subprograms.Lastly, a748c6975dea3 (\"bpf: propagate poke des ---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47303` to fix the vulnerability.
