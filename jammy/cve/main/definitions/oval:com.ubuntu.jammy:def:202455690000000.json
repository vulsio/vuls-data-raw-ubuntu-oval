		"description": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the jaraco/zipp library,affecting all versions prior to 3.19.1. The vulnerability is triggered whenprocessing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop.This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from thethird-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affectedcode is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiatedthrough the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp andzipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and`iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, itprevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressedin version 3.19.1 of jaraco/zipp.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-5569` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-zipp - 1.0.0-3ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
