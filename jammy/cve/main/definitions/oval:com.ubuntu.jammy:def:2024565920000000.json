		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Call free_htab_elem() after htab_unlock_bucket()For htab of maps, when the map is removed from the htab, it may hold thelast reference of the map. bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() will invokebpf_map_free_id() to free the id of the removed map element. However,bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() is invoked while holding a bucket lock(raw_spin_lock_t), and bpf_map_free_id() attempts to acquire map_idr_lock(spinlock_t), triggering the following lockdep warning:  =============================  [ BUG: Invalid wait context ]  6.11.0-rc4+ #49 Not tainted  -----------------------------  test_maps/4881 is trying to lock:  ffffffff84884578 (map_idr_lock){+...}-{3:3}, at:bpf_map_free_id.part.0+0x21/0x70  other info that might help us debug this:  context-{5:5}  2 locks held by test_maps/4881:   #0: ffffffff846caf60 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{1:3}, at:bpf_fd_htab_map_update_elem+0xf9/0x270   #1: ffff888149ced148 (&htab->lockdep_key#2){....}-{2:2}, at:htab_map_update_elem+0x178/0xa80  stack backtrace:  CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 4881 Comm: test_maps Not tainted 6.11.0-rc4+ #49  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), ...

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokesidr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger asimilar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) isstill a spinlock.Instead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invokinghtab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferringthe invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old mappointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion.Therefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so theseto-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.There are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr:(1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())It invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation ofhtab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(),because the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems.It may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and theinvocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may releasethe newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointerof the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket andreleasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the oldelement, should do the same thing for the special fields in the oldelement as well.(2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())Its caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(),htab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().For htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() afterhtab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), justlike lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free listand invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safeto reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because theseelements have been removed from the hash llist.Because htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation,__htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so keptit as---truncated---",
