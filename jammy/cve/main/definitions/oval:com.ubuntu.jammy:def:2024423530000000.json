		"description": "WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses. When WebObnormalizes the HTTP Location header to include the request hostname, itdoes so by parsing the URL that the user is to be redirected to withPython's urlparse, and joining it to the base URL. `urlparse` howevertreats a `//` at the start of a string as a URI without a scheme, and thentreats the next part as the hostname. `urljoin` will then use that hostnamefrom the second part as the hostname replacing the original one from therequest. This vulnerability is patched in WebOb version 1.8.8.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42353` to fix the vulnerability.
