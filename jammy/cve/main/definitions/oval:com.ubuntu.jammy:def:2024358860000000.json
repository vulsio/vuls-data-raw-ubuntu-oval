		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6:Fix infinite recursion in fib6_dump_done(). syzkaller reported infiniterecursive calls of fib6_dump_done() during netlink socket destruction. [1]From the log, syzkaller sent an AF_UNSPEC RTM_GETROUTE message, and thenthe response was generated. The following recvmmsg() resumed the dump forIPv6, but the first call of inet6_dump_fib() failed at kzalloc() due to thefault injection. [0] 12:01:34 executing program 3: r0 =socket$nl_route(0x10, 0x3, 0x0) sendmsg$nl_route(r0, ... snip ...)recvmmsg(r0, ... snip ...) (fail_nth: 8) Here, fib6_dump_done() was set tonlk_sk(sk)->cb.done, and the next call of inet6_dump_fib() set it tonlk_sk(sk)->cb.args[3]. syzkaller stopped receiving the response halfwaythrough, and finally netlink_sock_destruct() called nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done().fib6_dump_done() calls fib6_dump_end() and nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done() if it isstill not NULL. fib6_dump_end() rewrites nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done() bynlk_sk(sk)->cb.args[3], but it has the same function, not NULL, callingitself recursively and hitting the stack guard page. To avoid the issue,let's set the destructor after kzalloc().
