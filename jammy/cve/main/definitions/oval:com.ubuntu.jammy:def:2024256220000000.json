		"description": "h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. Theconfiguration directives provided by the headers handler allows users tomodify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file ofh2o has scopes, and the inner scopes (e.g., path level) are expected toinherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g., global level).However, if a header directive is used in the inner scope, all thedefinition in outer scopes are ignored. This can lead to headers not beingmodified as expected. Depending on the headers being added or removedunexpectedly, this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior. Thisvulnerability is fixed in commit 123f5e2b65dcdba8f7ef659a00d24bd1249141be.",
