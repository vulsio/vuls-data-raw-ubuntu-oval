It stems from behaviorenabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for manyclient options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitlyenabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack ofproper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring ona per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of theclient's intended destination directory. A malicious server could writemalicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/pathson the client.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-12087` to fix the vulnerability.
