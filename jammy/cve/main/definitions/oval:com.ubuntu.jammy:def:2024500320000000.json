		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rcu/nocb: Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirqAfter a CPU has set itself offline and before it eventually callsrcutree_report_cpu_dead(), there are still opportunities for callbacksto be enqueued, for example from a softirq. When that happens on NOCB,the rcuog wake-up is deferred through an IPI to an online CPU in ordernot to call into the scheduler and risk arming the RT-bandwidth afterhrtimers have been migrated out and disabled.But performing a synchronized IPI from a softirq is buggy as reported inthe following scenario:        WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 26 at kernel/smp.c:633smp_call_function_single        Modules linked in: rcutorture torture        CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 26 Comm: migration/1 Not tainted6.11.0-rc1-00012-g9139f93209d1 #1        Stopper: multi_cpu_stop+0x0/0x320 <- __stop_cpus+0xd0/0x120        RIP: 0010:smp_call_function_single        <IRQ>        swake_up_one_online        __call_rcu_nocb_wake        __call_rcu_common        ? rcu_torture_one_read        call_timer_fn        __run_timers        run_timer_softirq        handle_softirqs        irq_exit_rcu        ? tick_handle_periodic        sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt        </IRQ>Fix this with forcing deferred rcuog wake up through the NOCB timer whenthe CPU is offline.
