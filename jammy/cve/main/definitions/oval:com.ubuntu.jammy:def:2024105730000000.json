		"description": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in mpg123 when handling craftedstreams. When decoding PCM, the libmpg123 may write past the end of aheap-located buffer. Consequently, heap corruption may happen, andarbitrary code execution is not discarded. The complexity required toexploit this flaw is considered high as the payload must be validated bythe MPEG decoder and the PCM synth before execution. Additionally, tosuccessfully execute the attack, the user must scan through the stream,making web live stream content (such as web radios) a very unlikely attackvector.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-10573` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmpg123-0 - 1.29.3-1ubuntu0.1\nlibout123-0 - 1.29.3-1ubuntu0.1\nlibsyn123-0 - 1.29.3-1ubuntu0.1\nmpg123 - 1.29.3-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
