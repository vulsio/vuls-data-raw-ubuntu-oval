		"description": "There's a out-of-bounds write issue in mpg123, the vulnerability is locatedwhen handling crafted streams. During the decoding of PCM the libmpg123 maywrite past the end of a heap located buffer, as consequence heap corruptionmay happen and arbitrary code execution is not discarded. The complexityrequired to exploit this flaw is considered high as the payload needs to bevalidated by the MPEG decoder and by the PCM synth before beingexecuted. Additionally to successfully execute the attack,the user needs toscan through the stream making web live stream content (such as web radios)a very unlikely attack vector.",
