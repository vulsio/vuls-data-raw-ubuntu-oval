		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: hci: fix null-ptr-deref in hci_read_supported_codecsFix __hci_cmd_sync_sk() to return not NULL for unknown opcodes.__hci_cmd_sync_sk() returns NULL if a command returns a status event.However, it also returns NULL where an opcode doesn't exist in thehci_cc table because hci_cmd_complete_evt() assumes status = skb->data[0]for unknown opcodes.This leads to null-ptr-deref in cmd_sync for HCI_OP_READ_LOCAL_CODECS asthere is no hci_cc for HCI_OP_READ_LOCAL_CODECS, which always assumesstatus = skb->data[0].KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000070-0x0000000000000077]CPU: 1 PID: 2000 Comm: kworker/u9:5 Not tainted 6.9.0-ga6bcb805883c-dirty#10Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-104/01/2014Workqueue: hci7 hci_power_onRIP: 0010:hci_read_supported_codecs+0xb9/0x870net/bluetooth/hci_codec.c:138Code: 08 48 89 ef e8 b8 c1 8f fd 48 8b 75 00 e9 96 00 00 00 49 89 c6 48 ba00 00 00 00 00 fc ff df 4c 8d 60 70 4c 89 e3 48 c1 eb 03 <0f> b6 04 13 84c0 0f 85 82 06 00 00 41 83 3c 24 02 77 0a e8 bf 78RSP: 0018:ffff888120bafac8 EFLAGS: 00010212RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 000000000000000e RCX: ffff8881173f0040RDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: ffffffffa58496c0 RDI: ffff88810b9ad1e4RBP: ffff88810b9ac000 R08: ffffffffa77882a7 R09: 1ffffffff4ef1054R10: dffffc0000000000 R11: fffffbfff4ef1055 R12: 0000000000000070R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff88810b9ac000FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8881f6c00000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007f6ddaa3439e CR3: 0000000139764003 CR4: 0000000000770ef0PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <TASK> hci_read_local_codecs_sync net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c:4546 [inline] hci_init_stage_sync net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c:3441 [inline] hci_init4_sync net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c:4706 [inline] hci_init_sync net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c:4742 [inline] hci_dev_init_sync net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c:4912 [inline] hci_dev_open_sync+0x19a9/0x2d30 net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c:4994 hci_dev_do_open net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:483 [inline] hci_power_on+0x11e/0x560 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:1015 process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3267 [inline] process_scheduled_works+0x8ef/0x14f0 kernel/workqueue.c:3348 worker_thread+0x91f/0xe50 kernel/workqueue.c:3429 kthread+0x2cb/0x360 kernel/kthread.c:388 ret_from_fork+0x4d/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50255` to fix the vulnerability.
