		"title": "CVE-2024-26691 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: Fix circular locking dependency The rule inside kvm enforces thatthe vcpu->mutex is taken *inside* kvm->lock. The rule is violated by thepkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquires the kvm->lock while already holding thevcpu->mutex lock from kvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular lockingdependency altogether by protecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock,much like we already do for other forms of VM-scoped data.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26691` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-44-generic - 6.5.0-44.44~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-44-generic - 6.5.0-44.44~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-44-generic-64k - 6.5.0-44.44~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1023-aws - 6.5.0-1023.23~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-azure - 6.5.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-gcp - 6.5.0-1024.26~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-44-lowlatency - 6.5.0-44.44.1~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-44-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-44.44.1~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1026-oracle - 6.5.0-1026.26~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1026-oracle-64k - 6.5.0-1026.26~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1027-oem - 6.5.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1017-starfive - 6.5.0-1017.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1023-nvidia - 6.5.0-1023.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1023-nvidia-64k - 6.5.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required",
