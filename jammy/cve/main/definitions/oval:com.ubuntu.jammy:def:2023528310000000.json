		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cpu/hotplug: Don't offline the last non-isolated CPU If a system hasisolated CPUs via the \"isolcpus=\" command line parameter, then an attemptto offline the last housekeeping CPU will result in a WARN_ON() whenrebuilding the scheduler domains and a subsequent panic due to andunhandled empty CPU mas in partition_sched_domains_locked().cpuset_hotplug_workfn() rebuild_sched_domains_locked() ndoms =generate_sched_domains(&doms, &attr); cpumask_and(doms[0],top_cpuset.effective_cpus, housekeeping_cpumask(HK_FLAG_DOMAIN)); Thusresults in an empty CPU mask which triggers the warning and then thesubsequent crash: WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 80 at kernel/sched/topology.c:2366build_sched_domains+0x120c/0x1408 Call trace:build_sched_domains+0x120c/0x1408partition_sched_domains_locked+0x234/0x880rebuild_sched_domains_locked+0x37c/0x798 rebuild_sched_domains+0x30/0x58cpuset_hotplug_workfn+0x2a8/0x930 Unable to handle kernel paging request atvirtual address fffe80027ab37080 partition_sched_domains_locked+0x318/0x880rebuild_sched_domains_locked+0x37c/0x798 Aside of the resulting crash, itdoes not make any sense to offline the last last housekeeping CPU. Preventthis by masking out the non-housekeeping CPUs when selecting a target CPUfor initiating the CPU unplug operation via the work queue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52831` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1014-nvidia - 6.5.0-1014.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1014-nvidia-64k - 6.5.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required",
