		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/cma: Fix listener leak in rdma_cma_listen_on_all() failure Ifcma_listen_on_all() fails it leaves the per-device ID still on thelisten_list but the state is not set to RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND. When the cmidis eventually destroyed cma_cancel_listens() is not called due to the wrongstate, however the per-device IDs are still holding the refcount preventingthe ID from being destroyed, thus deadlocking: task:rping state:D stack: 0pid:19605 ppid: 47036 flags:0x00000084 Call Trace: __schedule+0x29a/0x780 ?free_unref_page_commit+0x9b/0x110 schedule+0x3c/0xa0schedule_timeout+0x215/0x2b0 ? __flush_work+0x19e/0x1e0wait_for_completion+0x8d/0xf0 _destroy_id+0x144/0x210 [rdma_cm]ucma_close_id+0x2b/0x40 [rdma_ucm] __destroy_id+0x93/0x2c0 [rdma_ucm] ?__xa_erase+0x4a/0xa0 ucma_destroy_id+0x9a/0x120 [rdma_ucm]ucma_write+0xb8/0x130 [rdma_ucm] vfs_write+0xb4/0x250 ksys_write+0xb5/0xd0? syscall_trace_enter.isra.19+0x123/0x190 do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9 Ensure that cma_listen_on_all()atomically unwinds its action under the lock during error.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47392` to fix the vulnerability.
