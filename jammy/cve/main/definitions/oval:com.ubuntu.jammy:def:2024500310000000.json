Although all perfmons are destroyed in `v3d_perfmon_close_file()`,the active performance monitor's pointer (`v3d->active_perfmon`) is stillretained.If `kmscube` is run again, the driver will attempt to stop the activeperformance monitor using the stale pointer in `v3d->active_perfmon`.However, this pointer is no longer valid because the previous process hasalready terminated, and all performance monitors associated with it havebeen destroyed and freed.To fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a givenprocess, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50031` to fix the vulnerability.
