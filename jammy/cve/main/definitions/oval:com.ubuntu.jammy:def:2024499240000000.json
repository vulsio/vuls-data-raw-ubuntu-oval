		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fbdev: pxafb: Fix possible use after free in pxafb_task()In the pxafb_probe function, it calls the pxafb_init_fbinfo function,after which &fbi->task is associated with pxafb_task. Moreover,within this pxafb_init_fbinfo function, the pxafb_blank functionwithin the &pxafb_ops struct is capable of scheduling work.If we remove the module which will call pxafb_remove to make cleanup,it will call unregister_framebuffer function which can calldo_unregister_framebuffer to free fbi->fb throughput_fb_info(fb_info), while the work mentioned above will be used.The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:CPU0                                                CPU1                                   | pxafb_taskpxafb_remove                       |unregister_framebuffer(info)       |do_unregister_framebuffer(fb_info) |put_fb_info(fb_info)               |// free fbi->fb                    | set_ctrlr_state(fbi, state)                                   | __pxafb_lcd_power(fbi, 0)                                   | fbi->lcd_power(on, &fbi->fb.var)                                   | //use fbi->fbFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceedingwith the cleanup in pxafb_remove.Note that only root user can remove the driver at runtime.",
