		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm, slub: avoid zeroing kmalloc redzoneSince commit 946fa0dbf2d8 (\"mm/slub: extend redzone check to extraallocated kmalloc space than requested\"), setting orig_size treatsthe wasted space (object_size - orig_size) as a redzone. However withinit_on_free=1 we clear the full object->size, including the redzone.Additionally we clear the object metadata, including the stored orig_size,making it zero, which makes check_object() treat the whole object as aredzone.These issues lead to the following BUG report with \"slub_debug=FUZinit_on_free=1\":[    0.000000]=============================================================================[    0.000000] BUG kmalloc-8 (Not tainted): kmalloc Redzone overwritten[    0.000000]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[    0.000000][    0.000000] 0xffff000010032858-0xffff00001003285f @offset=2136.
