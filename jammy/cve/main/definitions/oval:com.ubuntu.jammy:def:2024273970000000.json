		"title": "CVE-2024-27397 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set element timeout Add atimestamp field at the beginning of the transaction, store it in thenftables per-netns area. Update set backend .insert, .deactivate and syncgc path to use the timestamp, this avoids that an element expires whilecontrol plane transaction is still unfinished. .lookup and .update, whichare used from packet path, still use the current time to check if theelement has expired. And .get path and dump also since this runs locklessunder rcu read size lock. Then, there is async gc which also needs to checkthe current time since it runs asynchronously from a workqueue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27397` to fix the vulnerability.
