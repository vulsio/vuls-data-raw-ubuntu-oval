The timer callback, dl_task_timer,is supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,if enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,the reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.This patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_structreference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.",
