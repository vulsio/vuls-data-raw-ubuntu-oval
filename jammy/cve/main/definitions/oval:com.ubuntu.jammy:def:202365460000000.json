		"title": "CVE-2023-6546 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "A race condition was found in the GSM 0710 tty multiplexor in the Linuxkernel. This issue occurs when two threads execute the GSMIOC_SETCONF ioctlon the same tty file descriptor with the gsm line discipline enabled, andcan lead to a use-after-free problem on a struct gsm_dlci while restartingthe gsm mux. This could allow a local unprivileged user to escalate theirprivileges on the system.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-6546` to fix the vulnerability.
