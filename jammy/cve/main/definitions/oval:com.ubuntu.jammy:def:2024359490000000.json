		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:make sure that WRITTEN is set on all metadata blocks We previously wouldcall btrfs_check_leaf() if we had the check integrity code enabled, whichmeant that we could only run the extended leaf checks if we had WRITTEN seton the header flags. This leaves a gap in our checking, because we couldend up with corruption on disk where WRITTEN isn't set on the leaf, andthen the extended leaf checks don't get run which we rely on to validateall of the item pointers to make sure we don't access memory outside of theextent buffer. However, since 732fab95abe2 (\"btrfs: check-integrity: removeCONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY option\") we no longer callbtrfs_check_leaf() from btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty(), which means we only evercall it on blocks that are being written out, and thus have WRITTEN set, orthat are being read in, which should have WRITTEN set. Add checks to makesure we have WRITTEN set appropriately, and then make sure__btrfs_check_leaf() always does the item checking. This will protect usfrom file systems that have been corrupted and no longer have WRITTEN seton some of the blocks. This was hit on a crafted image tweaking the WRITTENbit and reported by KASAN as out-of-bound access in the eb accessors. Theexample is a dir item at the end of an eb.
