Later on when such pages are released byunpoison_memory(), the allocation tag counters will be decremented againand the following warning gets reported:[  113.930443][ T3282] ------------[ cut here ]------------[  113.931105][ T3282] alloc_tag was not set[  113.931576][ T3282] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3282 at./include/linux/alloc_tag.h:130 pgalloc_tag_sub.part.66+0x154/0x164[  113.932866][ T3282] Modules linked in: hwpoison_inject fuseip6t_rpfilter ip6t_REJECT nf_reject_ipv6 ipt_REJECT nf_reject_ipv4xt_conntrack ebtable_nat ebtable_broute ip6table_nat ip6table_man4[  113.941638][ T3282] CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 3282 Comm: madvise11 Kdump:loaded Tainted: G        W          6.11.0-rc4-dirty #18[  113.943003][ T3282] Tainted: [W]=WARN[  113.943453][ T3282] Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOSunknown 2/2/2022[  113.944378][ T3282] pstate: 40400005 (nZcv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT-SSBS BTYPE=--)[  113.945319][ T3282] pc : pgalloc_tag_sub.part.66+0x154/0x164[  113.946016][ T3282] lr : pgalloc_tag_sub.part.66+0x154/0x164[  113.946706][ T3282] sp : ffff800087093a10[  113.947197][ T3282] x29: ffff800087093a10 x28: ffff0000d7a9d400 x27:ffff80008249f0a0[  113.948165][ T3282] x26: 0000000000000000 x25: ffff80008249f2b0 x24:0000000000000000[  113.949134][ T3282] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 0000000000000001 x21:0000000000000000[  113.950597][ T3282] x20: ffff0000c08fcad8 x19: ffff80008251e000 x18:ffffffffffffffff[  113.952207][ T3282] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15:ffff800081746210[  113.953161][ T3282] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 205d323832335420 x12:5b5d353031313339[  113.954120][ T3282] x11: ffff800087093500 x10: 000000000000005d x9 :00000000ffffffd0[  113.955078][ T3282] x8 : 7f7f7f7f7f7f7f7f x7 : ffff80008236ba90 x6 :c0000000ffff7fff[  113.956036][ T3282] x5 : ffff000b34bf4dc8 x4 : ffff8000820aba90 x3 :0000000000000001[  113.956994][ T3282] x2 : ffff800ab320f000 x1 : 841d1e35ac932e00 x0 :0000000000000000[  113.957962][ T3282] Call trace:[  113.958350][ T3282]  pgalloc_tag_sub.part.66+0x154/0x164[  113.959000][ T3282]  pgalloc_tag_sub+0x14/0x1c[  113.959539][ T3282]  free_unref_page+0xf4/0x4b8[  113.960096][ T3282]  __folio_put+0xd4/0x120[  113.960614][ T3282]  folio_put+0x24/0x50[  113.961103][ T3282]  unpoison_memory+0x4f0/0x5b0[  113.961678][ T3282]  hwpoison_unpoison+0x30/0x48 [hwpoison_inject][  113.962436][ T3282]  simple_attr_write_xsigned.isra.34+0xec/0x1cc[  113.963183][ T3282]  simple_attr_write+0x38/0x48[  113.963750][ T3282]  debugfs_attr_write+0x54/0x80[  113.964330][ T3282]  full_proxy_write+0x68/0x98[  113.964880][ T3282]  vfs_write+0xdc/0x4d0[  113.965372][ T3282]  ksys_write+0x78/0x100[  113.965875][ T3282]  __arm64_sys_write+0x24/0x30[  113.966440][ T3282]  invoke_syscall+0x7c/0x104[  113.966984][ T3282]  el0_svc_common.constprop.1+0x88/0x104[  113.967652][ T3282]  do_el0_svc+0x2c/0x38[  113.968893][ T3282]  el0_svc+0x3c/0x1b8[  113.969379][ T3282]  el0t_64_sync_handler+0x98/0xbc[  113.969980][ T3282]  el0t_64_sync+0x19c/0x1a0[  113.970511][ T3282] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---To fix this, clear the page tag reference after the page got isolatedand accounted for.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46790` to fix the vulnerability.
