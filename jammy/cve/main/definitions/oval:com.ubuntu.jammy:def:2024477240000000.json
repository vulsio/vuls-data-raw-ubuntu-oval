		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath11k: use work queue to process beacon tx eventCommit 3a415daa3e8b (\"wifi: ath11k: add P2P IE in beacon template\")from Feb 28, 2024 (linux-next), leads to the following Smatch staticchecker warning:drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath11k/wmi.c:1742 ath11k_wmi_p2p_go_bcn_ie()warn: sleeping in atomic contextThe reason is that ath11k_bcn_tx_status_event() will directly call mightsleep function ath11k_wmi_cmd_send() during RCU read-side criticalsections. The call trace is like:ath11k_bcn_tx_status_event()-> rcu_read_lock()-> ath11k_mac_bcn_tx_event()\t-> ath11k_mac_setup_bcn_tmpl()\t……\t\t-> ath11k_wmi_bcn_tmpl()\t\t\t-> ath11k_wmi_cmd_send()-> rcu_read_unlock()Commit 886433a98425 (\"ath11k: add support for BSS color change\") added theath11k_mac_bcn_tx_event(), commit 01e782c89108 (\"ath11k: fix warningof RCU usage for ath11k_mac_get_arvif_by_vdev_id()\") added the RCU lockto avoid warning but also introduced this BUG.Use work queue to avoid directly calling ath11k_mac_bcn_tx_event()during RCU critical sections. No need to worry about the deletion of vifbecause cancel_work_sync() will drop the work if it doesn't start orblock vif deletion until the running work is done.Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.0 PCIWLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.30",
