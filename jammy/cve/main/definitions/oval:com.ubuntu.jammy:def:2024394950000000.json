		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:greybus: Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to racecondition.In gb_interface_create, &intf->mode_switch_completion is bound withgb_interface_mode_switch_work. Then it will be started bygb_interface_request_mode_switch. Here is the relevant code.if (!queue_work(system_long_wq, &intf->mode_switch_work)) {\t...}If we call gb_interface_release to make cleanup, there may be anunfinished work. This function will call kfree to free the object\"intf\". However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled torun after kfree, it may cause use-after-free error asgb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object \"intf\".The possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows:CPU0                            CPU1                            |   gb_interface_create                            |   gb_interface_request_mode_switchgb_interface_release        |kfree(intf) (free)          |                            |   gb_interface_mode_switch_work                            |   mutex_lock(&intf->mutex) (use)Fix it by canceling the work before kfree.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39495` to fix the vulnerability.
