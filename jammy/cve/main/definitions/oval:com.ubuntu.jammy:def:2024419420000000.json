		"description": "JupyterHub is software that allows one to create a multi-user server forJupyter notebooks. Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is grantedthe `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by makingthemselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively small in that`admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted totrusted users.In effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is notintended. Note that the change here only prevents escalation to thebuilt-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It doesnot prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselvesor other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional.Versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue.",
