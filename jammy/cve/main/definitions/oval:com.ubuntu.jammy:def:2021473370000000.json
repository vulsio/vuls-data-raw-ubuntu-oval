		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:core: Fix bad pointer dereference when ehandler kthread is invalid Commit66a834d09293 (\"scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()\")changed the allocation logic to call put_device() to perform host cleanupwith the assumption that IDA removal and stopping the kthread wouldproperly be performed in scsi_host_dev_release(). However, in the unlikelycase that the error handler thread fails to spawn, shost->ehandler is setto ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM). The error handler cleanup code inscsi_host_dev_release() will call kthread_stop() if shost->ehandler != NULLwhich will always be the case whether the kthread was successfully spawnedor not. In the case that it failed to spawn this has the nasty side effectof trying to dereference an invalid pointer when kthread_stop() is called.The following splat provides an example of this behavior in the wild: scsihost11: error handler thread failed to spawn, error = -4 Kernel attemptedto read user page (10c) - exploit attempt?
