		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: Fix increasing MSI-X on VFIncreasing MSI-X value on a VF leads to invalid memory operations. Thisis caused by not reallocating some arrays.Reproducer:  modprobe ice  echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$PF_PCI/sriov_drivers_autoprobe  echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$PF_PCI/sriov_numvfs  echo 17 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$VF0_PCI/sriov_vf_msix_countDefault MSI-X is 16, so 17 and above triggers this issue.KASAN reports:  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ice_vsi_alloc_ring_stats+0x38d/0x4b0[ice]  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8888b937d180 by task bash/28433  (...)

Thiscauses the required arrays to be reallocated taking the new queue countinto account (ice_vsi_realloc_stat_arrays()). Set req_txq and req_rxqbefore ice_vsi_rebuild(), so that realloc uses the newly set queuecount.Additionally, ice_vsi_rebuild() does not remove VSI filters(ice_fltr_remove_all()), so ice_vf_init_host_cfg() is no longernecessary.",
