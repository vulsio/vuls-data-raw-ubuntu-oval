		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/exynos: hdmi: report safe 640x480 mode as a fallback when no EDID foundWhen reading EDID fails and driver reports no modes available, the DRMcore adds an artificial 1024x786 mode to the connector. Unfortunatelysome variants of the Exynos HDMI (like the one in Exynos4 SoCs) are notable to drive such mode, so report a safe 640x480 mode instead of nothingin case of the EDID reading failure.This fixes the following issue observed on Trats2 board since commit13d5b040363c (\"drm/exynos: do not return negative values from.get_modes()\"):[drm] Exynos DRM: using 11c00000.fimd device for DMA mapping operationsexynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 11c00000.fimd (ops fimd_component_ops)exynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 12c10000.mixer (ops mixer_component_ops)exynos-dsi 11c80000.dsi: [drm:samsung_dsim_host_attach] Attached s6e8aa0device (lanes:4 bpp:24 mode-flags:0x10b)exynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 11c80000.dsi (ops exynos_dsi_component_ops)exynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 12d00000.hdmi (ops hdmi_component_ops)[drm] Initialized exynos 1.1.0 20180330 for exynos-drm on minor 1exynos-hdmi 12d00000.hdmi: [drm:hdmiphy_enable.part.0] *ERROR* PLL couldnot reach steady statepanel-samsung-s6e8aa0 11c80000.dsi.0: ID: 0xa2, 0x20, 0x8cexynos-mixer 12c10000.mixer: timeout waiting for VSYNC------------[ cut here ]------------WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 11 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic_helper.c:1682drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x2b0/0x2b8[CRTC:70:crtc-1] vblank wait timed outModules linked in:CPU: 1 PID: 11 Comm: kworker/u16:0 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc5-next-20240424#14913Hardware name: Samsung Exynos (Flattened Device Tree)Workqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_funcCall trace: unwind_backtrace from show_stack+0x10/0x14 show_stack from dump_stack_lvl+0x68/0x88 dump_stack_lvl from __warn+0x7c/0x1c4 __warn from warn_slowpath_fmt+0x11c/0x1a8 warn_slowpath_fmt fromdrm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x2b0/0x2b8 drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0 fromdrm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm+0x7c/0x8c drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm from commit_tail+0x9c/0x184 commit_tail from drm_atomic_helper_commit+0x168/0x190 drm_atomic_helper_commit from drm_atomic_commit+0xb4/0xe0 drm_atomic_commit from drm_client_modeset_commit_atomic+0x23c/0x27c drm_client_modeset_commit_atomic fromdrm_client_modeset_commit_locked+0x60/0x1cc drm_client_modeset_commit_locked from drm_client_modeset_commit+0x24/0x40 drm_client_modeset_commit from__drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked+0x9c/0xc4 __drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked fromdrm_fb_helper_set_par+0x2c/0x3c drm_fb_helper_set_par from fbcon_init+0x3d8/0x550 fbcon_init from visual_init+0xc0/0x108 visual_init from do_bind_con_driver+0x1b8/0x3a4 do_bind_con_driver from do_take_over_console+0x140/0x1ec do_take_over_console from do_fbcon_takeover+0x70/0xd0 do_fbcon_takeover from fbcon_fb_registered+0x19c/0x1ac fbcon_fb_registered from register_framebuffer+0x190/0x21c register_framebuffer from__drm_fb_helper_initial_config_and_unlock+0x350/0x574 __drm_fb_helper_initial_config_and_unlock fromexynos_drm_fbdev_client_hotplug+0x6c/0xb0 exynos_drm_fbdev_client_hotplug from drm_client_register+0x58/0x94 drm_client_register from exynos_drm_bind+0x160/0x190 exynos_drm_bind from try_to_bring_up_aggregate_device+0x200/0x2d8 try_to_bring_up_aggregate_device from __component_add+0xb0/0x170 __component_add from mixer_probe+0x74/0xcc mixer_probe from platform_probe+0x5c/0xb8 platform_probe from really_probe+0xe0/0x3d8 really_probe from __driver_probe_device+0x9c/0x1e4 __driver_probe_device from driver_probe_device+0x30/0xc0 driver_probe_device from __device_attach_driver+0xa8/0x120 __device_attach_driver from bus_for_each_drv+0x80/0xcc bus_for_each_drv from __device_attach+0xac/0x1fc __device_attach from bus_probe_device+0x8c/0x90 bus_probe_device from deferred_probe_work_func+0---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40916` to fix the vulnerability.
