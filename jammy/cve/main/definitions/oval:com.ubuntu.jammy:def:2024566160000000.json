		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/dp_mst: Fix MST sideband message body length checkFix the MST sideband message body length check, which must be at least 1byte accounting for the message body CRC (aka message data CRC) at theend of the message.This fixes a case where an MST branch device returns a header with acorrect header CRC (indicating a correctly received body length), withthe body length being incorrectly set to 0. This will later lead to amemory corruption in drm_dp_sideband_append_payload() and the followingerrors in dmesg:   UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds indrivers/gpu/drm/display/drm_dp_mst_topology.c:786:25   index -1 is out of range for type 'u8 [48]'   Call Trace:    drm_dp_sideband_append_payload+0x33d/0x350 [drm_display_helper]    drm_dp_get_one_sb_msg+0x3ce/0x5f0 [drm_display_helper]    drm_dp_mst_hpd_irq_handle_event+0xc8/0x1580 [drm_display_helper]   memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 18446744073709551615) ofsingle field \"&msg->msg[msg->curlen]\" atdrivers/gpu/drm/display/drm_dp_mst_topology.c:791 (size 256)   Call Trace:    drm_dp_sideband_append_payload+0x324/0x350 [drm_display_helper]    drm_dp_get_one_sb_msg+0x3ce/0x5f0 [drm_display_helper]    drm_dp_mst_hpd_irq_handle_event+0xc8/0x1580 [drm_display_helper]",
