		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: clear uffd-wp PTE/PMD state on mremap()When mremap()ing a memory region previously registered with userfaultfd aswrite-protected but without UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP, an inconsistency inflag clearing leads to a mismatch between the vma flags (which haveuffd-wp cleared) and the pte/pmd flags (which do not have uffd-wpcleared).  This mismatch causes a subsequent mprotect(PROT_WRITE) totrigger a warning in page_table_check_pte_flags() due to setting the pteto writable while uffd-wp is still set.Fix this by always explicitly clearing the uffd-wp pte/pmd flags on anysuch mremap() so that the values are consistent with the existing clearingof VM_UFFD_WP.  Be careful to clear the logical flag regardless of itsphysical form; a PTE bit, a swap PTE bit, or a PTE marker.  Cover PTE,huge PMD and hugetlb paths.",
