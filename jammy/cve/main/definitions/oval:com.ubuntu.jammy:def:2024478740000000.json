		"description": "Starlette is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)framework/toolkit. Prior to version 0.40.0, Starlette treats`multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as text form fields andbuffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows an attackerto upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow downsignificantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, andalso consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping andgrinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOMerror. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to rendera service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits areenforced by a reverse proxy in front of Starlette. This Denial of service(DoS) vulnerability affects all applications built with Starlette (orFastAPI) accepting form requests. Verison 0.40.0 fixes this issue.",
