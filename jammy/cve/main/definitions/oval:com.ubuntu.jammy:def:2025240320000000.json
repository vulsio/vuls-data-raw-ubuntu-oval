		"description": "PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificatebased user login. Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none(the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capableof logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token withthe user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to theattacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then theattacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to*not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commitcommi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versionsstarting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in`pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.",
