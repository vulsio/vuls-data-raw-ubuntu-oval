		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:cachestat: fix two shmem bugs When cachestat on shmem races with swappingand invalidation, there are two possible bugs: 1) A swapin error can haveresulted in a poisoned swap entry in the shmem inode's xarray. Callingget_shadow_from_swap_cache() on it will result in an out-of-bounds accessto swapper_spaces[]. Validate the entry with non_swap_entry() before goingfurther. 2) When we find a valid swap entry in the shmem's inode, theshadow entry in the swapcache might not exist yet: swap IO is still inprogress and we're before __remove_mapping; swapin, invalidation, orswapoff have removed the shadow from swapcache after we saw the shmem swapentry. This will send a NULL to workingset_test_recent(). The latter purelyoperates on pointer bits, so it won't crash - node 0, memcg ID 0, evictiontimestamp 0, etc. are all valid inputs - but it's a bogus test. In theorythat could result in a false \"recently evicted\" count. Such a falsepositive wouldn't be the end of the world. But for code clarity and(future) robustness, be explicit about this case.
