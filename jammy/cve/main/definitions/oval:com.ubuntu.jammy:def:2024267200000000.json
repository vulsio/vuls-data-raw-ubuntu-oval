		"title": "CVE-2024-26720 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again(struct dirty_throttle_control *)->thresh is an unsigned long, but ispassed as the u32 divisor argument to div_u64(). On architectures whereunsigned long is 64 bytes, the argument will be implicitly truncated. Usediv64_u64() instead of div_u64() so that the value used in the \"is this asafe division\" check is the same as the divisor. Also, remove redundantcast of the numerator to u64, as that should happen implicitly. This wouldbe difficult to exploit in memcg domain, given the ratio-based arithmeticdomain_drity_limits() uses, but is much easier in global writeback domainwith a BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT-backing device, using e.g.vm.dirty_bytes=(1<<32)*PAGE_SIZE so that dtc->thresh == (1<<32)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26720` to fix the vulnerability.
