		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/smc: Fix possible access to freed memory in link clear After modifyingthe QP to the Error state, all RX WR would be completed with WC inIB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR status. Current implementation does not wait for it isdone, but destroy the QP and free the link group directly. So there is arisk that accessing the freed memory in tasklet context.
