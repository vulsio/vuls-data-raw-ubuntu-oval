		"title": "CVE-2024-47537 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handlingcomponents. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to bystream->samples to accommodate stream->n_samples + samples_count elementsof type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from theinput file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integeroverflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocatememory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended.Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements andattempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceedingthe actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. Thisvulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47537` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngstreamer1.0-gtk3 - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.3\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-good - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.3\ngstreamer1.0-pulseaudio - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.3\ngstreamer1.0-qt5 - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.3\nlibgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-0 - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
