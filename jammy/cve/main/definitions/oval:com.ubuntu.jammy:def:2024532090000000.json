		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bnxt_en: Fix receive ring space parameters when XDP is activeThe MTU setting at the time an XDP multi-buffer is attacheddetermines whether the aggregation ring will be used and therx_skb_func handler.  This is done in bnxt_set_rx_skb_mode().If the MTU is later changed, the aggregation ring setting may needto be changed and it may become out-of-sync with the settingsinitially done in bnxt_set_rx_skb_mode().  This may result inrandom memory corruption and crashes as the HW may DMA data largerthan the allocated buffer size, such as:BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000003c0PGD 0 P4D 0Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTICPU: 17 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/17 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G S         OE6.1.0-226bf9805506 #1Hardware name: Wiwynn Delta Lake PVT BZA.02601.0150/Delta Lake-Class1, BIOSF0E_3A12 08/26/2021RIP: 0010:bnxt_rx_pkt+0xe97/0x1ae0 [bnxt_en]Code: 8b 95 70 ff ff ff 4c 8b 9d 48 ff ff ff 66 41 89 87 b4 00 00 00 e9 0bf7 ff ff 0f b7 43 0a 49 8b 95 a8 04 00 00 25 ff 0f 00 00 <0f> b7 14 42 48c1 e2 06 49 03 95 a0 04 00 00 0f b6 42 33fRSP: 0018:ffffa19f40cc0d18 EFLAGS: 00010202RAX: 00000000000001e0 RBX: ffff8e2c805c6100 RCX: 00000000000007ffRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffff8e2c271ab990 RDI: ffff8e2c84f12380RBP: ffffa19f40cc0e48 R08: 000000000001000d R09: 974ea2fcddfa4cbfR10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffa19f40cc0ff8 R12: ffff8e2c94b58980R13: ffff8e2c952d6600 R14: 0000000000000016 R15: ffff8e2c271ab990FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8e3b3f840000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00000000000003c0 CR3: 0000000e8580a004 CR4: 00000000007706e0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <IRQ> __bnxt_poll_work+0x1c2/0x3e0 [bnxt_en]To address the issue, we now call bnxt_set_rx_skb_mode() withinbnxt_change_mtu() to properly set the AGG rings configuration andupdate rx_skb_func based on the new MTU value.Additionally, BNXT_FLAG_NO_AGG_RINGS is cleared at the beginning ofbnxt_set_rx_skb_mode() to make sure it gets set or cleared based onthe current MTU.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53209` to fix the vulnerability.
