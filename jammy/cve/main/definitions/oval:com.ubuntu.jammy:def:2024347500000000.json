		"description": "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled ResourceConsumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headerscorrectly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turnled to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connectionsto remain open which should have been closed.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90,which fixes the issue.",
