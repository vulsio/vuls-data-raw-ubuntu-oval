		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:watch_queue: Fix filter limit checkIn watch_queue_set_filter(), there are a couple of places where we checkthat the filter type value does not exceed what the type_filter bitmapcan hold.  One place calculates the number of bits by:   if (tf[i].type >= sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * 8)which is fine, but the second does:   if (tf[i].type >= sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * BITS_PER_LONG)which is not.  This can lead to a couple of out-of-bounds writes due toa too-large type: (1) __set_bit() on wfilter->type_filter (2) Writing more elements in wfilter->filters[] than we allocated.Fix this by just using the proper WATCH_TYPE__NR instead, which is thenumber of types we actually know about.The bug may cause an oops looking something like:  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in watch_queue_set_filter+0x659/0x740  Write of size 4 at addr ffff88800d2c66bc by task watch_queue_oob/611  ...
