		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/radeon: add a force flush to delay work when radeon Although radeoncard fence and wait for gpu to finish processing current batch rings, thereis still a corner case that radeon lockup work queue may not be fullyflushed, and meanwhile the radeon_suspend_kms() function has calledpci_set_power_state() to put device in D3hot state. Per PCI spec rev 4.0 on5.3.1.4.1 D3hot State. > Configuration and Message requests are the onlyTLPs accepted by a Function in > the D3hot state.
