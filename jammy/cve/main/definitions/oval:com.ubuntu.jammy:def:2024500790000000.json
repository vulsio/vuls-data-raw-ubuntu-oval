		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/sqpoll: ensure task state is TASK_RUNNING when running task_workWhen the sqpoll is exiting and cancels pending work items, it may needto run task_work. If this happens from within io_uring_cancel_generic(),then it may be under waiting for the io_uring_task waitqueue. Thisresults in the below splat from the scheduler, as the ring mutex may beattempted grabbed while in a TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state.Ensure that the task state is set appropriately for that, just like whatis done for the other cases in io_run_task_work().do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1 set at[<0000000029387fd2>] prepare_to_wait+0x88/0x2fcWARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 59939 at kernel/sched/core.c:8561__might_sleep+0xf4/0x140Modules linked in:CPU: 6 UID: 0 PID: 59939 Comm: iou-sqp-59938 Not tainted6.12.0-rc3-00113-g8d020023b155 #7456Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)pstate: 61400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO +DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)pc : __might_sleep+0xf4/0x140lr : __might_sleep+0xf4/0x140sp : ffff80008c5e7830x29: ffff80008c5e7830 x28: ffff0000d93088c0 x27: ffff60001c2d7230x26: dfff800000000000 x25: ffff0000e16b9180 x24: ffff80008c5e7a50x23: 1ffff000118bcf4a x22: ffff0000e16b9180 x21: ffff0000e16b9180x20: 000000000000011b x19: ffff80008310fac0 x18: 1ffff000118bcd90x17: 30303c5b20746120 x16: 74657320313d6574 x15: 0720072007200720x14: 0720072007200720 x13: 0720072007200720 x12: ffff600036c64f0bx11: 1fffe00036c64f0a x10: ffff600036c64f0a x9 : dfff800000000000x8 : 00009fffc939b0f6 x7 : ffff0001b6327853 x6 : 0000000000000001x5 : ffff0001b6327850 x4 : ffff600036c64f0b x3 : ffff8000803c35bcx2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : ffff0000e16b9180Call trace: __might_sleep+0xf4/0x140 mutex_lock+0x84/0x124 io_handle_tw_list+0xf4/0x260 tctx_task_work_run+0x94/0x340 io_run_task_work+0x1ec/0x3c0 io_uring_cancel_generic+0x364/0x524 io_sq_thread+0x820/0x124c ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50079` to fix the vulnerability.
