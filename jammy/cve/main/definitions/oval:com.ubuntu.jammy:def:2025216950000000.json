		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: dell-uart-backlight: fix serdev raceThe dell_uart_bl_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). Thisordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller'sreceive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid whenSERPORT_ACTIVE is set.This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1(\"platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition\") wheredevm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing thedevice.Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port viadevm_serdev_device_open().Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.",
