		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: igc:avoid returning frame twice in XDP_REDIRECT When a frame can not betransmitted in XDP_REDIRECT (e.g. due to a full queue), it is necessary tofree it by calling xdp_return_frame_rx_napi. However, this is theresponsibility of the caller of the ndo_xdp_xmit (see for examplebq_xmit_all in kernel/bpf/devmap.c) and thus calling it inside igc_xdp_xmit(which is the ndo_xdp_xmit of the igc driver) as well will lead to memorycorruption. In fact, bq_xmit_all expects that it can return all framesafter the last successfully transmitted one. Therefore, break for the firstnot transmitted frame, but do not call xdp_return_frame_rx_napi inigc_xdp_xmit. This is equally implemented in other Intel drivers such asthe igb. There are two alternatives to this that were rejected: 1. Returnnum_frames as all the frames would have been transmitted and release theminside igc_xdp_xmit. While it might work technically, it is not what thereturn value is meant to represent (i.e. the number of SUCCESSFULLYtransmitted packets). 2. Rework kernel/bpf/devmap.c and all drivers tosupport non-consecutively dropped packets. Besides being complex, it likelyhas a negative performance impact without a significant gain since it isanyway unlikely that the next frame can be transmitted if the previous onewas dropped. The memory corruption can be reproduced with the followingscript which leads to a kernel panic after a few seconds. It basicallygenerates more traffic than a i225 NIC can transmit and pushes it viaXDP_REDIRECT from a virtual interface to the physical interface whereframes get dropped. #!/bin/bash INTERFACE=enp4s0 INTERFACE_IDX=`cat/sys/class/net/$INTERFACE/ifindex` sudo ip link add dev veth1 type vethpeer name veth2 sudo ip link set up $INTERFACE sudo ip link set up veth1sudo ip link set up veth2 cat << EOF > redirect.bpf.c SEC(\"prog\") intredirect(struct xdp_md *ctx) { return bpf_redirect($INTERFACE_IDX, 0); }char _license[] SEC(\"license\") = \"GPL\"; EOF clang -O2 -g -Wall -target bpf-c redirect.bpf.c -o redirect.bpf.o sudo ip link set veth2 xdp objredirect.bpf.o cat << EOF > pass.bpf.c SEC(\"prog\") int pass(struct xdp_md*ctx) { return XDP_PASS; } char _license[] SEC(\"license\") = \"GPL\"; EOFclang -O2 -g -Wall -target bpf -c pass.bpf.c -o pass.bpf.o sudo ip link set$INTERFACE xdp obj pass.bpf.o cat << EOF > trafgen.cfg { /* Ethernet Header*/ 0xe8, 0x6a, 0x64, 0x41, 0xbf, 0x46, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,const16(ETH_P_IP), /* IPv4 Header */ 0b01000101, 0, # IPv4 version, IHL,TOS const16(1028), # IPv4 total length (UDP length + 20 bytes (IP header))const16(2), # IPv4 ident 0b01000000, 0, # IPv4 flags, fragmentation off 64,# IPv4 TTL 17, # Protocol UDP csumip(14, 33), # IPv4 checksum /* UDP Header*/ 10, 0, 1, 1, # IP Src - adapt as needed 10, 0, 1, 2, # IP Dest - adaptas needed const16(6666), # UDP Src Port const16(6666), # UDP Dest Portconst16(1008), # UDP length (UDP header 8 bytes + payload length)csumudp(14, 34), # UDP checksum /* Payload */ fill('W', 1000), } EOF sudotrafgen -i trafgen.cfg -b3000MB -o veth1 --cpp",
