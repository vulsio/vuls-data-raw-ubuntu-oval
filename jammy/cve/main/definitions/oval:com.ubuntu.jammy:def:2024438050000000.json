		"description": "jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproduciblecomputing, based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. This vulnerabilitydepends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdowncells, or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature. A malicious usercan access any data that the attacked user has access to as well as performarbitrary requests acting as the attacked user. JupyterLab v3.6.8, v4.2.5and Jupyter Notebook v7.2.2 have been patched to resolve this issue. Usersare advised to upgrade. There is no workaround for the underlying DOMClobbering susceptibility. However, select plugins can be disabled ondeployments which cannot update in a timely fashion to minimise the risk.These are: 1. `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin` - users will looseability to preview mathematical equations. 2.`@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability toopen Markdown previews. 3. `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (ifinstalled with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package) - an older versionof the mathjax plugin for JupyterLab 4.x. To disable these extensions run:```jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin&& jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin &&jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin ``` inbash.",
