Now the sii902x bridge is ready from DRM'sperspective. - sii902x calls sii902x_audio_codec_init() andplatform_device_register_data() - The registration of the audio platformdevice causes probing of the deferred devices. - tidss probes, whicheventually causes sii902x_bridge_get_edid() to be called. -sii902x_bridge_get_edid() tries to use the i2c to read the edid. However,the sii902x driver has not set up the i2c part yet, leading to the crash.Fix this by moving the drm_bridge_add() to the end of the sii902x_init(),which is also at the very end of sii902x_probe().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26607` to fix the vulnerability.
