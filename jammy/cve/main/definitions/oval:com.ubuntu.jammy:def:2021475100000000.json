For zoned btrfs, we re-dirty afreed tree node to ensure btrfs can write the region and does not leave ahole on write on a zoned device. The current code fails to re-dirty a nodewhen the tree-log tree's depth is greater or equal to 2. That leads to atransaction abort with -EAGAIN. Fix the issue by properly re-dirtying anode on walking up the tree.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47510` to fix the vulnerability.
