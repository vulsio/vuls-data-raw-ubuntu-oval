		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/core: Disable page allocation in task_tick_mm_cid()With KASAN and PREEMPT_RT enabled, calling task_work_add() intask_tick_mm_cid() may cause the following splat.[   63.696416] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context atkernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48[   63.696416] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 610,name: modprobe[   63.696416] preempt_count: 10001, expected: 0[   63.696416] RCU nest depth: 1, expected: 1This problem is caused by the following call trace.  sched_tick() [ acquire rq->__lock ]   -> task_tick_mm_cid()    -> task_work_add()     -> __kasan_record_aux_stack()      -> kasan_save_stack()       -> stack_depot_save_flags()        -> alloc_pages_mpol_noprof()         -> __alloc_pages_noprof()\t  -> get_page_from_freelist()\t   -> rmqueue()\t    -> rmqueue_pcplist()\t     -> __rmqueue_pcplist()\t      -> rmqueue_bulk()\t       -> rt_spin_lock()The rq lock is a raw_spinlock_t. We can't sleep while holdingit. IOW, we can't call alloc_pages() in stack_depot_save_flags().The task_tick_mm_cid() function with its task_work_add() call wasintroduced by commit 223baf9d17f2 (\"sched: Fix performance regressionintroduced by mm_cid\") in v6.4 kernel.Fortunately, there is a kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() variant thatcalls stack_depot_save_flags() while not allowing it to allocatenew pages.  To allow task_tick_mm_cid() to use task_work withoutpage allocation, a new TWAF_NO_ALLOC flag is added to enable callingkasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() instead of kasan_record_aux_stack()if set. The task_tick_mm_cid() function is modified to add this new flag.The possible downside is the missing stack trace in a KASAN report dueto new page allocation required when task_work_add_noallloc() is calledwhich should be rare.",
