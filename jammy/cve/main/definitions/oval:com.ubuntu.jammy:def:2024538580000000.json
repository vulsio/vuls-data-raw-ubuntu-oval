		"description": "The gh cli is GitHubâ€™s official command line tool. A security vulnerabilityhas been identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokenswhen cloning repositories containing `git` submodules hosted outside ofGitHub.com and ghe.com. This vulnerability stems from several `gh` commandsused to clone a repository with submodules from a non-GitHub host including`gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout`. These GitHub CLIcommands invoke git with instructions to retrieve authentication tokensusing the `credential.helper` configuration variable for any hostencountered. Prior to version `2.63.0`, hosts other than GitHub.com andghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokenssourced from the following environment variables before falling back tohost-specific tokens stored within system-specific secured storage: 1.`GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, 2. `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` and 3. `GITHUB_TOKEN`when the `CODESPACES` environment variable is set. The result being `git`sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules. In version `2.63.0`,these GitHub CLI commands will limit the hosts for which `gh` acts as acredential helper to source authentication tokens. Additionally,`GITHUB_TOKEN` will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com. Users areadvised to upgrade. Additionally users are advised to revoke authenticationtokens used with the GitHub CLI and to review their personal security logand any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account orenterprise",
