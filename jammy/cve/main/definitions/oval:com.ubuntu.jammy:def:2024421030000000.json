		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix adding block group to a reclaim list and the unused list duringreclaimThere is a potential parallel list adding for retrying inbtrfs_reclaim_bgs_work and adding to the unused list. Since the blockgroup is removed from the reclaim list and it is on a relocation work,it can be added into the unused list in parallel. When that happens,adding it to the reclaim list will corrupt the list head and triggerlist corruption like below.Fix it by taking fs_info->unused_bgs_lock.

Since the block group was in the unused list, the used bytesshould be 0 when it was added to the unused list. Then, it checksblock_group->{used,reserved,pinned} are still 0 under theblock_group->lock. So, they should be still eligible for the unused list,not the reclaim list.The reason it is safe there it's because because we're holdingspace_info->groups_sem in write mode.That means no other task can allocate from the block group, so while weare at deleted_unused_bgs() it's not possible for other tasks toallocate and deallocate extents from the block group, so it can't beadded to the unused list or the reclaim list by anyone else.The bug can be reproduced by btrfs/166 after a few rounds. In practicethis can be hit when relocation cannot find more chunk space and endswith ENOSPC.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42103` to fix the vulnerability.
