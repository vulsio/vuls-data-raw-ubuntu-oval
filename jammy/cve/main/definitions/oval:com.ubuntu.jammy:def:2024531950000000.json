		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: arm64: Get rid of userspace_irqchip_in_useImproper use of userspace_irqchip_in_use led to syzbot hitting thefollowing WARN_ON() in kvm_timer_update_irq():WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3281 at arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c:459kvm_timer_update_irq+0x21c/0x394Call trace:  kvm_timer_update_irq+0x21c/0x394 arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c:459  kvm_timer_vcpu_reset+0x158/0x684 arch/arm64/kvm/arch_timer.c:968  kvm_reset_vcpu+0x3b4/0x560 arch/arm64/kvm/reset.c:264  kvm_vcpu_set_target arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c:1553 [inline]  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_vcpu_init arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c:1573 [inline]  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl+0x112c/0x1b3c arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c:1695  kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x4ec/0xf74 virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:4658  vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]  __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]  __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:893 [inline]  __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x108/0x184 fs/ioctl.c:893  __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:35 [inline]  invoke_syscall+0x78/0x1b8 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:49  el0_svc_common+0xe8/0x1b0 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:132  do_el0_svc+0x40/0x50 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:151  el0_svc+0x54/0x14c arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:712  el0t_64_sync_handler+0x84/0xfc arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:730  el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:598The following sequence led to the scenario: - Userspace creates a VM and a vCPU. - The vCPU is initialized with KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 during   KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT. - Without any other setup, such as vGIC or vPMU, userspace issues   KVM_RUN on the vCPU. Since the vPMU is requested, but not setup,   kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() fails in kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change().   As a result, KVM_RUN returns after enabling the timer, but before   incrementing 'userspace_irqchip_in_use':   kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()       ret = kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable()           if (!vcpu->arch.pmu.created)               return -EINVAL;       if (ret)           return ret;       [...]       if (!irqchip_in_kernel(kvm))           static_branch_inc(&userspace_irqchip_in_use); - Userspace ignores the error and issues KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT again.   Since the timer is already enabled, control moves through the   following flow, ultimately hitting the WARN_ON():   kvm_timer_vcpu_reset()       if (timer->enabled)          kvm_timer_update_irq()              if (!userspace_irqchip())                  ret = kvm_vgic_inject_irq()                      ret = vgic_lazy_init()                          if (unlikely(!vgic_initialized(kvm)))                              if (kvm->arch.vgic.vgic_model !=                                  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2)                                      return -EBUSY;                  WARN_ON(ret);Theoretically, since userspace_irqchip_in_use's functionality can besimply replaced by '!irqchip_in_kernel()', get rid of the static keyto avoid the mismanagement, which also helps with the syzbot issue.",
