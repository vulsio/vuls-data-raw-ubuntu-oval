		"Title": "CVE-2021-26933 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen 4.9 through 4.14.x. On Arm, a guest isallowed to control whether memory accesses are bypassing the cache. Thismeans that Xen needs to ensure that all writes (such as the ones duringscrubbing) have reached the memory before handing over the page to a guest.Unfortunately, the operation to clean the cache is happening beforechecking if the page was scrubbed. Therefore there is no guarantee when allthe writes will reach the memory.",
