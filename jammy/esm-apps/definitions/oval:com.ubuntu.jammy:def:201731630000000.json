		"Title": "CVE-2017-3163 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull indexfiles from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a filename. However, Solr before 5.5.4 and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not validate thefile name, hence it was possible to craft a special request involving pathtraversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed.Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/orauthentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and userswould gain direct HTTP access.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-3163` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblucene3-contrib-java - 3.6.2+dfsg-11\nliblucene3-java - 3.6.2+dfsg-11\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
