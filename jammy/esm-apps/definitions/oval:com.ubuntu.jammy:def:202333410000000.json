    "Title": "CVE-2023-3341 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "The code that processes control channel messages sent to `named` calls certain functions recursively during packet parsing. Recursion depth is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available stack memory, causing `named` to terminate unexpectedly. Since each incoming control channel message is fully parsed before its contents are authenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the attacker to hold a valid RNDC key; only network access to the control channel's configured TCP port is necessary. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.2.0 through 9.16.43, 9.18.0 through 9.18.18, 9.19.0 through 9.19.16, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.16.43-S1, and 9.18.0-S1 through 9.18.18-S1.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3341` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbind9 - 1:9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\nbind9-dnsutils - 1:9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\nbind9-host - 1:9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\nbind9-libs - 1:9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\nbind9-utils - 1:9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\nbind9utils - 1:9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\ndnsutils - 1:9.18.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.3\nNo subscription required",
