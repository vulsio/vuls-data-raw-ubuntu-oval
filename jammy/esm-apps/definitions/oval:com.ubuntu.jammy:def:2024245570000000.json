		"description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable softwarecontainerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cachepoisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to someinstructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not causea cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone isusing could poison their cache by making them pull a specially craftedimage that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some buildsteps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out ofBuildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /buildAPI endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted.Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function fromgithub.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classicbuilder by default. Patches are included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2 releases.",
