Instead, the commits listed in the patches section seems to properly fix the issue. for commit 30b84faba, _infos_set_glyph_flags() can be found as _unsafe_to_break_set_mask() for versios prior to 3.3.0, down to version 1.5.0, where the later was added. GPOS lookups (src/OT/Layout/GPOS) moved to the current code baseline in version 4.4.1, before it, some of the methods can be found in src/hb-ot-layout-gsubgpos.hh. releases prior to bionic does not have any of the code being fixed. bionic itself could be patched with some of the commits, but not all. a careful check seems necessary to evaluate if really possible to fix it."
