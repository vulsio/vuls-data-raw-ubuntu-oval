		"Title": "CVE-2022-45886 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c has a .disconnect versus dvb_device_open race condition that leads to a use-after-free. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45886` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-aws - 6.2.0-1013.13~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-gcp - 6.2.0-1016.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gke - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic-64k - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1039.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-kvm - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia - 6.2.0-1011.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia-64k - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1037-raspi - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-aws - 6.2.0-1013.13~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-gcp - 6.2.0-1016.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gke - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic-64k - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1039.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-kvm - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia - 6.2.0-1011.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia-64k - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48\nNo subscription required",
