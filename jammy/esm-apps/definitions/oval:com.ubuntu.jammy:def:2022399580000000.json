		"Description": "The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response bodybypass to sequentially exfiltrate small and undetectable sections of databy repeatedly submitting an HTTP Range header field with a small byterange. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected,may be exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a webapplication firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restrictedresource may bypass pattern matching techniques and allow undetectedaccess. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well asthe currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users areadvised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRSparanoia level of 3 or higher.",
