		"Title": "CVE-2022-3640 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Linux Kernel. Affected is the function l2cap_conn_del of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211944. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth stack in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3640` to fix the vulnerability.
