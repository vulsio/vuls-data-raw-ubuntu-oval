		"Title": "CVE-2023-45802 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a timewindow were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately.Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client couldsend new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open andcausing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, allresources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory beforethat. This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487(HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During \"normal\"HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memorywould not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-45802` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\napache2 - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\napache2-bin - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\napache2-data - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\napache2-suexec-custom - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\napache2-suexec-pristine - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\napache2-utils - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\nlibapache2-mod-md - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\nlibapache2-mod-proxy-uwsgi - 2.4.52-1ubuntu4.7\nNo subscription required",
