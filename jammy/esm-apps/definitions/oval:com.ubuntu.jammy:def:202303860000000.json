    "Title": "CVE-2023-0386 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - high.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s OverlayFS subsystem in how a user copies a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0386` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-70-generic - 5.15.0-70.77\nlinux-image-5.15.0-70-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-70.77\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-generic -
