    "Title": "CVE-2022-3707 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A double-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Intel GVT-g graphics driver triggers VGA card system resource overload, causing a fail in the intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page function. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system. Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3707` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gke - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gkeop - 5.15.0-1020.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-ibm - 5.15.0-1030.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-kvm - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1029-raspi - 5.15.0-1029.31\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1029-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1029.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gke - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gkeop - 5.15.0-1020.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-ibm - 5.15.0-1030.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-kvm - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41\nNo subscription required",
