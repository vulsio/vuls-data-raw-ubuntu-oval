		"description": "PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through PharDeserialization via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this issimilar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionalityproblem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable byPHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fixeliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-36326` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibphp-phpmailer - 6.2.0-2\nNo subscription required",
