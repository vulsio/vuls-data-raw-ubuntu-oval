Thisissue affects users that are using Client certificates only. The connectionitself is still secure. The Certificate provided by clients can't betrusted when using a Pion DTLS server prior to version 2.1.5. Users shouldupgrade to version 2.1.5 to receive a patch. There are currently no knownworkarounds.",
