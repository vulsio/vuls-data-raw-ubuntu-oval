		"Title": "CVE-2020-5217 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injectionvulnerability is present in versions before 3.8.0, 5.1.0, and 6.2.0. Ifuser-supplied input was passed intoappend/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could beinjected leading to directive injection. This could be used to e.g.override a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and thefirst one wins. The directives in secure_headers are sorted alphabeticallyso they pretty much all come before script-src. A previously undefineddirective would receive a value even if SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT wassupplied. The fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spacesand emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This will result ininnocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally used. Infuture releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s.Depending on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-5217` to fix the vulnerability.
