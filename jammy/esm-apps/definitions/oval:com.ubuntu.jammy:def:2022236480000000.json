		"Title": "CVE-2022-23648 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux andWindows. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and1.14.12 where containers launched through containerd’s CRI implementationon Linux with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain access toread-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host. This maybypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including aKubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitiveinformation. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to usecontainerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions to resolvethe issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23648` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncontainerd - 1.5.9-0ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
