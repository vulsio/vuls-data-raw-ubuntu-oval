    "Title": "CVE-2021-37137 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-37137` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnetty-java - 1:4.1.48-4+deb11u1build0.22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
