    "Title": "CVE-2023-1078 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption. It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1078` to fix the vulnerability.
