		"Title": "CVE-2022-31108 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that usesMarkdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modifycomplex diagrams. An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into thegenerated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside ofthe generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information byusing specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how anattacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the`value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actualmatch, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" abackground image that will let an attacker know what's the value of thecharacter. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSSselectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows anattacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to performunintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has beenresolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable toupgrade should ensure that user input is adequately escaped beforeembedding it in CSS blocks.",
