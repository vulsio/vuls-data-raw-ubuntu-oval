		"Title": "CVE-2022-46176 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "Cargo is a Rust package manager. The Rust Security Response WG was notifiedthat Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification when cloning indexesand dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit this to performman-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability has been assignedCVE-2022-46176. All Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 arevulnerable. Note that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternateregistry indexes or crate dependencies, you might be affected by thisvulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections toGitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), asthat'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through SSH. Rust 1.66.1 willensure Cargo checks the SSH host key and abort the connection if theserver's public key is not already trusted. We recommend everyone toupgrade as soon as possible.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-46176` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncargo - 0.67.1+ds0ubuntu0.libgit2-0ubuntu0.22.04.2\nNo subscription required",
