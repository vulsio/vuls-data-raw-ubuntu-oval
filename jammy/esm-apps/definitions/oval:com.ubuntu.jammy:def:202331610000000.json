		"Title": "CVE-2023-3161 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Framebuffer Console (fbcon) in the Linux Kernel. When providing font->width and font->height greater than 32 to fbcon_set_font, since there are no checks in place, a shift-out-of-bounds occurs leading to undefined behavior and possible denial of service. Sanan Hasanov discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform checks for font dimension limits. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3161` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gke - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gkeop - 5.15.0-1020.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-ibm - 5.15.0-1030.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-kvm - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1029-raspi - 5.15.0-1029.31\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1029-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1029.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gke - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gkeop - 5.15.0-1020.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-ibm - 5.15.0-1030.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-kvm - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41\nNo subscription required",
