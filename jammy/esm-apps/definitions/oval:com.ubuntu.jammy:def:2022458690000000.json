    "Title": "CVE-2022-45869 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race condition in the x86 KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 6.1-rc6 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash or host OS memory corruption) when nested virtualisation and the TDP MMU are enabled. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 KVM subsystem implementation in the Linux kernel when nested virtualization and the TDP MMU are enabled. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45869` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1021-azure - 5.19.0-1021.22~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gkeop - 5.15.0-1016.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-ibm - 5.15.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-kvm - 5.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1018-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1018-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1025-raspi - 5.15.0-1025.27\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1025-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gkeop - 5.15.0-1016.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-ibm - 5.15.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-kvm - 5.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1018-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1018-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36\nNo subscription required",
