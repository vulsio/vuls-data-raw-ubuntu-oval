		"Title": "CVE-2022-3424 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s SGI GRU driver in the way the first gru_file_unlocked_ioctl function is called by the user, where a fail pass occurs in the gru_check_chiplet_assignment function. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI GRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3424` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1023-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gke - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gkeop - 5.15.0-1017.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-40-generic - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-40-generic - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-40-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-ibm - 5.15.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-kvm - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1022-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1022-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1006-oem - 6.1.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1026-raspi - 5.15.0-1026.28\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1026-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gke - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gkeop - 5.15.0-1017.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-40-generic - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-40-generic - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-40-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-ibm - 5.15.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-kvm - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1022-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1022-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1006-oem - 6.1.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38\nNo subscription required",
