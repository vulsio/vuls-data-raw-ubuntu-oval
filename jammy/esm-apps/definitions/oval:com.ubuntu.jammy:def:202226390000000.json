		"Title": "CVE-2022-2639 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "An integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Givena sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memoryfor a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does notreturn -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds writeaccess. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalatetheir privileges on the system.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2639` to fix the vulnerability.
