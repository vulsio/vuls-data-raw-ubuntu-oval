		"Title": "CVE-2022-31160 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of jQuery. Versions prior to 1.13.2 are potentially vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Initializing a checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that parent label contents considered as the input label. Calling `.checkboxradio( \"refresh\" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML contained encoded HTML entities will make them erroneously get decoded. This can lead to potentially executing JavaScript code. The bug has been patched in jQuery UI 1.13.2. To remediate the issue, someone who can change the initial HTML can wrap all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-31160` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjs-jquery-ui - 1.13.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nnode-jquery-ui - 1.13.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
