		"description": "In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled),transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing wasvulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could beinterpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could beinterpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind anintermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowedarbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could beused to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fakepipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as arequest.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-7657` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njetty9 - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-extra-java - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-java - 9.2.26-1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
