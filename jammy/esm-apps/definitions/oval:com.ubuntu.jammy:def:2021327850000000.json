		"Title": "CVE-2021-32785 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party,authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. Whenmod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use anunencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionTypeserver-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performedargument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, whichwould perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug.Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gainingarbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service byrepeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected inversion 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the`hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated bysetting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographicallyhashed before use when this option is enabled.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32785` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibapache2-mod-auth-openidc - 2.4.9-1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
