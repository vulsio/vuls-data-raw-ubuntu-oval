		"Title": "CVE-2023-25153 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. Before versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25153` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncontainerd - 1.6.12-0ubuntu1~22.04.3\nNo subscription required",
