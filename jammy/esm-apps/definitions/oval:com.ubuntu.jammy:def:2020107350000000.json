    "Title": "CVE-2020-10735 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - negligible.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int(\"text\"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. To avoid backwards-incompatible changes Ubuntu Security will not apply Python’s CVE-2020-10735 bugfix. Ubuntu Security does not consider int<->str conversion a security issue in Python. Rather, developers may introduce Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities into their code by parsing unsanitized data with int<->str conversion. Developers using bignum integers are encouraged to consider specialized libraries, such as GMP. Using PyLong_FromString() in public APIs without an integer limit is strongly discouraged.",

That number has 80 digits.\" - so 5000 digits out to be enough for anyone eslerm> ongoing discourse on https://discuss.python.org LWN reports patch causes regressions"
