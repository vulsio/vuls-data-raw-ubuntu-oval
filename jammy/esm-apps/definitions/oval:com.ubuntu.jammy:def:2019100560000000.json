		"description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The code mishandles the case ofsending a network packet with the right type, such that the functionDecodeEthernet in decode-ethernet.c is executed a second time. At thispoint, the algorithm cuts the first part of the packet and doesn'tdetermine the current length. Specifically, if the packet is exactly 28long, in the first iteration it subtracts 14 bytes. Then, it is workingwith a packet length of 14. At this point, the case distinction says it isa valid packet. After that it casts the packet, but this packet has notype, and the program crashes at the type case distinction.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10056` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsuricata - 1:4.1.4-1\nsuricata-oinkmaster - 1:4.1.4-1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
