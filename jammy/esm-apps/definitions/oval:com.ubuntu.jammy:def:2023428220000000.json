    "Title": "CVE-2023-42822 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol server. Access to the font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-42822` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nxrdp - 0.9.17-2ubuntu2+esm1\nNo subscription required",
