		"Title": "CVE-2023-4385 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing sanity check. It was discovered that the JFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate memory allocations in certain situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious JFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4385` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-47-generic - 5.15.0-47.51\nlinux-image-5.15.0-47-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-47.51\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-generic - 5.15.0-47.51\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-generic-64k - 5.15.0-47.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-aws - 5.15.0-1019.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-aws - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure - 5.15.0-1019.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gcp - 5.15.0-1017.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-gcp - 6.2.0-1009.9~22.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-gke - 5.15.0-1015.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gkeop - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic-64k - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-ibm - 5.15.0-1013.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-kvm - 5.15.0-1017.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-lowlatency - 5.15.0-47.53\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-47.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-nvidia - 5.15.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-nvidia-64k - 5.15.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1006-oem - 6.0.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-oracle - 5.15.0-1017.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1014-raspi - 5.15.0-1014.16\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1014-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1014.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-47-generic - 5.15.0-47.51\nlinux-image-5.15.0-47-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-47.51\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-generic - 5.15.0-47.51\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-generic-64k - 5.15.0-47.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-aws - 5.15.0-1019.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-aws - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure - 5.15.0-1019.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gcp - 5.15.0-1017.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-gcp - 6.2.0-1009.9~22.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-gke - 5.15.0-1015.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gkeop - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic-64k - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-ibm - 5.15.0-1013.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-kvm - 5.15.0-1017.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-lowlatency - 5.15.0-47.53\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-47-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-47.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-nvidia - 5.15.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-nvidia-64k - 5.15.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1006-oem - 6.0.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-oracle - 5.15.0-1017.22\nNo subscription required",
