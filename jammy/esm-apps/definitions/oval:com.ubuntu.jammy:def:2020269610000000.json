		"description": "When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and relatedIP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoHresolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, theseaddresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNSRebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR <78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26961` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 83.0+build2-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 83.0+build2-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 83.0+build2-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nthunderbird - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
