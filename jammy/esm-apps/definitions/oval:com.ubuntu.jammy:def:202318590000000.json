		"Title": "CVE-2023-1859 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in xen_9pfs_front_removet in net/9p/trans_xen.c in Xen transport for 9pfs in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem, possibly leading to a kernel information leak. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer implementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1859` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic-64k - 5.15.0-75.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-aws - 5.15.0-1038.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-azure - 5.15.0-1040.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1040.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gcp - 5.15.0-1036.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gke - 5.15.0-1036.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-gkeop - 5.15.0-1022.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-ibm - 5.15.0-1032.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-kvm - 5.15.0-1035.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-75.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-nvidia - 5.15.0-1027.27\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1027.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1031-oem - 5.17.0-1031.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1015-oem - 6.0.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1010-oem - 6.1.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-oracle - 5.15.0-1037.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1032-raspi - 5.15.0-1032.35\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1032-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1032.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic-64k - 5.15.0-75.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-aws - 5.15.0-1038.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-azure - 5.15.0-1040.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1040.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gcp - 5.15.0-1036.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gke - 5.15.0-1036.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-gkeop - 5.15.0-1022.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-ibm - 5.15.0-1032.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-kvm - 5.15.0-1035.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency - 5.15.0-75.82\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-75.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-nvidia - 5.15.0-1027.27\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1027.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1031-oem - 5.17.0-1031.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1015-oem - 6.0.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1010-oem - 6.1.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-oracle - 5.15.0-1037.43\nNo subscription required",
