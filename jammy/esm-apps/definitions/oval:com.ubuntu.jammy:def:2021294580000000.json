		"description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds readwas found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read istriggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denialof service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into runningExiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered whenwriting the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation thanreading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argumentsuch as insert. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29458` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nexiv2 - 0.27.3-3ubuntu2\nlibexiv2-27 - 0.27.3-3ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
