    "Title": "CVE-2022-3526 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Linux Kernel. This vulnerability affects the function macvlan_handle_frame of the file drivers/net/macvlan.c of the component skb. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack can be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211024. It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the macvlan driver in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3526` to fix the vulnerability.
