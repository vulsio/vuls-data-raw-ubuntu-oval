    "Title": "CVE-2023-20032 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library was disclosed: A vulnerability in the HFS+ partition file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in a heap buffer overflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV scanning process, or else crash the process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog [\"https://blog.clamav.net/\"].\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-20032` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nclamav - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nclamav-base - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nclamav-daemon - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nclamav-freshclam - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nclamav-milter - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nclamav-testfiles - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nclamdscan - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nlibclamav9 - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu0.22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
