		"Title": "CVE-2021-39135 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees andmanages the node_modules folder hierarchy for the npm command lineinterface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met,and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into theexpected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into aproject's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the rootproject or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symboliclink, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to anyarbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links containedwithin package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means ofcreating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A`preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This isprevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply thetarget with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install--ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install--ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of theproject directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For moreinformation including workarounds please see the referencedGHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.",
