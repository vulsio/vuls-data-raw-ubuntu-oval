		"description": "A possible unauthorized memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel'scpu_entry_area mapping of X86 CPU data to memory, where a user may guessthe location of exception stacks or other important data. Based on theprevious CVE-2023-0597, the 'Randomize per-cpu entry area' feature wasimplemented in /arch/x86/mm/cpu_entry_area.c, which works through theinit_cea_offsets() function when KASLR is enabled. However, despite thisfeature, there is still a risk of per-cpu entry area leaks. This issuecould allow a local user to gain access to some important data with memoryin an expected location and potentially escalate their privileges on thesystem.",
