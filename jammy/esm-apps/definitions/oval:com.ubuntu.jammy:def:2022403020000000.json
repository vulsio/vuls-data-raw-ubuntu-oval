    "Title": "CVE-2022-40302 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) through 8.4. By crafting a BGP OPEN message with an option of type 0xff (Extended Length from RFC 9072), attackers may cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon restart, or out-of-bounds read). This is possible because of inconsistent boundary checks that do not account for reading 3 bytes (instead of 2) in this 0xff case.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-40302` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfrr - 8.1-1ubuntu1.3\nfrr-pythontools - 8.1-1ubuntu1.3\nfrr-rpki-rtrlib - 8.1-1ubuntu1.3\nfrr-snmp - 8.1-1ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
