		"Title": "CVE-2023-2002 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the HCI sockets implementation due to a missing capability check in net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to unauthorized execution of management commands, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Bluetooth communication. Ruihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (bluetooth communication).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2002` to fix the vulnerability.
