		"Title": "CVE-2022-23645 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket, character device, and Linux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3, 0.6.2, and 0.7.1 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of swtpm's state, where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid value, may cause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array representing the state of the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash swtpm or prevent it from starting since the state cannot be understood. Users should upgrade to swtpm v0.5.3, v0.6.2, or v0.7.1 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23645` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nswtpm - 0.6.3-0ubuntu3\nswtpm-tools - 0.6.3-0ubuntu3\nNo subscription required",
