		"Title": "CVE-2022-42329 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329). It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend driver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42329` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1022-azure - 5.19.0-1022.23~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gkeop - 5.15.0-1016.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-38-generic - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-38-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-38-generic - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-38-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-ibm - 5.15.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-kvm - 5.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1021-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1021-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1025-raspi - 5.15.0-1025.27\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1025-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gkeop - 5.15.0-1016.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-38-generic - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-38-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-38-generic - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-38-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-ibm - 5.15.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-kvm - 5.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1021-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1021-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36\nNo subscription required",
