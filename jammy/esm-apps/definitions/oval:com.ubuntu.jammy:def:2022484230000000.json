		"Title": "CVE-2022-48423 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.1.3, fs/ntfs3/record.c does not validate resident attribute names. An out-of-bounds write may occur. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48423` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gke - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gkeop - 5.15.0-1017.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-ibm - 5.15.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-kvm - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1026-raspi - 5.15.0-1026.28\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1026-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gke - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gkeop - 5.15.0-1017.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-42-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-42-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-ibm - 5.15.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-kvm - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1024-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38\nNo subscription required",
