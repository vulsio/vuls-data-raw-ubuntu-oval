		"Title": "CVE-2022-3028 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket. Abhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3028` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic-64k - 5.15.0-53.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-aws - 5.15.0-1023.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-azure - 5.15.0-1023.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1023.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-gcp - 5.15.0-1022.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gke - 5.15.0-1020.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-gkeop - 5.15.0-1008.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-ibm - 5.15.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1018.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-kvm - 5.15.0-1021.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-53.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1006-oem - 6.0.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-oracle - 5.15.0-1022.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1018-raspi - 5.15.0-1018.20\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1018-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic-64k - 5.15.0-53.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-aws - 5.15.0-1023.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-azure - 5.15.0-1023.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1023.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-gcp - 5.15.0-1022.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gke - 5.15.0-1020.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-gkeop - 5.15.0-1008.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-ibm - 5.15.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1018.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-kvm - 5.15.0-1021.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-53.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1006-oem - 6.0.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-oracle - 5.15.0-1022.28\nNo subscription required",
