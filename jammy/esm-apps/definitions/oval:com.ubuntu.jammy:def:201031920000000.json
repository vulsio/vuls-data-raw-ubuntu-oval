		"Title": "CVE-2010-3192 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - negligible.",
		"Description": "Certain run-time memory protection mechanisms in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) print argv[0] and backtrace information, which might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by executing an incorrect program, as demonstrated by a setuid program that contains a stack-based buffer overflow error, related to the __fortify_fail function in debug/fortify_fail.c, and the __stack_chk_fail (aka stack protection) and __chk_fail (aka FORTIFY_SOURCE) implementations.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2010-3192` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nglibc-source - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlibc-bin - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlibc6 - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlibc6-amd64 - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlibc6-i386 - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlibc6-prof - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlibc6-s390 - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlibc6-x32 - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlocales - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nlocales-all - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nnscd - 2.29-0ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
