		"Title": "CVE-2022-3625 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function devlink_param_set/devlink_param_get of the file net/core/devlink.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211929 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the Netlink device interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability with some network device drivers. A local attacker with admin access to the network device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3625` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-53.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic -
