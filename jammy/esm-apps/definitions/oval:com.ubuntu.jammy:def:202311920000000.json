    "Title": "CVE-2023-1192 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in smb2_is_status_io_timeout() in CIFS in the Linux Kernel. After CIFS transfers response data to a system call, there are still local variable points to the memory region, and if the system call frees it faster than CIFS uses it, CIFS will access a free memory region, leading to a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1192` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gke - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-kvm - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia - 5.15.0-1032.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1032.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1037-raspi - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gke - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-kvm - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia - 5.15.0-1032.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1032.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48\nNo subscription required",
