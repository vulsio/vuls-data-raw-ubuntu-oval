		"Title": "CVE-2023-4015 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. On an error when building a nftables rule, deactivating immediate expressions in nft_immediate_deactivate() can lead unbinding the chain and objects be deactivated but later used. We recommend upgrading past commit 0a771f7b266b02d262900c75f1e175c7fe76fec2. Kevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bound chain deactivation in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4015` to fix the vulnerability.
