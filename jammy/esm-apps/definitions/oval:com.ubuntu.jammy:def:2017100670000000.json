		"Title": "CVE-2017-10067 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). It was discovered that the JAR verifier in OpenJDK did not properly handle archives containing files missing digests. An attacker could use this to modify the signed contents of a JAR file.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-10067` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u141-b15-1\nNo subscription required",
