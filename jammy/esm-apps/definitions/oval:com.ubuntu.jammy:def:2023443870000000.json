		"title": "CVE-2023-44387 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support formulti-language development. When copying or archiving symlinked files,Gradle resolves them but applies the permissions of the symlink itselfinstead of the permissions of the linked file to the resulting file. Thisleads to files having too much permissions given that symlinks usually areworld readable and writeable. While it is unlikely this results in a directvulnerability for the impacted build, it may open up attack vectorsdepending on where build artifacts end up being copied to or un-archived.In versions 7.6.3, 8.4 and above, Gradle will now properly use thepermissions of the file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of thecopied or archived file.",
