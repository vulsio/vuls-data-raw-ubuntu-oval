		"description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositoriesin the root composer.json and package source download URLs are notsanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to beexecuted in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. Theimpact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file istypically under their own control and source download URLs can only besupplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust todownload and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The mainimpact is to services passing user input to Composer, includingPackagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remotecode execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org andPrivate Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability reportand based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abusedby anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver orderivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade theircomposer/composer dependency immediately.
