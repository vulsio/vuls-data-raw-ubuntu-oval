		"Title": "CVE-2022-3996 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function. Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3996` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.9\nopenssl - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.9\nNo subscription required",
