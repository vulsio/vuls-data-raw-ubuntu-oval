		"Title": "CVE-2023-4273 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the exFAT driver of the Linux kernel. The vulnerabilityexists in the implementation of the file name reconstruction function,which is responsible for reading file name entries from a directory indexand merging file name parts belonging to one file into a single long filename. Since the file name characters are copied into a stack variable, alocal privileged attacker could use this flaw to overflow the kernel stack.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4273` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic-64k - 5.15.0-86.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-kvm - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-aws - 5.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure - 5.15.0-1049.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1049.56.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gcp - 5.15.0-1044.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gke - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gkeop - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-ibm - 5.15.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency - 5.15.0-86.95\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-86.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-nvidia - 5.15.0-1037.37\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1037.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-oracle - 5.15.0-1045.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1021-oem - 6.0.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1021-oem - 6.1.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1040-raspi - 5.15.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1025-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.15.0-1025.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-aws - 6.2.0-1013.13~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic-64k - 6.2.0-34.34~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-gcp - 6.2.0-1016.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1014.14~22.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia - 6.2.0-1011.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia-64k - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required",
