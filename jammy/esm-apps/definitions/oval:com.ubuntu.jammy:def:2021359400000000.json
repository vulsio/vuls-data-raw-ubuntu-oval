		"Description": "An out-of-bounds array read in the apr_time_exp*() functions was fixed in the Apache Portable Runtime 1.6.3 release (CVE-2017-12613). The fix for this issue was not carried forward to the APR 1.7.x branch, and hence version 1.7.0 regressed compared to 1.6.3 and is vulnerable to the same issue.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-35940` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibapr1 - 1.7.0-6ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
