		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata before 6.0.4. It is possible tobypass/evade any HTTP-based signature by faking an RST TCP packet withrandom TCP options of the md5header from the client side. After thethree-way handshake, it's possible to inject an RST ACK with a random TCPmd5header option. Then, the client can send an HTTP GET request with aforbidden URL. The server will ignore the RST ACK and send the responseHTTP packet for the client's request. These packets will not trigger aSuricata reject action.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-45098` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsuricata - 1:6.0.4-3\nNo subscription required",
