    "Title": "CVE-2022-29581 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - high.",
    "Description": "Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14 and later versions. Kyle Zeng discovered that the Network Queuing and Scheduling subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29581` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-aws - 5.15.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-gcp - 5.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-gke - 5.15.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-ibm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-kvm - 5.15.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1006-oem - 5.17.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-oracle - 5.15.0-1006.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1008-raspi - 5.15.0-1008.8\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1008-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-aws - 5.15.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-gcp - 5.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-gke - 5.15.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-ibm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-kvm - 5.15.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1006-oem - 5.17.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-oracle - 5.15.0-1006.8\nNo subscription required",
