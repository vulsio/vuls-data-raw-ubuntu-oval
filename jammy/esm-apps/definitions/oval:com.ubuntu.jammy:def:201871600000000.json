		"Title": "CVE-2018-7160 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-7160` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnode72 - 8.11.2~dfsg-1\nnodejs - 8.11.2~dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
