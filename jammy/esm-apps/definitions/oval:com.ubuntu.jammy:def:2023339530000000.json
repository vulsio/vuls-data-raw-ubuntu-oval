		"Title": "CVE-2023-33953 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errorscould lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers inexceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOSattacks: - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser - Unbounded CPUconsumption in the HPACK parser The unbounded CPU consumption is down to acopy that occurred per-input-block in the parser, and because that could beunbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop,with n selected by the client. The unbounded memory buffering bugs: - Theheader size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we needed tofirst buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8or 16kb. - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite numberof 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser neededto read all of them before concluding a parse. - gRPC’s metadata overflowcheck was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of framescould cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION:containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc…",
