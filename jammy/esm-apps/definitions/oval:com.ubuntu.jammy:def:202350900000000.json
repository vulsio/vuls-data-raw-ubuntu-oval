		"Title": "CVE-2023-5090 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - high.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in KVM. An improper check in svm_set_x2apic_msr_interception() may allow direct access to host x2apic msrs when the guest resets its apic, potentially leading to a denial of service condition. Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-5090` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic-64k - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-lowlatency - 5.13.0-19.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1005-aws - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1006-azure - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1005-gcp - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gke - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1004-kvm - 5.13.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency - 5.15.0-22.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-22.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia - 5.15.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia-64k - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1026-oem - 6.1.0-1026.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-oem - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-oracle - 5.13.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-raspi - 5.13.0-1008.9\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-raspi-nolpae - 5.13.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic-64k - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-lowlatency - 5.13.0-19.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1005-aws - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1006-azure - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1005-gcp - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gke - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1004-kvm - 5.13.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency - 5.15.0-22.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-22.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia - 5.15.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia-64k - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1026-oem - 6.1.0-1026.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-oem - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-oracle - 5.13.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required",
