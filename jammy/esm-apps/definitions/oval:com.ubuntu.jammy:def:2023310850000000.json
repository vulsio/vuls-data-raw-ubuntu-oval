		"Title": "CVE-2023-31085 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/mtd/ubi/cdev.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a divide-by-zero error in do_div(sz,mtd->erasesize), used indirectly by ctrl_cdev_ioctl, when mtd->erasesize is 0. Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31085` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-aws - 5.15.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-ibm - 5.15.0-1043.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1045.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-kvm - 5.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia - 5.15.0-1041.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1041.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1025-oem - 6.1.0-1025.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-oem - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-oracle - 5.15.0-1048.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1043-raspi - 5.15.0-1043.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-aws - 5.15.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-ibm - 5.15.0-1043.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1045.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-kvm - 5.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia - 5.15.0-1041.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1041.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1025-oem - 6.1.0-1025.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-oem - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-oracle - 5.15.0-1048.54\nNo subscription required",
