    "Title": "CVE-2022-3521 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function kcm_tx_work of the file net/kcm/kcmsock.c of the component kcm. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211018 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection Multiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing sockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3521` to fix the vulnerability.
