		"Title": "CVE-2022-0001 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - high.",
		"Description": "Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by Intel to their processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0001` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-23-generic - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-5.15.0-23-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-generic - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-generic-64k - 5.15.0-23.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-aws - 5.15.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-azure - 5.15.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gke - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-kvm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-lowlatency - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-23.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1003-oem - 5.17.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1006-oem - 6.0.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1004-raspi - 5.15.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1004-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-23-generic - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-5.15.0-23-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-generic - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-generic-64k - 5.15.0-23.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-aws - 5.15.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-azure - 5.15.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gke - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-kvm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-lowlatency - 5.15.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-23-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-23.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1003-oem - 5.17.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1006-oem - 6.0.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required",
