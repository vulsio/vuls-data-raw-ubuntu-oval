    "Title": "CVE-2023-2194 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device driver. The userspace \"data->block[0]\" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution. It was discovered that the SLIMpro I2C device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate user-supplied data in some situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2194` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1035-raspi - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required",
