		"title": "CVE-2017-7658 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - low",
		"description": "In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.xconfigurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presentedwith two content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presentedwith a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length wasignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorterlength, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could beinterpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary wasimposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass thatauthorization.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-7658` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njetty9 - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-extra-java - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-java - 9.2.26-1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
