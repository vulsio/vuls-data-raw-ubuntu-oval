		"Title": "CVE-2023-39192 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure. Sunjoo Park discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate u32 packets content, leading to an out-of- bounds read vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39192` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1023-oem - 6.1.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1023-oem - 6.1.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required",
