		"description": "Libarchive through 3.6.2 can cause directories to have world-writablepermissions. The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes theumask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a racecondition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Sucha race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged localuser can delete and rename files inside those directories.",
