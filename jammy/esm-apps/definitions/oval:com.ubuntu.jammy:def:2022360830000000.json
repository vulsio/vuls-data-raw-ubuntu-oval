		"description": "JOSE is \"JSON Web Almost Everything\" - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK, JWKS withno dependencies using runtime's native crypto in Node.js, Browser,Cloudflare Workers, Electron, and Deno. The PBKDF2-based JWE key managementalgorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c` PBES2 Count, whichdetermines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be executed in order to derive aCEK wrapping key. The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slowdown the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force anddictionary attacks more expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithmsunsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source:an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value,that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonableamount of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to havethe user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time. The impactis limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetricsecrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit theaccepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the`keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option orthrough other means. The `v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2`releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. Itis possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count`decryption option. If users are unable to upgrade their required libraryversion, they have two options depending on whether they expect to receiveJWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms.They can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disableaccepting PBKDF2 altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header prior tousing the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` HeaderParameter).",
