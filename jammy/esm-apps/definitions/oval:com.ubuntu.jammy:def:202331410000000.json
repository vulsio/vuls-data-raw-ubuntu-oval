		"Title": "CVE-2023-3141 on Ubuntu 22.04 ESM (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in r592_remove in drivers/memstick/host/r592.c in media access in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system at device disconnect, possibly leading to a kernel information leak. It was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3141` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-aws - 5.19.0-1029.30~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1030-gcp - 5.19.0-1030.32~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-50-generic - 5.19.0-50.50\nlinux-image-5.19.0-50-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-50.50\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-50-generic - 5.19.0-50.50\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-50-generic-64k - 5.19.0-50.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1030-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1030-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1021-oem - 6.0.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1035-raspi - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-aws - 5.19.0-1029.30~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1030-gcp - 5.19.0-1030.32~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-50-generic - 5.19.0-50.50\nlinux-image-5.19.0-50-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-50.50\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-50-generic - 5.19.0-50.50\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-50-generic-64k - 5.19.0-50.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1030-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1030-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1021-oem - 6.0.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required",
