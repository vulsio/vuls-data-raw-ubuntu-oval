		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc3: core: remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume toavoid deadlockWhen config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger systemto enter suspend status with below command:echo mem > /sys/power/stateThere will be a deadlock issue occurring. Detailed invoking path asbelow:dwc3_suspend_common()    spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);              <-- 1st    dwc3_gadget_suspend(dwc);        dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect(dwc);            spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);      <-- 2ndThis issue is exposed by commit c7ebd8149ee5 (\"usb: dwc3: gadget: FixNULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend\") that removes the codeof checking whether dwc->gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes thefollowing code is executed and deadlock occurs when trying to get thespinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442(\"usb: dwc3:Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume\") that forgot to removethe lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode duringgadget suspend/resume.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42085` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-73-fips - 5.15.0-73.80+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.15.0-73-fips - 5.15.0-73.80+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
