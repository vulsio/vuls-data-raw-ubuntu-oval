		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tablescomponent can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Thenft_verdict_init() function allows positive values as drop error within thehook verdict, and hence the nf_hook_slow() function can cause a double freevulnerability when NF_DROP is issued with a drop error which resemblesNF_ACCEPT.
