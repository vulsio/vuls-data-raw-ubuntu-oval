		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: arm64:entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entry Zenghui reports thatbooting a kernel with \"irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1\" on the command line hitsa warning during kernel entry, due to the way we manipulate the PMR. Earlyin the entry sequence, we call lockdep_hardirqs_off() to inform lockdepthat interrupts have been masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhen entering anexception). Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected by exception entry, andwe don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early in the exception entrysequence, so early in exception entry the PMR can indicate that interruptsare unmasked even though they are masked by DAIF. If DEBUG_LOCKDEP isselected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check that interrupts are masked,before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of the exception entry paths, andhence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN() that something is amiss. We canavoid this by consistently setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during exceptionentry so that kernel code sees a consistent environment. We must alsoupdate local_daif_inherit() to undo this, as currently only touches DAIF.For other paths, local_daif_restore() will update both DAIF and the PMR.With this done, we can remove the existing special cases which set thislater in the entry code. We always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON |GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency with local_daif_save(), as this willwarn if it ever encounters (GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), andnever sets this itself. This matches the gic_prio_kentry_setup that we haveto retain for ret_to_user. The original splat from Zenghui's report was: |DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(!irqs_disabled()) | WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 125 atkernel/locking/lockdep.c:4258 lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8 | Moduleslinked in: | CPU: 3 PID: 125 Comm: modprobe Tainted: G W 5.12.0-rc8+ #463 |Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015 | pstate:604003c5 (nZCv DAIF +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--) | pc :lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8 | lr : lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8 | sp :ffff80002a39bad0 | pmr_save: 000000e0 | x29: ffff80002a39bad0 x28:ffff0000de214bc0 | x27: ffff0000de1c0400 x26: 000000000049b328 | x25:0000000000406f30 x24: ffff0000de1c00a0 | x23: 0000000020400005 x22:ffff8000105f747c | x21: 0000000096000044 x20: 0000000000498ef9 | x19:ffff80002a39bc88 x18: ffffffffffffffff | x17: 0000000000000000 x16:ffff800011c61eb0 | x15: ffff800011700a88 x14: 0720072007200720 | x13:0720072007200720 x12: 0720072007200720 | x11: 0720072007200720 x10:0720072007200720 | x9 : ffff80002a39bad0 x8 : ffff80002a39bad0 | x7 :ffff8000119f0800 x6 : c0000000ffff7fff | x5 : ffff8000119f07a8 x4 :0000000000000001 | x3 : 9bcdab23f2432800 x2 : ffff800011730538 | x1 :9bcdab23f2432800 x0 : 0000000000000000 | Call trace: |lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8 | enter_from_kernel_mode.isra.5+0x7c/0xa8 |el1_abort+0x24/0x100 | el1_sync_handler+0x80/0xd0 | el1_sync+0x6c/0x100 |__arch_clear_user+0xc/0x90 | load_elf_binary+0x9fc/0x1450 |bprm_execve+0x404/0x880 | kernel_execve+0x180/0x188 |call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0xdc/0x158 | ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46997` to fix the vulnerability.
