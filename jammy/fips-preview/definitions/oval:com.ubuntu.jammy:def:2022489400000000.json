		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix crash due to incorrect copy_map_valueWhen both bpf_spin_lock and bpf_timer are present in a BPF map value,copy_map_value needs to skirt both objects when copying a value into andout of the map. However, the current code does not set both s_off andt_off in copy_map_value, which leads to a crash when e.g. bpf_spin_lockis placed in map value with bpf_timer, as bpf_map_update_elem call willbe able to overwrite the other timer object.When the issue is not fixed, an overwriting can produce the followingsplat:[root@(none) bpf]# ./test_progs -t timer_crash[   15.930339] bpf_testmod: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.[   16.037849]==================================================================[   16.038458] BUG: KASAN: user-memory-access in__pv_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x32b/0x520[   16.038944] Write of size 8 at addr 0000000000043ec0 by tasktest_progs/325[   16.039399][   16.039514] CPU: 0 PID: 325 Comm: test_progs Tainted: G           OE5.16.0+ #278[   16.039983] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOSArchLinux 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014[   16.040485] Call Trace:[   16.040645]  <TASK>[   16.040805]  dump_stack_lvl+0x59/0x73[   16.041069]  ? __pv_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x32b/0x520[   16.041427]  kasan_report.cold+0x116/0x11b[   16.041673]  ? __pv_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x32b/0x520[   16.042040]  __pv_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x32b/0x520[   16.042328]  ? memcpy+0x39/0x60[   16.042552]  ? pv_hash+0xd0/0xd0[   16.042785]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_off+0x95/0xd0[   16.043079]  __bpf_spin_lock_irqsave+0xdf/0xf0[   16.043366]  ? bpf_get_current_comm+0x50/0x50[   16.043608]  ? jhash+0x11a/0x270[   16.043848]  bpf_timer_cancel+0x34/0xe0[   16.044119]  bpf_prog_c4ea1c0f7449940d_sys_enter+0x7c/0x81[   16.044500]  bpf_trampoline_6442477838_0+0x36/0x1000[   16.044836]  __x64_sys_nanosleep+0x5/0x140[   16.045119]  do_syscall_64+0x59/0x80[   16.045377]  ? lock_is_held_type+0xe4/0x140[   16.045670]  ? irqentry_exit_to_user_mode+0xa/0x40[   16.046001]  ? mark_held_locks+0x24/0x90[   16.046287]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x1e/0x30[   16.046569]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x8/0x30[   16.046851]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x7e/0x100[   16.047137]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae[   16.047405] RIP: 0033:0x7f9e4831718d[   16.047602] Code: b4 0c 00 0f 05 eb a9 66 0f 1f 44 00 00 f3 0f 1e fa 4889 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05<48> 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d b3 6c 0c 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48[   16.048764] RSP: 002b:00007fff488086b8 EFLAGS: 00000206 ORIG_RAX:0000000000000023[   16.049275] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007f9e48683740 RCX:00007f9e4831718d[   16.049747] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI:00007fff488086d0[   16.050225] RBP: 00007fff488086f0 R08: 00007fff488085d7 R09:00007f9e4cb594a0[   16.050648] R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000206 R12:00007f9e484cde30[   16.051124] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15:0000000000000000[   16.051608]  </TASK>[   16.051762]==================================================================\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48940` to fix the vulnerability.
