		"description": "TorchServe is a flexible and easy-to-use tool for serving and scalingPyTorch models in production. TorchServe 's check on allowed_urlsconfiguration can be by-passed if the URL contains characters such as \"..\"but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded into the modelstore. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing aURL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls securitycheck. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC)through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected. This issue in TorchServehas been fixed by validating the URL without characters such as \"..\" beforedownloading see PR #3082. TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix toaddress this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are noknown workarounds for this vulnerability.",
