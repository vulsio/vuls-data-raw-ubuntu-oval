		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:gadget: f_ncm: Fix UAF ncm object at re-bind after usb ep transport errorWhen ncm function is working and then stop usb0 interface for link down,eth_stop() is called. At this piont, accidentally if usb transport errorshould happen in usb_ep_enable(), 'in_ep' and/or 'out_ep' may not beenabled. After that, ncm_disable() is called to disable for ncm unbind butgether_disconnect() is never called since 'in_ep' is not enabled. As theresult, ncm object is released in ncm unbind but 'dev->port_usb' associatedto 'ncm->port' is not NULL. And when ncm bind again to recover netdev, ncmobject is reallocated but usb0 interface is already associated to previousreleased ncm object. Therefore, once usb0 interface is up andeth_start_xmit() is called, released ncm object is dereferrenced and itmight cause use-after-free memory. [function unlink via configfs] usb0:eth_stop dev->port_usb=ffffff9b179c3200 --> error happens inusb_ep_enable(). NCM: ncm_disable: ncm=ffffff9b179c3200 --> nogether_disconnect() since ncm->port.in_ep->enabled is false. NCM:ncm_unbind: ncm unbind ncm=ffffff9b179c3200 NCM: ncm_free: ncm freencm=ffffff9b179c3200 <-- released ncm [function link via configfs] NCM:ncm_alloc: ncm alloc ncm=ffffff9ac4f8a000 NCM: ncm_bind: ncm bindncm=ffffff9ac4f8a000 NCM: ncm_set_alt: ncm=ffffff9ac4f8a000 alt=0 usb0:eth_open dev->port_usb=ffffff9b179c3200 <-- previous released ncm usb0:eth_start dev->port_usb=ffffff9b179c3200 <-- eth_start_xmit() -->dev->wrap() Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual addressdead00000000014f This patch addresses the issue by checking if'ncm->netdev' is not NULL at ncm_disable() to call gether_disconnect() todeassociate 'dev->port_usb'. It's more reasonable to check 'ncm->netdev' tocall gether_connect/disconnect rather than check 'ncm->port.in_ep->enabled'since it might not be enabled but the gether connection might beestablished.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26996` to fix the vulnerability.
