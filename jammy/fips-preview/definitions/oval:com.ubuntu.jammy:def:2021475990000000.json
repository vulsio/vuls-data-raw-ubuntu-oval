		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:use latest_dev in btrfs_show_devname The test case btrfs/238 reports thewarning below: WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 481 at fs/btrfs/super.c:2509btrfs_show_devname+0x104/0x1e8 [btrfs] CPU: 2 PID: 1 Comm: systemd Tainted:G W O 5.14.0-rc1-custom #72 Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS0.0.0 02/06/2015 Call trace: btrfs_show_devname+0x108/0x1b4 [btrfs]show_mountinfo+0x234/0x2c4 m_show+0x28/0x34 seq_read_iter+0x12c/0x3c4vfs_read+0x29c/0x2c8 ksys_read+0x80/0xec __arm64_sys_read+0x28/0x34invoke_syscall+0x50/0xf8 do_el0_svc+0x88/0x138 el0_svc+0x2c/0x8cel0t_64_sync_handler+0x84/0xe4 el0t_64_sync+0x198/0x19c Reason: Whilebtrfs_prepare_sprout() moves the fs_devices::devices intofs_devices::seed_list, the btrfs_show_devname() searches for the devicesand found none, leading to the warning as in above. Fix: latest_dev isupdated according to the changes to the device list. That means we coulduse the latest_dev->name to show the device name in /proc/self/mounts, thepointer will be always valid as it's assigned before the device is deletedfrom the list in remove or replace. The RCU protection is sufficient as thedevice structure is freed after synchronization.",
