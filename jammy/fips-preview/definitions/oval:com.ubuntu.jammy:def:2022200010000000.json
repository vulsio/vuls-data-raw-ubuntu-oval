		"description": "fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1 isvulnerable to arbitrary code execution. git repositories can containper-repository configuration that change the behavior of git, includingrunning arbitrary commands. When using the default configuration of fish,changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order todisplay information about the current repository in the prompt. If anattacker can convince a user to change their current directory into onecontrolled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extractedarchive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control.This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in thesedirectories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potentialtrigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt`function from the prompt.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-20001` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfish - 3.3.1+ds-3ubuntu0.1~esm1\nfish-common - 3.3.1+ds-3ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
