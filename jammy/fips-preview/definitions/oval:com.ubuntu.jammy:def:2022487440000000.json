		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Avoid field-overflowing memcpy() In preparation forFORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time field bounds checkingfor memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid intentionally writing acrossneighboring fields. Use flexible arrays instead of zero-element arrays(which look like they are always overflowing) and split the cross-fieldmemcpy() into two halves that can be appropriately bounds-checked by thecompiler. We were doing: #define ETH_HLEN 14 #define VLAN_HLEN 4 ...#define MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE (ETH_HLEN + VLAN_HLEN) ... struct mlx5e_tx_wqe*wqe = mlx5_wq_cyc_get_wqe(wq, pi); ... struct mlx5_wqe_eth_seg *eseg =&wqe->eth; struct mlx5_wqe_data_seg *dseg = wqe->data; ...memcpy(eseg->inline_hdr.start, xdptxd->data, MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE); targetis wqe->eth.inline_hdr.start (which the compiler sees as being 2 bytes insize), but copying 18, intending to write across start (really vlan_tci, 2bytes). The remaining 16 bytes get written into wqe->data[0], coveringbyte_count (4 bytes), lkey (4 bytes), and addr (8 bytes). structmlx5e_tx_wqe { struct mlx5_wqe_ctrl_seg ctrl; /* 0 16 */ structmlx5_wqe_eth_seg eth; /* 16 16 */ struct mlx5_wqe_data_seg data[]; /* 32 0*/ /* size: 32, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */ /* last cacheline: 32 bytes */}; struct mlx5_wqe_eth_seg { u8 swp_outer_l4_offset; /* 0 1 */ u8swp_outer_l3_offset; /* 1 1 */ u8 swp_inner_l4_offset; /* 2 1 */ u8swp_inner_l3_offset; /* 3 1 */ u8 cs_flags; /* 4 1 */ u8 swp_flags; /* 5 1*/ __be16 mss; /* 6 2 */ __be32 flow_table_metadata; /* 8 4 */ union {struct { __be16 sz; /* 12 2 */ u8 start[2]; /* 14 2 */ } inline_hdr; /* 124 */ struct { __be16 type; /* 12 2 */ __be16 vlan_tci; /* 14 2 */ } insert;/* 12 4 */ __be32 trailer; /* 12 4 */ }; /* 12 4 */ /* size: 16,cachelines: 1, members: 9 */ /* last cacheline: 16 bytes */ }; structmlx5_wqe_data_seg { __be32 byte_count; /* 0 4 */ __be32 lkey; /* 4 4 */__be64 addr; /* 8 8 */ /* size: 16, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */ /* lastcacheline: 16 bytes */ }; So, split the memcpy() so the compiler can reasonabout the buffer sizes. \"pahole\" shows no size nor member offset changes tostruct mlx5e_tx_wqe nor struct mlx5e_umr_wqe. \"objdump -d\" shows nomeaningful object code changes (i.e. only source line number induceddifferences and optimizations).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48744` to fix the vulnerability.
