		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix memory leak in __add_inode_ref() Line 1169 (#3) allocates a memorychunk for victim_name by kmalloc(), but when the function returns in line1184 (#4) victim_name allocated by line 1169 (#3) is not freed, which willlead to a memory leak. There is a similar snippet of code in this functionas allocating a memory chunk for victim_name in line 1104 (#1) as well asreleasing the memory in line 1116 (#2). We should kfree() victim_name whenthe return value of backref_in_log() is less than zero and before thefunction returns in line 1184 (#4). 1057 static inline int__add_inode_ref(struct btrfs_trans_handle *trans, 1058 struct btrfs_root*root, 1059 struct btrfs_path *path, 1060 struct btrfs_root *log_root, 1061struct btrfs_inode *dir, 1062 struct btrfs_inode *inode, 1063 u64inode_objectid, u64 parent_objectid, 1064 u64 ref_index, char *name, intnamelen, 1065 int *search_done) 1066 { 1104 victim_name =kmalloc(victim_name_len, GFP_NOFS); // #1: kmalloc (victim_name-1) 1105 if(!victim_name) 1106 return -ENOMEM; 1112 ret = backref_in_log(log_root,&search_key, 1113 parent_objectid, victim_name, 1114 victim_name_len); 1115if (ret < 0) { 1116 kfree(victim_name); // #2: kfree (victim_name-1) 1117return ret; 1118 } else if (!ret) { 1169 victim_name =kmalloc(victim_name_len, GFP_NOFS); // #3: kmalloc (victim_name-2) 1170 if(!victim_name) 1171 return -ENOMEM; 1180 ret = backref_in_log(log_root,&search_key, 1181 parent_objectid, victim_name, 1182 victim_name_len); 1183if (ret < 0) { 1184 return ret; // #4: missing kfree (victim_name-2) 1185 }else if (!ret) { 1241 return 0; 1242 }\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47585` to fix the vulnerability.
