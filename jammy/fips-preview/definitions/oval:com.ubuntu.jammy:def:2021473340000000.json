		"title": "CVE-2021-47334 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-preview 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:misc/libmasm/module: Fix two use after free in ibmasm_init_one Inibmasm_init_one, it calls ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev(). Insideibmasm_init_remote_input_dev, mouse_dev and keybd_dev are allocated byinput_allocate_device(), and assigned to sp->remote.mouse_dev andsp->remote.keybd_dev respectively. In the err_free_devices error branch ofibmasm_init_one, mouse_dev and keybd_dev are freed by input_free_device(),and return error. Then the execution runs into error_send_message errorbranch of ibmasm_init_one, where ibmasm_free_remote_input_dev(sp) is calledto unregister the freed sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev. Mypatch add a \"error_init_remote\" label to handle the error ofibmasm_init_remote_input_dev(), to avoid the uaf bugs.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47334` to fix the vulnerability.
