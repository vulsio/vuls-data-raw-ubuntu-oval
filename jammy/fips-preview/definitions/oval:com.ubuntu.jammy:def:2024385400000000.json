		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bnxt_re: avoid shift undefined behavior in bnxt_qplib_alloc_init_hwqUndefined behavior is triggered when bnxt_qplib_alloc_init_hwq is calledwith hwq_attr->aux_depth != 0 and hwq_attr->aux_stride == 0. In that case,\"roundup_pow_of_two(hwq_attr->aux_stride)\" gets called. roundup_pow_of_twois documented as undefined for 0. Fix it in the one caller that had thiscombination.
