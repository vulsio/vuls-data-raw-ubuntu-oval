		"description": "GStreamer MXF File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code ExecutionVulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to executearbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction withthis library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectorsmay vary depending on the implementation. The specific flaw exists withinthe parsing of MXF video files. The issue results from the lack of propervalidation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflowbefore allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability toexecute code in the context of the current process.
