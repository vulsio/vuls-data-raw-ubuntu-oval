Afterthe binary-or in line 18, the verifier knows that bit 2 is set but knowsnothing about the rest of the content which was loaded from a map value,meaning, range is [2,0x7fffffff] with var_off=(0x2; 0x7ffffffd). When inline 19 the verifier analyzes the branch, it splits the register statesin reg_set_min_max() into the registers of the true branch (true_reg1,true_reg2) and the registers of the false branch (false_reg1, false_reg2).Since the test is w6 != 0x7ffffffd, the src_reg is a known constant.Internally, the verifier creates a \"fake\" register initialized as scalarto the value of 0x7ffffffd, and then passes it onto reg_set_min_max(). Now,for line 19, it is mathematically impossible to take the false branch ofthis program, yet the verifier analyzes it. It is impossible because thesecond bit of r6 will be set due to the prior or operation and theconstant in the condition has that bit unset (hex(fd) == binary(1111 1101).When the verifier first analyzes the false / fall-through branch, it willcompute an intersection between the var_off of r6 and of the constant. Thisis because the verifier creates a \"fake\" register initialized to the valueof the constant. The intersection result later refines both registers inregs_refine_cond_op():  [...]  t = tnum_intersect(tnum_subreg(reg1->var_off),tnum_subreg(reg2->var_off));  reg1->var_o---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41003` to fix the vulnerability.
