		"description": "A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers ina HTTP response to curl and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of them. Asufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent HTTP requests tothis, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests thatbecome larger than the threshold that curl uses internally to avoid sendingcrazy large requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error.Thisdenial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, matchand haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on`foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match for`bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a \"sister server\" toeffectively cause a denial of service for a sibling site on the same secondlevel domain using this method.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-32205` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.3\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.3\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.3\nlibcurl4 - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
