		"description": "An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repositorythat descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) aresource certificate containing a bit string that doesn't properly decodeinto a Subject Public Key. OpenSSL does not report this problem duringparsing, and when compiled with OpenSSL libcrypto versions below 3, Fortrecklessly dereferences the pointer. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party,a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can leadto compromised routing.",
