		"description": "Composer is a dependency Manager for the PHP language. In affected versionsseveral files within the local working directory are included during theinvocation of Composer and in the context of the executing user. As such,under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may lead to localprivilege escalation, provide lateral user movement or malicious codeexecution when Composer is invoked within a directory with tampered files.All Composer CLI commands are affected, including composer.phar'sself-update. The following scenarios are of high risk: Composer being runwith sudo, Pipelines which may execute Composer on untrusted projects,Shared environments with developers who run Composer individually on thesame project. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 2.7.0 and2.2.23. It is advised that the patched versions are applied at the earliestconvenience. Where not possible, the following should be addressed: Removeall sudo composer privileges for all users to mitigate root privilegeescalation, and avoid running Composer within an untrusted directory, or ifneeded, verify that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php`and `vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code. A resetcan also be done on these files by the following:```sh rmvendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.phpcomposer install --no-scripts --no-plugins ```",
