		"description": "Sydent is an identity server for the Matrix communications protocol. Priorto version 2.5.6, if configured to send emails using TLS, Sydent does notverify SMTP servers' certificates. This makes Sydent's emails vulnerable tointerception via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Attackers withprivileged access to the network can intercept room invitations and addressconfirmation emails. This is patched in Sydent 2.5.6. When patching, makesure that Sydent trusts the certificate of the server it is connecting to.This should happen automatically when using properly issued certificates.Those who use self-signed certificates should make sure to copy theirCertification Authority certificate, or their self signed certificate ifusing only one, to the trust store of your operating system. As aworkaround, one can ensure Sydent's emails fail to send by setting theconfigured SMTP server to a loopback or non-routable address under one'scontrol which does not have a listening SMTP server.",
