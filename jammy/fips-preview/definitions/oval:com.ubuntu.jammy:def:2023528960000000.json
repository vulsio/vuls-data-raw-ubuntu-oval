		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix race between quota rescan and disable leading to NULL pointerderefIf we have one task trying to start the quota rescan worker while anotherone is trying to disable quotas, we can end up hitting a race that resultsin the quota rescan worker doing a NULL pointer dereference. The steps forthis are the following:1) Quotas are enabled;2) Task A calls the quota rescan ioctl and enters btrfs_qgroup_rescan().   It calls qgroup_rescan_init() which returns 0 (success) and then joins a   transaction and commits it;3) Task B calls the quota disable ioctl and enters btrfs_quota_disable().   It clears the bit BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED from fs_info->flags and calls   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which returns immediately since the   rescan worker is not yet running.   Then it starts a transaction and locks fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock;4) Task A queues the rescan worker, by calling btrfs_queue_work();5) The rescan worker starts, and calls rescan_should_stop() at the start   of its while loop, which results in 0 iterations of the loop, since   the flag BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED was cleared from fs_info->flags by   task B at step 3);6) Task B sets fs_info->quota_root to NULL;7) The rescan worker tries to start a transaction and uses   fs_info->quota_root as the root argument for btrfs_start_transaction().   This results in a NULL pointer dereference down the call chain of   btrfs_start_transaction(). The stack trace is something like the one   reported in Link tag below:   general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address0xdffffc0000000041: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN   KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000208-0x000000000000020f]   CPU: 1 PID: 34 Comm: kworker/u4:2 Not tainted6.1.0-syzkaller-13872-gb6bb9676f216 #0   Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 10/26/2022   Workqueue: btrfs-qgroup-rescan btrfs_work_helper   RIP: 0010:start_transaction+0x48/0x10f0 fs/btrfs/transaction.c:564   Code: 48 89 fb 48 (...)
