If suspend is triggered, firmware will be reloadedduring resume. As same as before, firmware requests two large segments atfirst. In ath12k_qmi_msg_mem_request_cb() segment count and size areassigned:\tab->qmi.mem_seg_count == 2\tab->qmi.target_mem[0].size == 7077888\tab->qmi.target_mem[1].size == 8454144Then allocation failed like before and ath12k_qmi_free_target_mem_chunk()is called to free all allocated segments. Note the first segment is skippedbecause its v.addr is cleared due to allocation failure:\tchunk->v.addr = dma_alloc_coherent()Also note that this leaks that segment because it has not been freed.While freeing the second segment, a size of 8454144 is passed todma_free_coherent(). However remember that this segment is allocated atthe first time firmware is loaded, before suspend. So its real size is524288, much smaller than 8454144. As a result kernel found we are freeingsome memory which is in use and thus cras---truncated---",
