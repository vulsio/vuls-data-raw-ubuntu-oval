		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/cma: Do not change route.addr.src_addr outside state checksIf the state is not idle then resolve_prepare_src() should immediatelyfail and no change to global state should happen. However, itunconditionally overwrites the src_addr trying to build a temporary anyaddress.For instance if the state is already RDMA_CM_LISTEN then this will corruptthe src_addr and would cause the test in cma_cancel_operation():           if (cma_any_addr(cma_src_addr(id_priv)) && !id_priv->cma_dev)Which would manifest as this trace from syzkaller:  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __list_add_valid+0x93/0xa0lib/list_debug.c:26  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8881546491e0 by task syz-executor.1/32204  CPU: 1 PID: 32204 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 5.12.0-rc8-syzkaller#0  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 01/01/2011  Call Trace:   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:79 [inline]   dump_stack+0x141/0x1d7 lib/dump_stack.c:120   print_address_description.constprop.0.cold+0x5b/0x2f8mm/kasan/report.c:232   __kasan_report mm/kasan/report.c:399 [inline]   kasan_report.cold+0x7c/0xd8 mm/kasan/report.c:416   __list_add_valid+0x93/0xa0 lib/list_debug.c:26   __list_add include/linux/list.h:67 [inline]   list_add_tail include/linux/list.h:100 [inline]   cma_listen_on_all drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c:2557 [inline]   rdma_listen+0x787/0xe00 drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c:3751   ucma_listen+0x16a/0x210 drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c:1102   ucma_write+0x259/0x350 drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c:1732   vfs_write+0x28e/0xa30 fs/read_write.c:603   ksys_write+0x1ee/0x250 fs/read_write.c:658   do_syscall_64+0x2d/0x70 arch/x86/entry/common.c:46   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xaeThis is indicating that an rdma_id_private was destroyed without doingcma_cancel_listens().Instead of trying to re-use the src_addr memory to indirectly create anany address derived from the dst build one explicitly on the stack andbind to that as any other normal flow would do. rdma_bind_addr() will copyit over the src_addr once it knows the state is valid.This is similar to commit bc0bdc5afaa7 (\"RDMA/cma: Do not changeroute.addr.src_addr.ss_family\")\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48925` to fix the vulnerability.
