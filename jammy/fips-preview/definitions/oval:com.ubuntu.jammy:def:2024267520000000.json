		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: l2tp:pass correct message length to ip6_append_data l2tp_ip6_sendmsg needs toavoid accounting for the transport header twice when splicing more datainto an already partially-occupied skbuff. To manage this, we check whetherthe skbuff contains data using skb_queue_empty when deciding how much datato append using ip6_append_data. However, the code which performed thecalculation was incorrect: ulen = len +skb_queue_empty(&sk->sk_write_queue) ? transhdrlen : 0; ...due to Coperator precedence, this ends up setting ulen to transhdrlen for messageswith a non-zero length, which results in corrupted packets on the wire. Addparentheses to correct the calculation in line with the original intent.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26752` to fix the vulnerability.
