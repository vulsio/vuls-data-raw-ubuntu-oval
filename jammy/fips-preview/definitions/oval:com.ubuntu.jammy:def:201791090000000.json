		"description": "An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It fails to ignore apparentanswers before the first RR that was found the first time. when this isfixed, the second answer scan finds the same RRs at the first. Otherwise,adns can be confused by interleaving answers for the CNAME target, with theCNAME itself. In that case the answer data structure (on the heap) can beoverrun. With this fixed, it prefers to look only at the answer RRs whichcome after the CNAME, which is at least arguably correct.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-9109` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nadns-tools - 1.6.0-2\nlibadns1 - 1.6.0-2\nNo subscription required",
