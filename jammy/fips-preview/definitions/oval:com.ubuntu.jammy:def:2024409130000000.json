		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cachefiles: defer exposing anon_fd until after copy_to_user() succeedsAfter installing the anonymous fd, we can now see it in userland and closeit. However, at this point we may not have gotten the reference count ofthe cache, but we will put it during colse fd, so this may cause a cacheUAF.So grab the cache reference count before fd_install(). In addition, bykernel convention, fd is taken over by the user land after fd_install(),and the kernel should not call close_fd() after that, i.e., it should callfd_install() after everything is ready, thus fd_install() is called aftercopy_to_user() succeeds.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40913` to fix the vulnerability.
