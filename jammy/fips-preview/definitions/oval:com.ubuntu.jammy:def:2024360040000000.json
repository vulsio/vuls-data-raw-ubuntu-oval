		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i40e:Do not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag for workqueue Issue reported by customerduring SRIOV testing, call trace: When both i40e and the i40iw driver areloaded, a warning in check_flush_dependency is being triggered. This seemsto be because of the i40e driver workqueue is allocated with theWQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag, and the i40iw one is not. Similar error wasencountered on ice too and it was fixed by removing the flag. Do the samefor i40e too.
