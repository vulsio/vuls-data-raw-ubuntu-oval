Due to the different implementations depending on thearchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarchplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platformfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root causeis that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():\tshutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and nopage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this emptysge is queued into ingress_msg list.And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got bysg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes itto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invokingcopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered bycopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41048` to fix the vulnerability.
