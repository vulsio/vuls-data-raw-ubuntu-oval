		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ecryptfs: Fix buffer size for tag 66 packet The 'TAG 66 Packet Format'description is missing the cipher code and checksum fields that are packedinto the message packet. As a result, the buffer allocated for the packetis 3 bytes too small and write_tag_66_packet() will write up to 3 bytespast the end of the buffer. Fix this by increasing the size of theallocation so the whole packet will always fit in the buffer.
