The aboveadded iommu_device structure to pci_controller. During system boot, PCIdevices are discovered and this newly added iommu_device structure isinitialized by a call to iommu_device_register(). During DLPAR add of a PCIdevice, a new pci_controller structure is allocated but there are no callsmade to iommu_device_register() interface. Fix is to register the iommudevice during DLPAR add as well.
