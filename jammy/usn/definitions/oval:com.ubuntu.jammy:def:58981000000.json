		"description": "It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not properly handle the deserialization of some CORBA objects. An attacker could possibly use this to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2023-21830)  Markus Loewe discovered that the Java Sound subsystem in OpenJDK did not properly validate the origin of a Soundbank.
