		"description": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1281)  It was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2 VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)  It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-27672)  Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4382)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-4842)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0394)  It was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1073)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-1074)  It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)  It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)  Lianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions, leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26545)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5978-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-buildinfo-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-oem-6.1-tools-6.1.0-1008 - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-modules-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-modules-ipu6-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-oem-6.1-headers-6.1.0-1008 - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-tools-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-headers-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-oem-6.1-tools-host - 6.1.0-1008.8 linux-modules-ivsc-6.1.0-1008-oem - 6.1.0-1008.8 No subscription required  linux-modules-ipu6-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1008.8 linux-headers-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1008.8 linux-image-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1008.8 linux-modules-ivsc-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1008.8 linux-tools-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1008.8 linux-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1008.8 No subscription required",
