(CVE-2022-1619)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing memory management when dealing with invalid regular expression patterns in buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1620)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing invalid bytes when performing spell check operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1621)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5613-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  vim-common - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-athena - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 xxd - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-gtk - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-gui-common - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-doc - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-tiny - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-runtime - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-gtk3 - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 vim-nox - 2:8.2.3995-1ubuntu2.1 No subscription required",
