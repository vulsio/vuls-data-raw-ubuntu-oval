		"description": "It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1076)  It was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1077)  It was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1079)  It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1670)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer implementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1859)  Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2 mitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1998)  It was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-25012)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the HFS+ file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2985)  Hangyu Hua discovered that the Flower classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35788, LP: #2023577)  It was discovered that for some Intel processors the INVLPG instruction implementation did not properly flush global TLB entries when PCIDs are enabled. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or possibly cause undesired behaviors. (LP: #2023220)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6223-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.15.0-1041-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1041.48.1 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1041.48.1 No subscription required  linux-azure-fde - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-modules-extra-azure-fde - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-tools-azure-fde-lts-22.04 - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-image-azure-fde - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-azure-fde-lts-22.04 - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-headers-azure-fde-lts-22.04 - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-cloud-tools-azure-fde-lts-22.04 - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-tools-azure-fde - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-cloud-tools-azure-fde - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-image-azure-fde-lts-22.04 - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-modules-extra-azure-fde-lts-22.04 - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 linux-headers-azure-fde - 5.15.0.1041.48.19 No subscription required",
