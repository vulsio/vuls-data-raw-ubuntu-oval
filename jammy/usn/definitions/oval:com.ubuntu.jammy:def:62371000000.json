		"description": "Hiroki Kurosawa discovered that curl incorrectly handled validating certain certificate wildcards. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof certain website certificates using IDN hosts. (CVE-2023-28321)  Hiroki Kurosawa discovered that curl incorrectly handled callbacks when certain options are set by applications. This could cause applications using curl to misbehave, resulting in information disclosure, or a denial of service. (CVE-2023-28322)  It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled saving cookies to files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to create or overwrite files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10, and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-32001)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6237-1` to fix the vulnerability.
