		"description": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in certain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)  It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some RPC messages, leading to a buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43945)  Tamás Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP handshake implementation in the Linux kernel contained multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42896)  It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)  It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4379)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-45934)  It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-47520)  José Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)  It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0469)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5914-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-image-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-modules-iwlwifi-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-modules-ivsc-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-modules-ipu6-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-headers-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-oem-6.0-tools-host - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-tools-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-buildinfo-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-oem-6.0-tools-6.0.0-1012 - 6.0.0-1012.12 linux-oem-6.0-headers-6.0.0-1012 - 6.0.0-1012.12 No subscription required  linux-modules-ipu6-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1012.12 linux-headers-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1012.12 linux-image-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1012.12 linux-modules-ivsc-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1012.12 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1012.12 linux-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1012.12 linux-tools-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1012.12 No subscription required",
