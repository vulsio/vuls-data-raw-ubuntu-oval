		"description": "It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled TLSv1.3 sessions when certain non-default TLS server configurations were in use. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2024-2511)  It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-4603)  William Ahern discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain memory operations in a rarely-used API. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-4741)  Joseph Birr-Pixton discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled calling a certain API with an empty supported client protocols buffer. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information, or cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2024-5535)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6937-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl-dev - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17 libssl-doc - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17 libssl3 - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17 openssl - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17 No subscription required",
