		"description": "Zhenpeng Lin discovered that the network packet scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly remove all references to a route filter before freeing it in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2588)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not prevent one nft object from referencing an nft set in another nft table, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2586)  It was discovered that the implementation of POSIX timers in the Linux kernel did not properly clean up timers in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2585)  It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent writes to kernel objects in BPF_BTF_LOAD commands. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0500)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)  It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1679)  It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)  Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1789)  Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1974)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic context operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1975)  Felix Fu discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket states, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-28893)  Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some AMD x86-64 processors, the branch predictor could by mis-trained for return instructions in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29900)  Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64 processors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29901)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-33981)  Arthur Mongodin discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data validation. A local attacker could use this to escalate privileges in certain situations. (CVE-2022-34918)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5564-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-common - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-intel-iotg-tools-5.15.0-1013 - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-modules-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-headers-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1013 - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-intel-iotg-tools-host - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-image-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-intel-iotg-tools-common - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-intel-iotg-headers-5.15.0-1013 - 5.15.0-1013.17 linux-tools-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17 No subscription required  linux-tools-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1013.13 linux-headers-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1013.13 linux-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1013.13 linux-image-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1013.13 No subscription required",
