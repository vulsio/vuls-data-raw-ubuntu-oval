		"description": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for the TCINDEX classifier has been removed. (CVE-2023-1829)  Lin Ma discovered a race condition in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0468)  It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-0386)  David Hildenbrand discovered that a race condition existed in the memory manager of the Linux kernel when handling copy-on-write with shared memory pages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2590)  It was discovered that the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3303)  Gwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3586)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the EFI capsule loader driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-40307)  Zheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang discovered that the RealTek RTL8712U wireless driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4095)  It was discovered that the USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle nested reset events. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4662)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer implementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1859)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23455)  Lianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions, leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26545)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6071-1` to fix the vulnerability.
