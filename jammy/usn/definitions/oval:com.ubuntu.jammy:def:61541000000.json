(CVE-2023-2426)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks when processing register contents, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-2609)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly limiting the length of substitution expression strings, which could lead to excessive memory consumption. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-2610)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6154-1` to fix the vulnerability.
