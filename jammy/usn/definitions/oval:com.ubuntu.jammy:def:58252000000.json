		"description": "USN-5825-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PAM. Unfortunately that update was incomplete and could introduce a regression. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that PAM did not correctly restrict login from an IP  address that is not resolvable via DNS. An attacker could possibly use this  issue to bypass authentication.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5825-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libpam-runtime - 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.3 libpam0g-dev - 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.3 libpam-modules - 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.3 libpam-modules-bin - 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.3 libpam-doc - 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.3 libpam-cracklib - 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.3 libpam0g - 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.3 No subscription required",
