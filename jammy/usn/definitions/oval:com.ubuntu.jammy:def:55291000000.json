		"description": "It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1679)  Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1789)  Qiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle an illegal instruction in a guest, resulting in a null pointer dereference. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1852)  Gerald Lee discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1973)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2078)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform cleanup actions on multi-core shared buffers. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21123)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform cleanup actions on microarchitectural fill buffers. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21125)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly perform cleanup during specific special register write operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21166)  It was discovered that the virtio RPMSG bus driver in the Linux kernel contained a double-free vulnerability in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-34494, CVE-2022-34495)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5529-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-oem-5.17-tools-5.17.0-1013 - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-oem-5.17-headers-5.17.0-1013 - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-headers-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-tools-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-image-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-buildinfo-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-modules-5.17.0-1013-oem - 5.17.0-1013.14 linux-oem-5.17-tools-host - 5.17.0-1013.14 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-headers-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-image-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-tools-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-tools-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1013.12 linux-headers-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1013.12 No subscription required",
