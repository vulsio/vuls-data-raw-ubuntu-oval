		"description": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for the TCINDEX classifier has been removed. (CVE-2023-1829)  William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)  Thadeu Cascardo discovered that the io_uring subsystem contained a double- free vulnerability in certain memory allocation error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1032)  It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1076)  It was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1077)  It was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1079)  It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform file table updates in some situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1583)  It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1670)  It was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1855)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth HCI SDIO driver, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1989)  It was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1990)  Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2 mitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1998)  It was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-25012)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-28466)  It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize some data structures, leading to an out-of-bounds access vulnerability in certain situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-28866)  Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2023-30456)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1118)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6033-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-headers-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-modules-ivsc-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-oem-6.1-tools-6.1.0-1009 - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-image-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-tools-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-oem-6.1-headers-6.1.0-1009 - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-oem-6.1-tools-host - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-buildinfo-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-modules-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 linux-modules-ipu6-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9 No subscription required  linux-modules-ipu6-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1009.9 linux-headers-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1009.9 linux-image-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1009.9 linux-modules-ivsc-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1009.9 linux-tools-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1009.9 linux-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1009.9 No subscription required",
