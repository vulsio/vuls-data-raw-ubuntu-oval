		"description": "It was discovered that Tornado incorrectly handled a certain redirect. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to redirect a user to an arbitrary web site and conduct a phishing attack by having the user access a specially crafted URL. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS was previously addressed in USN-6159-1. (CVE-2023-28370)  It was discovered that Tornado inefficiently handled requests when parsing cookies. An attacker could possibly use this issue to increase resource utilization leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2024-52804)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7150-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-tornado-doc - 6.1.0-3ubuntu0.1~esm1 python3-tornado - 6.1.0-3ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
