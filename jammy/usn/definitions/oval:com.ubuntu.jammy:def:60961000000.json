		"description": "It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-27672)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36280)  Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)  Haowei Yan discovered that a race condition existed in the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-4129)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-4842)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-48423)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48424)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0210)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations.
