		"description": "It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-4842)  Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)  Seth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform address randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2023-0597)  It was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1073)  It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain images. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2124)  Wei Chen discovered that the InfiniBand RDMA communication manager implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2176)  Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking when IOPOLL mode is being used. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2430)  Hangyu Hua discovered that the Flower classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35788, LP: #2023577)  It was discovered that for some Intel processors the INVLPG instruction implementation did not properly flush global TLB entries when PCIDs are enabled. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or possibly cause undesired behaviors. (LP: #2023220)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6235-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-modules-ipu6-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-buildinfo-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-headers-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-modules-iwlwifi-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-modules-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-modules-ivsc-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-oem-6.0-tools-6.0.0-1019 - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-oem-6.0-tools-host - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-tools-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19 linux-oem-6.0-headers-6.0.0-1019 - 6.0.0-1019.19 No subscription required  linux-headers-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1019.19 linux-modules-ipu6-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1019.19 linux-tools-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1019.19 linux-image-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1019.19 linux-modules-ivsc-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1019.19 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1019.19 linux-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1019.19 No subscription required",
