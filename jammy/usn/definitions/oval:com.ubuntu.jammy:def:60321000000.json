		"description": "Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36280)  Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4382)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-1074)  It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)  It was discovered that the file system writeback functionality in the Linux kernel contained a user-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26605)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-26607)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1118)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6032-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-ivsc-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-image-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-tools-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-buildinfo-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-modules-iwlwifi-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-oem-6.0-tools-host - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-oem-6.0-headers-6.0.0-1014 - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-modules-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-oem-6.0-tools-6.0.0-1014 - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-headers-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 linux-modules-ipu6-6.0.0-1014-oem - 6.0.0-1014.14 No subscription required  linux-headers-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1014.14 linux-modules-ipu6-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1014.14 linux-image-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1014.14 linux-modules-ivsc-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1014.14 linux-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1014.14 linux-tools-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1014.14 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04b - 6.0.0.1014.14 No subscription required",
