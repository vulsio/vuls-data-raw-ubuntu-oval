		"description": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in certain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)  Davide Ornaghi discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle VLAN headers in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0179)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36280)  Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)  Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41218)  It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4379)  It was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-47929)  Jos√© Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0210)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the class-based queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23454)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23455)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5915-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-modules-ivsc-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-tools-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-oem-6.1-tools-6.1.0-1007 - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-buildinfo-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-oem-6.1-tools-host - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-oem-6.1-headers-6.1.0-1007 - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-headers-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-image-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 linux-modules-ipu6-6.1.0-1007-oem - 6.1.0-1007.7 No subscription required  linux-modules-ipu6-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1007.7 linux-headers-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1007.7 linux-image-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1007.7 linux-modules-ivsc-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1007.7 linux-tools-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1007.7 linux-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1007.7 No subscription required",
