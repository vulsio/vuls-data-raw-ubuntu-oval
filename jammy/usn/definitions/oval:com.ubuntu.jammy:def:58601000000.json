		"description": "Kyle Zeng discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4378)  Tamás Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP handshake implementation in the Linux kernel contained multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42896)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Unix domain socket implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3543)  It was discovered that the Bluetooth HCI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3619)  It was discovered that the hugetlb implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-3623)  It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3628)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth stack in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3640)  It was discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle packets structured in certain ways. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host NIC availability). (CVE-2022-3643)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the SMSC UFX USB driver implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41849)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Roccat HID driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41850)  Tamás Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-42895)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-45934)  Arnaud Gatignol, Quentin Minster, Florent Saudel and Guillaume Teissier discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate user-supplied data in some situations. An authenticated attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-47940)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0590)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5860-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-gke-tools-5.15.0-1027 - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-image-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-tools-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-gke-headers-5.15.0-1027 - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-headers-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-modules-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32 No subscription required  linux-image-gke - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-headers-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-tools-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-image-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-headers-gke - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-gke - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-tools-gke - 5.15.0.1027.26 No subscription required",
