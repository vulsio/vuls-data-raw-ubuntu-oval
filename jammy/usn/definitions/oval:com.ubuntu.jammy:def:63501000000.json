		"description": "It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate MFT flags in certain situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious NTFS image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-48425)  Zi Fan Tan discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-21255)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2898)  It was discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking events in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2023-31084)  Yang Lan discovered that the GFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious GFS2 image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3212)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an out-of- bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-38426, CVE-2023-38428)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate the size of certain buffers. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-38429)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6350-1` to fix the vulnerability.
