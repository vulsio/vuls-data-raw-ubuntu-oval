		"description": "Tony Battersby discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled key and initialization vector (IV) lengths. This could lead to truncation issues and result in loss of confidentiality for some symmetric cipher modes. (CVE-2023-5363)  Juerg Wullschleger discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the AES-SIV cipher. This could lead to empty data entries being ignored, resulting in certain applications being misled. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-2975)  It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled checking excessively long DH keys or parameters. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-3446, CVE-2023-3817)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6450-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl-dev - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.12 openssl - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.12 libssl-doc - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.12 libssl3 - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.12 No subscription required",
