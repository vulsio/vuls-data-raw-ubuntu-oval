		"description": "David Bouman and Billy Jheng Bing Jhong discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2602)  Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling implementation of the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)  Hao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2978)  Abhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-3028)  Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX storage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-40768)  Sönke Huster discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41674)  Sönke Huster discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42719)  Sönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42720)  Sönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly handle BSSID/SSID lists in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2022-42721)  Sönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-42722)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5693-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-buildinfo-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-headers-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-oem-5.17-headers-5.17.0-1020 - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-oem-5.17-tools-host - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-image-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-oem-5.17-tools-5.17.0-1020 - 5.17.0-1020.21 linux-tools-5.17.0-1020-oem - 5.17.0-1020.21 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-headers-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-image-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-tools-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-tools-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-oem-22.04a - 5.17.0.1020.19 linux-headers-oem-22.04 - 5.17.0.1020.19 No subscription required",
