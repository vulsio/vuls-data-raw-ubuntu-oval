		"description": "It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1076)  It was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1077)  It was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1079)  It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1670)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer implementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1859)  Jose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2 mitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1998)  It was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-25012)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the HFS+ file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2985)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6207-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-common - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-intel-iotg-tools-5.15.0-1033 - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-tools-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-image-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-intel-iotg-headers-5.15.0-1033 - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-modules-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-headers-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-intel-iotg-tools-host - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-intel-iotg-tools-common - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38 linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1033 - 5.15.0-1033.38 No subscription required  linux-tools-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1033.32 linux-headers-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1033.32 linux-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1033.32 linux-image-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1033.32 No subscription required",
