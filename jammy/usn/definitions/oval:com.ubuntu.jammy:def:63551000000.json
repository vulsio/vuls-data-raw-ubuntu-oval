		"description": "Daniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted images could cause a heap-based out-of-bonds write. A local attacker could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2021-3695)  Daniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted images could cause out-of-bonds read and write. A local attacker could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2021-3696)  Daniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted images could cause buffer underwrite which allows arbitrary data to be written to a heap. A local attacker could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2021-3697)  It was discovered that GRUB2 configuration files were created with the wrong permissions. An attacker could possibly use this to leak encrypted passwords. (CVE-2021-3981)  Daniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted IP packets could cause an integer underflow and write past the end of a buffer. An attacker could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-28733)  Daniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted HTTP headers can cause an out-of-bounds write of a NULL byte. An attacker could possibly use this to corrupt GRUB2's internal data. (CVE-2022-28734)  Julian Andres Klode discovered that GRUB2 shim_lock allowed non- kernel files to be loaded. A local attack could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-28735)  Chris Coulson discovered that executing chainloaders more than once caused a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attack could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-28736)  Chris Coulson discovered that specially crafted executables could cause shim to make out-of-bound writes. A local attack could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-28737)  Zhang Boyang discovered that specially crafted unicode sequences could lead to an out-of-bounds write to a heap. A local attacker could possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-3775)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6355-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  grub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.187.3~22.04.1+2.06-2ubuntu14.1 grub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.187.3~22.04.1+2.06-2ubuntu14.1 No subscription required  shim-signed - 1.51.3+15.7-0ubuntu1 No subscription required  shim - 15.7-0ubuntu1 No subscription required  grub-efi-amd64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1 grub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1 grub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1 grub-efi-arm64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1 No subscription required",
