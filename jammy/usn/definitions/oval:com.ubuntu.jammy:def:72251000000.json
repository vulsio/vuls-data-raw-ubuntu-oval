		"description": "It was discovered that HTMLDOC incorrectly handled memory in the image_set_mask, git_read_lzw, write_header and write_node functions, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-0137, CVE-2022-24191, CVE-2022-34033, CVE-2022-34035)  It was discovered that HTMLDOC incorrectly handled memory in the gif_get_code function, which could lead to a segmentation fault. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted GIF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-0534)  It was discovered that HTMLDOC did not perform proper bounds checks on image dimensions when loading JPEG images, which could lead to a buffer overflow. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted JPEG image, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-27114)  It was discovered that HTMLDOC incorrectly handled memory in the pdf_write_names function, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. If a user or application were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or leak sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-28085)  It was discovered that HTMLDOC could be made to write out of bounds when attempting to strip whitespace. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-45508)  It was discovered that HTMLDOC incorrectly handled memory in the parse_pre function, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. If a user or application were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-46478)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7225-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  htmldoc - 1.9.15-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 htmldoc-common - 1.9.15-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
