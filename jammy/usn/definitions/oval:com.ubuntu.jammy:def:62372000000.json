		"description": "USN-6237-1 fixed vulnerabilities in curl. The update caused a certificate wildcard handling regression on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Hiroki Kurosawa discovered that curl incorrectly handled validating certain  certificate wildcards. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to  spoof certain website certificates using IDN hosts. (CVE-2023-28321)    Hiroki Kurosawa discovered that curl incorrectly handled callbacks when  certain options are set by applications. This could cause applications  using curl to misbehave, resulting in information disclosure, or a denial  of service. (CVE-2023-28322)    It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled saving cookies to files. A  local attacker could possibly use this issue to create or overwrite files.  This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10, and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-32001)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6237-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  curl - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 libcurl3-gnutls - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 libcurl3-nss - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 libcurl4 - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 libcurl4-doc - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13 No subscription required",
