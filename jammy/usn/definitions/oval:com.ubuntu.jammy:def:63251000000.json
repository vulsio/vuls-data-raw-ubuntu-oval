		"description": "Daniel Moghimi discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly clear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various instructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to sensitive information. (CVE-2022-40982)  Tavis Ormandy discovered that some AMD processors did not properly handle speculative execution of certain vector register instructions. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20593)  Ye Zhang and Nicolas Wu discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking for rings with IOPOLL, leading to a double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-21400)  It was discovered that the universal 32bit network packet classifier implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3609)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3610)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing network scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3611)  It was discovered that the network packet classifier with netfilter/firewall marks implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3776)  Kevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle table rules flush in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3777)  Kevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rule additions to bound chains in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3995)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle PIPAPO element removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4004)  Kevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bound chain deactivation in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4015)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6325-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-common - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-image-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-headers-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-intel-iotg-tools-5.15.0-1038 - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1038 - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-intel-iotg-headers-5.15.0-1038 - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-tools-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-intel-iotg-tools-host - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-intel-iotg-tools-common - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-modules-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43 No subscription required  linux-tools-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1038.37 linux-headers-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1038.37 linux-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1038.37 linux-image-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1038.37 No subscription required",
