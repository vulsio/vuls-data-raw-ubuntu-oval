		"description": "It was discovered that Rack was not properly parsing data when processing multipart POST requests. If a user or automated system were tricked into sending a specially crafted multipart POST request to an application using Rack, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-30122)  It was discovered that Rack was not properly escaping untrusted data when performing logging operations, which could cause shell escaped sequences to be written to a terminal. If a user or automated system were tricked into sending a specially crafted request to an application using Rack, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code in the machine running the application. (CVE-2022-30123)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5896-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ruby-rack - 2.1.4-5ubuntu1+esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
