		"description": "USN-5736-1 fixed vulnerabilities in ImageMagick. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 20.04 ESM and Ubuntu 22.04 ESM. One of the issues, CVE-2021-20224, only affected Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, while CVE-2021-20245, CVE-2021-3574, CVE-2021-4219 and CVE-2022-1114 only affected Ubuntu 22.04 ESM.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values  when processing PDF files. If a user or automated system using ImageMagick  were tricked into opening a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker could  exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu  14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-20224)    Zhang Xiaohui discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain  values when processing image data. If a user or automated system using  ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an  attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only  affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20241)    Zhang Xiaohui discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain  values when processing image data. If a user or automated system using  ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an  attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only  affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10.  (CVE-2021-20243)    It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values  when processing visual effects based image files. By tricking a user into  opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could crash the  application causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu  22.10. (CVE-2021-20244)    It was discovered that ImageMagick could be made to divide by zero when  processing crafted files. By tricking a user into opening a specially  crafted image file, an attacker could crash the application causing a  denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20245)    It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values  when performing resampling operations.
