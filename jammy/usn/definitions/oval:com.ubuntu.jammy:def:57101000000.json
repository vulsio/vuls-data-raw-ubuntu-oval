		"description": "It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain X.509 Email Addresses. If a certificate authority were tricked into signing a specially-crafted certificate, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The default compiler options for affected releases reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. (CVE-2022-3602, CVE-2022-3786)  It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled applications creating custom ciphers via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function. This issue could cause certain applications that mishandled values to the function to possibly end up with a NULL cipher and messages in plaintext. (CVE-2022-3358)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5710-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl-dev - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.7 openssl - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.7 libssl-doc - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.7 libssl3 - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.7 No subscription required",
