		"description": "It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48502)  Stonejiajia, Shir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-2640)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2898)  Mingi Cho discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the status of a nft chain while performing a lookup by id, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-31248)  Shir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-32629)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3390)  Tanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35001)  It was discovered that the universal 32bit network packet classifier implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3609)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3610)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing network scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3611)  It was discovered that the network packet classifier with netfilter/firewall marks implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3776)  Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SMB request protocol IDs, leading to a out-of- bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38430)  Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate command payload size, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38432)  It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication in certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6285-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-tools-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-oem-6.1-tools-6.1.0-1019 - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-modules-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-modules-ivsc-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-modules-iwlwifi-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-oem-6.1-headers-6.1.0-1019 - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-headers-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-modules-ipu6-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-image-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-buildinfo-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19 linux-oem-6.1-tools-host - 6.1.0-1019.19 No subscription required  linux-modules-ipu6-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1019.19 linux-headers-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1019.19 linux-image-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1019.19 linux-modules-ivsc-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1019.19 linux-tools-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1019.19 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1019.19 linux-oem-22.04c - 6.1.0.1019.19 No subscription required",
