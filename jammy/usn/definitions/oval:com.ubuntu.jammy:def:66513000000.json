		"description": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51780)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)  Zhenghan Wang discovered that the generic ID allocator implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for null bitmap when releasing IDs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6915)  Robert Morris discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain server commands fields, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-0565)  Jann Horn discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle the release of certain buffer rings. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0582)  Jann Horn discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle spliced messages, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0646)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6651-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-6.5.0-1008-starfive - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 linux-headers-6.5.0-1008-starfive - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 linux-buildinfo-6.5.0-1008-starfive - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-1008-starfive - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 linux-modules-6.5.0-1008-starfive - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 linux-starfive-6.5-tools-6.5.0-1008 - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 linux-tools-6.5.0-1008-starfive - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 linux-starfive-6.5-headers-6.5.0-1008 - 6.5.0-1008.9~22.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-starfive - 6.5.0.1008.9~22.04.3 linux-starfive - 6.5.0.1008.9~22.04.3 linux-tools-starfive - 6.5.0.1008.9~22.04.3 linux-headers-starfive - 6.5.0.1008.9~22.04.3 No subscription required",
