		"description": "Jay Satiro discovered that curl incorrectly handled hostnames when using a SOCKS5 proxy. In environments where curl is configured to use a SOCKS5 proxy, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-38545)  It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled cookies when an application duplicated certain handles. A local attacker could possibly create a cookie file and inject arbitrary cookies into subsequent connections. (CVE-2023-38546)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6429-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 libcurl3-gnutls - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 libcurl4-doc - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 libcurl3-nss - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 libcurl4 - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 curl - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.14 No subscription required",
