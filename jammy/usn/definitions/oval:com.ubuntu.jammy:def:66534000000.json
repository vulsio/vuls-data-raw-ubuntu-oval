		"description": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51780)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)  Zhenghan Wang discovered that the generic ID allocator implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for null bitmap when releasing IDs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6915)  Robert Morris discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain server commands fields, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-0565)  Jann Horn discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle spliced messages, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0646)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6653-4` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-gke-tools-5.15.0-1051 - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-headers-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-modules-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-image-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-tools-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-gke-headers-5.15.0-1051 - 5.15.0-1051.56 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-gke - 5.15.0-1051.56 No subscription required  linux-image-gke - 5.15.0.1051.50 linux-headers-gke - 5.15.0.1051.50 linux-headers-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1051.50 linux-image-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1051.50 linux-tools-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1051.50 linux-gke - 5.15.0.1051.50 linux-gke-5.15 - 5.15.0.1051.50 linux-tools-gke - 5.15.0.1051.50 No subscription required",
