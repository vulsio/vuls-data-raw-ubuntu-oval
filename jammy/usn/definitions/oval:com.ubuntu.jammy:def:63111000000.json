		"description": "William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48502)  Seth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform address randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2023-0597)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1611)  It was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1855)  It was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1990)  Ruihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (bluetooth communication). (CVE-2023-2002)  It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain images. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2124)  Juan Jose Lopez Jaimez, Meador Inge, Simon Scannell, and Nenad Stojanovski discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly mark registers for precision tracking in certain situations, leading to an out- of-bounds access vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-2163)  It was discovered that the SLIMpro I2C device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate user-supplied data in some situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-2194)  It was discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-2235)  Zheng Zhang discovered that the device-mapper implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking during table_clear() operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2023-2269)  It was discovered that the ARM Mali Display Processor driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23004)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-28466)  It was discovered that the DA9150 charger driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-30772)  It was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3141)  Quentin Minster discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate pointers in some situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-32248)  It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform certain buffer calculations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3268)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm EMAC ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-33203)  It was discovered that the BQ24190 charger driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-33288)  It was discovered that the video4linux driver for Philips based TV cards in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35823)  It was discovered that the SDMC DM1105 PCI device driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35824)  It was discovered that the Renesas USB controller driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability.
