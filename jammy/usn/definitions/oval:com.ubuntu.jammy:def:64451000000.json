		"description": "It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a high rate of hash collisions in connection lookup table. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive CPU consumption). (CVE-2023-1206)  Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi discovered that some AMD processors utilising speculative execution and branch prediction may allow unauthorised memory reads via a speculative side-channel attack. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. (CVE-2023-20569)  It was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle user-supplied data. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2156)  Davide Ornaghi discovered that the DECnet network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. Please note that kernel support for the DECnet has been removed to resolve this CVE. (CVE-2023-3338)  Ross Lagerwall discovered that the Xen netback backend driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain unusual packets from a paravirtualized network frontend, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-34319)  Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate command payload size, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38432)  It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication in certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)  Laurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate a buffer size in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-3865)  Laurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability when handling handling chained requests. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3866)  It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4132)  Andy Nguyen discovered that the KVM implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel with Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) contained a race condition when accessing the GHCB page. A local attacker in a SEV guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2023-4155)  It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4194)  Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4244)  Maxim Suhanov discovered that the exFAT file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check a file name length, leading to an out- of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious exFAT image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4273)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the networking stack implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate skb object size in certain conditions. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42752)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate array offsets, leading to a out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42753)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). Please note that kernel packet classifier support for RSVP has been removed to resolve this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-42755)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in IP set operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42756)  Thelford Williams discovered that the Ceph file system messenger protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate frame segment length in certain situation, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-44466)  Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered that the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4622)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inner classes, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4623)  Alex Birnberg discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate register length, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability.
