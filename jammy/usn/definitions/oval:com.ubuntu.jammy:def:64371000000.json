This issue only affected  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-7998)  It was discovered that VIPS did not properly handle uninitialized memory locations when processing corrupted input image data. An attacker could  possibly use this issue to generate output images that expose sensitive  information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-6976)  It was discovered that VIPS did not properly manage memory due to an  uninitialized variable. If a user or automated system were tricked into  processing a specially crafted output file, an attacker could possibly  use this issue to expose sensitive information.  This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.  (CVE-2020-20739)  It was discovered that VIPS could be made to divide by zero in multiple  funcions. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a  specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue  to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-27847)  It was discovered that VIPS did not properly handle certain input files  that contained malformed UTF-8 characters. If a user or automated system  were tricked into processing a specially crafted SVG image file, an  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.  This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-40032)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6437-1` to fix the vulnerability.
