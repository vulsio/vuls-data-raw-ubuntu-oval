		"description": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for the TCINDEX classifier has been removed. (CVE-2023-1829)  It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-27672)  Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)  Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)  It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)  Xingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1513)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1872)  It was discovered that the Android Binder IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inputs in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-20938)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI TCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)  It was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32269)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1118)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6133-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-common - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-tools-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-intel-iotg-tools-5.15.0-1030 - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-modules-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1030 - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-headers-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-intel-iotg-headers-5.15.0-1030 - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-intel-iotg-tools-host - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-image-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35 linux-intel-iotg-tools-common - 5.15.0-1030.35 No subscription required  linux-headers-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1030.29 linux-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1030.29 linux-image-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1030.29 linux-tools-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1030.29 No subscription required",
