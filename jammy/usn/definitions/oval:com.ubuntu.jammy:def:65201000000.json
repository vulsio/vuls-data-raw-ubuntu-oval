		"description": "Ivan D Barrera, Christopher Bednarz, Mustafa Ismail, and Shiraz Saleem discovered that the InfiniBand RDMA driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for zero-length STAG or MR registration. A remote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25775)  Yu Hao and Weiteng Chen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI UART driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-31083)  Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-31085)  Lin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3772)  Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SMB request protocol IDs, leading to a out-of- bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38430)  Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate command payload size, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38432)  It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication in certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)  Laurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate a buffer size in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-3865)  Laurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability when handling handling chained requests. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3866)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle session setup requests, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-3867)  It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4132)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Cypress touchscreen driver in the Linux kernel during device removal, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4134)  Thelford Williams discovered that the Ceph file system messenger protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate frame segment length in certain situation, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-44466)  Manfred Rudigier discovered that the Intel(R) PCI-Express Gigabit (igb) Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate received frames that are larger than the set MTU size, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45871)  Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash). (CVE-2023-5090)  It was discovered that the SMB network file sharing protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5345)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6520-1` to fix the vulnerability.
