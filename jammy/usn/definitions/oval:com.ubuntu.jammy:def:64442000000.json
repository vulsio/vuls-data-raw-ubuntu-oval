		"description": "Ross Lagerwall discovered that the Xen netback backend driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain unusual packets from a paravirtualized network frontend, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-34319)  Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4244)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the networking stack implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate skb object size in certain conditions. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42752)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate array offsets, leading to a out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42753)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). Please note that kernel packet classifier support for RSVP has been removed to resolve this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-42755)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in IP set operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42756)  Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered that the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4622)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inner classes, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4623)  Alex Birnberg discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate register length, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4881)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packets in certain conditions, leading to a use after free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4921)  Kevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle removal of rules from chain bindings in certain circumstances, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5197)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6444-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-tools-6.2.0-1007-starfive - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 linux-headers-6.2.0-1007-starfive - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 linux-starfive-6.2-headers-6.2.0-1007 - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 linux-starfive-6.2-tools-6.2.0-1007 - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 linux-image-6.2.0-1007-starfive - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 linux-modules-extra-6.2.0-1007-starfive - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 linux-modules-6.2.0-1007-starfive - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 linux-buildinfo-6.2.0-1007-starfive - 6.2.0-1007.8~22.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-starfive - 6.2.0.1007.8~22.04.1 linux-starfive - 6.2.0.1007.8~22.04.1 linux-tools-starfive - 6.2.0.1007.8~22.04.1 linux-headers-starfive - 6.2.0.1007.8~22.04.1 No subscription required",
