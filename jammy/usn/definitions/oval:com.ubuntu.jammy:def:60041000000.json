		"description": "It was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2 VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI GRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3424)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36280)  Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41218)  Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4382)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-48423)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48424)  Jos√© Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0210)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the class-based queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23454)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23455)  It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle a loop termination condition, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-26606)  Wei Chen discovered that the DVB USB AZ6027 driver in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference when handling certain messages from user space. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-28328)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6004-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-common - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-headers-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-image-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-tools-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-intel-iotg-headers-5.15.0-1027 - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-intel-iotg-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1027 - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-intel-iotg-tools-host - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-intel-iotg-tools-common - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-modules-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32 linux-intel-iotg-tools-5.15.0-1027 - 5.15.0-1027.32 No subscription required  linux-tools-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-headers-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1027.26 linux-image-intel-iotg - 5.15.0.1027.26 No subscription required",
