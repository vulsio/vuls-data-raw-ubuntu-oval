		"description": "Yi Yang discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 21 incorrectly handled array accesses in the C1 compiler. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2024-20918)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 21 did not properly verify bytecode in certain situations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2024-20919)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 21 had an optimization flaw when generating range check loop predicates. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2024-20921)  It was discovered that OpenJDK 21 could produce debug logs that contained private keys used for digital signatures. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2024-20945)  Hubert Kario discovered that the TLS implementation in OpenJDK 21 had a timing side-channel and incorrectly handled RSA padding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover sensitive information. (CVE-2024-20952)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6662-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-21-doc - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 openjdk-21-jre-zero - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 openjdk-21-jdk-headless - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 openjdk-21-jdk - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 openjdk-21-jre-headless - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 openjdk-21-source - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 openjdk-21-jre - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 openjdk-21-demo - 21.0.2+13-1~22.04.1 No subscription required",
