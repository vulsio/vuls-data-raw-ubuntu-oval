		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during activity update Therule activity update delayed work periodically traverses the list ofconfigured rules and queries their activity from the device. As part ofthis task it accesses the entry pointed by 'ventry->entry', but this entrycan be changed concurrently by the rehash delayed work, leading to ause-after-free [1]. Fix by closing the race and perform the activity queryunder the 'vregion->lock' mutex.
