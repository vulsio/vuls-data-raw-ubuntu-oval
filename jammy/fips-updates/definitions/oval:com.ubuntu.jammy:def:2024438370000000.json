But this will lead to `libbpf_probe_bpf_prog_type`API broken which use verifier log to probe prog type and will lognothing if we reject invalid EXT prog before bpf_check().Another way is by adding null check in resolve_prog_type().The issue was introduced by commit 4a9c7bbe2ed4 (\"bpf: Resolve toprog->aux->dst_prog->type only for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT\") which wantedto correct type resolution for BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING programs. Beforethat, the type resolution of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT prog actually followsthe logic below:  prog->aux->dst_prog ? prog->aux->dst_prog->type : prog->type;It implies that when EXT program is not yet attached to `dst_prog`,the prog type should be EXT itself. This code worked fine in the past.So just keep using it.Fix this by returning `prog->type` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`is not present in resolve_prog_type().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43837` to fix the vulnerability.
