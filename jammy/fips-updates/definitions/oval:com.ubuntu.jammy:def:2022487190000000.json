		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net,neigh: Do not trigger immediate probes on NUD_FAILED fromneigh_managed_work syzkaller was able to trigger a deadlock for NTF_MANAGEDentries [0]: kworker/0:16/14617 is trying to acquire lock: ffffffff8d4dd370(&tbl->lock){++-.}-{2:2}, at: ___neigh_create+0x9e1/0x2990net/core/neighbour.c:652 [...] but task is already holding lock:ffffffff8d4dd370 (&tbl->lock){++-.}-{2:2}, at:neigh_managed_work+0x35/0x250 net/core/neighbour.c:1572 The neighbor entryturned to NUD_FAILED state, where __neigh_event_send() triggered animmediate probe as per commit cd28ca0a3dd1 (\"neigh: reduce arp latency\")via neigh_probe() given table lock was held. One option to fix thissituation is to defer the neigh_probe() back to the neigh_timer_handler()similarly as pre cd28ca0a3dd1. For the case of NTF_MANAGED, this deferralis acceptable given this only happens on actual failure state and regular /expected state is NUD_VALID with the entry already present. The fix adds aparameter to __neigh_event_send() in order to communicate whether immediateprobe is allowed or disallowed. Existing call-sites of neigh_event_send()default as-is to immediate probe. However, the neigh_managed_work()disables it via use of neigh_event_send_probe().
