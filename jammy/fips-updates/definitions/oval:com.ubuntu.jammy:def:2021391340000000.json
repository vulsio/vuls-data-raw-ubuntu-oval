		"description": "`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees andmanages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy for the npm command lineinterface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met,and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into theexpected folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependencyspecifiers defined in `package.json` manifests for dependencies with aspecific name, and nesting folders to resolve conflicting dependencies.When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name,Arborist's internal data structure saw them as separate items that couldcoexist within the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy. However, oncase-insensitive file systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not thecase. Combined with a symlink dependency such as `file:/some/path`, thisallowed an attacker to create a situation in which arbitrary contents couldbe written to any location on the filesystem. For example, a package`pwn-a` could define a dependency in their `package.json` file such as`\"foo\": \"file:/some/path\"`. Another package, `pwn-b` could define adependency such as `FOO: \"file:foo.tgz\"`. On case-insensitive file systems,if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, thecontents of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existingcontents of `/some/path` would be removed. Anyone using npm v7.20.6 orearlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially affected. This ispatched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 andabove.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-39134` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnpm - 8.5.1~ds-1\nNo subscription required",
