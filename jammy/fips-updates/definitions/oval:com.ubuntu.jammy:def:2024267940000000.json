		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix race between ordered extent completion and fiemap For fiemap werecently stopped locking the target extent range for the whole duration ofthe fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a scenario where thefiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of the same file. Thisuse case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but it may be triggeredby fuzz testing (syzbot, etc). However by not locking the target extentrange for the whole duration of the fiemap call we can race with an orderedextent. This happens like this: 1) The fiemap task finishes processing afile extent item that covers the file range [512K, 1M[, and that fileextent item is the last item in the leaf currently being processed; 2) Andordered extent for the file range [768K, 2M[, in COW mode, completes(btrfs_finish_one_ordered()) and the file extent item covering the range[512K, 1M[ is trimmed to cover the range [512K, 768K[ and then a new fileextent item for the range [768K, 2M[ is inserted in the inode's subvolumetree; 3) The fiemap task calls fiemap_next_leaf_item(), which then callsbtrfs_next_leaf() to find the next leaf / item. This finds that the thenext key following the one we previously processed (its type isBTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and its offset is 512K), is the key corresponding tothe new file extent item inserted by the ordered extent, which has a typeof BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and an offset of 768K; 4) Later the fiemap codeends up at emit_fiemap_extent() and triggers the warning: if (cache->offset+ cache->len > offset) { WARN_ON(1); return -EINVAL; } Since we get 1M >768K, because the previously emitted entry for the old extent covering thefile range [512K, 1M[ ends at an offset that is greater than the newextent's start offset (768K). This makes fiemap fail with -EINVAL besidestriggering the warning that produces a stack trace like the following:[1621.677651] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [1621.677656] WARNING:CPU: 1 PID: 204366 at fs/btrfs/extent_io.c:2492emit_fiemap_extent+0x84/0x90 [btrfs] [1621.677899] Modules linked in: btrfsblake2b_generic (...)
