		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Fix netif state handling mlx5e_suspend cleans resources only ifnetif_device_present() returns true. However, mlx5e_resume changes thestate of netif, via mlx5e_nic_enable, only if reg_state ==NETREG_REGISTERED. In the below case, the above leads to NULL-ptr Oops[1]and memory leaks: mlx5e_probe _mlx5e_resume mlx5e_attach_netdevmlx5e_nic_enable <-- netdev not reg, not calling netif_device_attach()register_netdev <-- failed for some reason.
