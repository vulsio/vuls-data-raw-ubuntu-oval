But registering sysfs precedes initializingrs->lock, so it is possible to change rs->interval to a non-zero valuevia the msg_ratelimit_interval_ms interface of sysfs while rs->lock isuninitialized, and then a call to ext4_msg triggers the problem byaccessing an uninitialized rs->lock. Therefore register sysfs after allinitializations are complete to avoid such problems.",
