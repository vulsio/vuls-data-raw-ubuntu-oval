		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipvlan:add ipvlan_route_v6_outbound() helper Inspired by syzbot reports using astack of multiple ipvlan devices. Reduce stack size needed inipvlan_process_v6_outbound() by moving the flowi6 struct used for the routelookup in an non inlined helper. ipvlan_route_v6_outbound() needs 120 byteson the stack, immediately reclaimed. Also make sureipvlan_process_v4_outbound() is not inlined. We might also have to lowerMAX_NEST_DEV, because only syzbot uses setups with more than four stackeddevices.
