		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:fix LAG and VF lock dependency in ice_reset_vf() 9f74a3dfcf83 (\"ice: Fix VFReset paths when interface in a failed over aggregate\"), the ice driver hasacquired the LAG mutex in ice_reset_vf(). The commit placed this lockacquisition just prior to the acquisition of the VF configuration lock. Ifice_reset_vf() acquires the configuration lock via the ICE_VF_RESET_LOCKflag, this could deadlock with ice_vc_cfg_qs_msg() because it alwaysacquires the locks in the order of the VF configuration lock and then theLAG mutex.
