		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix general protection fault in nilfs_btree_insert()If nilfs2 reads a corrupted disk image and tries to reads a b-tree nodeblock by calling __nilfs_btree_get_block() against an invalid virtualblock address, it returns -ENOENT because conversion of the virtual blockaddress to a disk block address fails.  However, this return value is thesame as the internal code that b-tree lookup routines return to indicatethat the block being searched does not exist, so functions that operate onthat b-tree may misbehave.When nilfs_btree_insert() receives this spurious 'not found' code fromnilfs_btree_do_lookup(), it misunderstands that the 'not found' check wassuccessful and continues the insert operation using incomplete lookup pathdata, causing the following crash: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000005: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000028-0x000000000000002f] ...
