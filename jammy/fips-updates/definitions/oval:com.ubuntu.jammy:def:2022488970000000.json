So in pmdp_invalidate() the file_map_countwill not only decrease once but also increase once. Then in set_pte_at(),the file_map_count increase again, and so trigger BUG_ON() unexpectedly.Add !pmd_present_invalid() check in pmd_user_accessible_page() to fix theproblem.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48897` to fix the vulnerability.
