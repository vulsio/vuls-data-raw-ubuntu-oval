		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during rehash The rehashdelayed work migrates filters from one region to another according to thenumber of available credits. The migrated from region is destroyed at theend of the work if the number of credits is non-negative as the assumptionis that this is indicative of migration being complete. This assumption isincorrect as a non-negative number of credits can also be the result of afailed migration. The destruction of a region that still has filtersreferencing it can result in a use-after-free [1]. Fix by not destroyingthe region if migration failed.
