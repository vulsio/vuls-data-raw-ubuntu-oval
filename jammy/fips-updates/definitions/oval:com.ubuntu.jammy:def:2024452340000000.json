		"description": "An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repositorythat descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP)an ROA or a Manifest containing a signedAttrs encoded in non-canonicalform. This bypasses Fort's BER decoder, reaching a point in the code thatpanics when faced with data not encoded in DER. Because Fort is an RPKIRelying Party, a panic can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability,which can lead to compromised routing.",
