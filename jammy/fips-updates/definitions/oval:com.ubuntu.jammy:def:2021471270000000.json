That is not something that shouldhappen for copy mode as it should use the regular data pathice_clean_tx_irq. This results in a following splat when xdpsock is run intxonly or l2fwd scenarios in copy mode: <snip> [ 106.050195] BUG: kernelNULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000030 [ 106.057269] #PF:supervisor read access in kernel mode [ 106.062493] #PF: error_code(0x0000)- not-present page [ 106.067709] PGD 0 P4D 0 [ 106.070293] Oops: 0000 [#1]PREEMPT SMP NOPTI [ 106.074721] CPU: 61 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/61 Not tainted5.12.0-rc2+ #45 [ 106.081436] Hardware name: Intel CorporationS2600WFT/S2600WFT, BIOS SE5C620.86B.02.01.0008.031920191559 03/19/2019 [106.092027] RIP: 0010:xp_raw_get_dma+0x36/0x50 [ 106.096551] Code: 74 14 48b8 ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00 48 21 f0 48 c1 ee 30 48 01 c6 48 8b 87 90 00 0000 48 89 f2 81 e6 ff 0f 00 00 48 c1 ea 0c <48> 8b 04 d0 48 83 e0 fe 48 01f0 c3 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 [ 106.115588] RSP:0018:ffffc9000d694e50 EFLAGS: 00010206 [ 106.120893] RAX: 0000000000000000RBX: ffff88984b8c8a00 RCX: ffff889852581800 [ 106.128137] RDX:0000000000000006 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffff88984cd8b800 [ 106.135383]RBP: ffff888123b50001 R08: ffff889896800000 R09: 0000000000000800 [106.142628] R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffffff826060c0 R12:00000000000000ff [ 106.149872] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000040R15: ffff888123b50018 [ 106.157117] FS: 0000000000000000(0000)GS:ffff8897e0f40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 [ 106.165332] CS: 0010 DS:0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 [ 106.171163] CR2: 0000000000000030CR3: 000000000560a004 CR4: 00000000007706e0 [ 106.178408] DR0:0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000 [ 106.185653]DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400 [106.192898] PKRU: 55555554 [ 106.195653] Call Trace: [ 106.198143] <IRQ> [106.200196] ice_clean_tx_irq_zc+0x183/0x2a0 [ice] [ 106.205087]ice_napi_poll+0x3e/0x590 [ice] [ 106.209356] __napi_poll+0x2a/0x160 [106.212911] net_rx_action+0xd6/0x200 [ 106.216634] __do_softirq+0xbf/0x29b[ 106.220274] irq_exit_rcu+0x88/0xc0 [ 106.223819]common_interrupt+0x7b/0xa0 [ 106.227719] </IRQ> [ 106.229857]asm_common_interrupt+0x1e/0x40 </snip> Fix this by introducing the bitmapof queues that are zero-copy enabled, where each bit, corresponding to aqueue id that xsk pool is being configured on, will be set/cleared withinice_xsk_pool_{en,dis}able and checked within ice_xsk_pool().
