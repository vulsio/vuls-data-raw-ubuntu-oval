		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: protect folio::private when attaching extent buffer folios[BUG]Since v6.8 there are rare kernel crashes reported by various people,the common factor is bad page status error messages like this:  BUG: Bad page state in process kswapd0  pfn:d6e840  page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:000000007512f4f2 index:0x2796c2c7c  pfn:0xd6e840  aops:btree_aops ino:1  flags: 0x17ffffe0000008(uptodate|node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0x3fffff)  page_type: 0xffffffff()  raw: 0017ffffe0000008 dead000000000100 dead000000000122 ffff88826d0be4c0  raw: 00000002796c2c7c 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000  page dumped because: non-NULL mapping[CAUSE]Commit 09e6cef19c9f (\"btrfs: refactor alloc_extent_buffer() toallocate-then-attach method\") changes the sequence when allocating a newextent buffer.Previously we always called grab_extent_buffer() undermapping->i_private_lock, to ensure the safety on modification onfolio::private (which is a pointer to extent buffer for regularsectorsize).This can lead to the following race:Thread A is trying to allocate an extent buffer at bytenr X, with 44K pages, meanwhile thread B is trying to release the page at X + 4K(the second page of the extent buffer at X).           Thread A                |                 Thread B-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------                                   | btree_release_folio()\t\t\t\t   | | This is for the page at X + 4K,\t\t\t\t   | | Not page X.\t\t\t\t   | |alloc_extent_buffer()              | |- release_extent_buffer()|- filemap_add_folio() for the     | |  |- atomic_dec_and_test(eb->refs)|  page at bytenr X (the first     | |  ||  page).                          | |  ||  Which returned -EEXIST.         | |  ||                                  | |  ||- filemap_lock_folio()            | |  ||  Returned the first page locked. | |  ||                                  | |  ||- grab_extent_buffer()            | |  ||  |- atomic_inc_not_zero()        | |  ||  |  Returned false               | |  ||  |- folio_detach_private()       | |  |- folio_detach_private() for X|     |- folio_test_private()      | |     |- folio_test_private()      |  Returned true             | |     |  Returned true      |- folio_put()               |       |- folio_put()Now there are two puts on the same folio at folio X, leading to refcountunderflow of the folio X, and eventually causing the BUG_ON() on thepage->mapping.The condition is not that easy to hit:- The release must be triggered for the middle page of an eb  If the release is on the same first page of an eb, page lock would kick  in and prevent the race.- folio_detach_private() has a very small race window  It's only between folio_test_private() and folio_clear_private().That's exactly when mapping->i_private_lock is used to prevent such race,and commit 09e6cef19c9f (\"btrfs: refactor alloc_extent_buffer() toallocate-then-attach method\") screwed that up.At that time, I thought the page lock would kick in asfilemap_release_folio() also requires the page to be locked, but forgotthe filemap_release_folio() only locks one page, not all pages of anextent buffer.[FIX]Move all the code requiring i_private_lock intoattach_eb_folio_to_filemap(), so that everything is done with properlock protection.Furthermore to prevent future problems, add an extralockdep_assert_locked() to ensure we're holding the proper lock.To reproducer that is able to hit the race (takes a few minutes withinstrumented code inserting delays to alloc_extent_buffer()):  #!/bin/sh  drop_caches () {\t  while(true); do\t\t  echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\t\t  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory\t  done  }  run_tar () {\t  while(true); do\t\t  for x in `seq 1 80` ; do\t\t\t  tar cf /dev/zero /mnt > /dev/null &\t\t  done\t\t  wait\t  done  }  mkfs.btrfs -f -d single -m single---truncated---",
