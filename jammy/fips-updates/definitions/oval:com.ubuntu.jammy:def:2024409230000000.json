		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vmxnet3: disable rx data ring on dma allocation failureWhen vmxnet3_rq_create() fails to allocate memory for rq->data_ring.base,the subsequent call to vmxnet3_rq_destroy_all_rxdataring does not resetrq->data_ring.desc_size for the data ring that failed, which presumablycauses the hypervisor to reference it on packet reception.To fix this bug, rq->data_ring.desc_size needs to be set to 0 to tellthe hypervisor to disable this feature.[   95.436876] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:207![   95.439074] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI[   95.440411] CPU: 7 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/7 Not tainted 6.9.3-dirty #1[   95.441558] Hardware name: VMware, Inc.
