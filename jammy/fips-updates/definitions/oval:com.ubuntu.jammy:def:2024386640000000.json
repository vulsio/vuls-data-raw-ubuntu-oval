		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm:zynqmp_dpsub: Always register bridge We must always register the DRMbridge, since zynqmp_dp_hpd_work_func calls drm_bridge_hpd_notify, which inturn expects hpd_mutex to be initialized. We do this beforezynqmp_dpsub_drm_init since that calls drm_bridge_attach.
