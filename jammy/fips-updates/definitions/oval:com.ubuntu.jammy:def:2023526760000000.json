		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Guard stack limits against 32bit overflow This patch promotes thearithmetic around checking stack bounds to be done in the 64-bit domain,instead of the current 32bit. The arithmetic implies adding together a64-bit register with a int offset. The register was checked to be below1<<29 when it was variable, but not when it was fixed. The offset eithercomes from an instruction (in which case it is 16 bit), from anotherregister (in which case the caller checked it to be below 1<<29 [1]), orfrom the size of an argument to a kfunc (in which case it can be a u32[2]). Between the register being inconsistently checked to be below 1<<29,and the offset being up to an u32, it appears that we were open tooverflowing the `int`s which were currently used for arithmetic.
