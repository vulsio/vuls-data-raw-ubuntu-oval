		"description": "NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDPrepositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validationrun. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish itsdata in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists ofanother CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create achain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and willtherefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, thevalidation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to servethe old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly afterstarting, never serve any data at all.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-43172` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrpki-client - 7.6-1\nNo subscription required",
