		"description": "Pydantic is a data validation and settings management using Python typehinting. In affected versions passing either `'infinity'`, `'inf'` or`float('inf')` (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date` fields causesvalidation to run forever with 100% CPU usage (on one CPU). Pydantic hasbeen patched with fixes available in the following versions: v1.8.2,v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available onpypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be available onconda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic) soon. See thechangelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for details. If youabsolutely can't upgrade, you can work around this risk using avalidator(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/) to catchthese values. This is not an ideal solution (in particular you'll need aslightly different function for datetimes), instead of a hack like this youshould upgrade pydantic. If you are not using v1.8.x, v1.7.x or v1.6.x andare unable to upgrade to a fixed version of pydantic, please create anissue at https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues requesting aback-port, and we will endeavour to release a patch for earlier versions ofpydantic.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29510` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-pydantic - 1.8.2-1\nNo subscription required",
