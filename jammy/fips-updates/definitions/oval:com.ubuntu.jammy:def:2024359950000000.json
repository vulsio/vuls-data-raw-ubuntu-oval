		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ACPI:CPPC: Use access_width over bit_width for system memory accesses To alignwith ACPI 6.3+, since bit_width can be any 8-bit value, it cannot bedepended on to be always on a clean 8b boundary. This was uncovered on theCobalt 100 platform.
