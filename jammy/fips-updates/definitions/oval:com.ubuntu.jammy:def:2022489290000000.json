		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix crash due to out of bounds access into reg2btf_ids.When commit e6ac2450d6de (\"bpf: Support bpf program calling kernelfunction\") addedkfunc support, it defined reg2btf_ids as a cheap way to translate theverifierreg type to the appropriate btf_vmlinux BTF ID, howevercommit c25b2ae13603 (\"bpf: Replace PTR_TO_XXX_OR_NULL with PTR_TO_XXX |PTR_MAYBE_NULL\")moved the __BPF_REG_TYPE_MAX from the last member of bpf_reg_type enum toafterthe base register types, and defined other variants using type flagcomposition. However, now, the direct usage of reg->type to index intoreg2btf_ids may no longer fall into __BPF_REG_TYPE_MAX range, and hencelead toout of bounds access and kernel crash on dereference of bad pointer.",
