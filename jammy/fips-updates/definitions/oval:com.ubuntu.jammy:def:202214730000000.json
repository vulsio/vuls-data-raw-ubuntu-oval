		"description": "The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bugthat breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash tableentries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If along lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memoryusage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by theoperating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the emptyhash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such longlived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to acceptclient certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue. Fixed inOpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1473` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.1\nopenssl - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
