		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath12k: fix firmware crash due to invalid peer nssCurrently, if the access point receives an associationrequest containing an Extended HE Capabilities InformationElement with an invalid MCS-NSS, it triggers a firmwarecrash.This issue arises when EHT-PHY capabilities shows supportfor a bandwidth and MCS-NSS set for that particularbandwidth is filled by zeros and due to this, driver obtainspeer_nss as 0 and sending this value to firmware causescrash.Address this issue by implementing a validation step forthe peer_nss value before passing it to the firmware. Ifthe value is greater than zero, proceed with forwardingit to the firmware. However, if the value is invalid,reject the association request to prevent potentialfirmware crashes.Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
