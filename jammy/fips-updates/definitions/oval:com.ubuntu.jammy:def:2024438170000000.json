		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: missing check virtioTwo missing check in virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() allowed syzbotto crash kernels again1. After the skb_segment function the buffer may become non-linear(nr_frags != 0), but since the SKBTX_SHARED_FRAG flag is not set anywherethe __skb_linearize function will not be executed, then the buffer willremain non-linear. Then the condition (offset >= skb_headlen(skb))becomes true, which causes WARN_ON_ONCE in skb_checksum_help.2. The struct sk_buff and struct virtio_net_hdr members must bemathematically related.(gso_size) must be greater than (needed) otherwise WARN_ON_ONCE.(remainder) must be greater than (needed) otherwise WARN_ON_ONCE.(remainder) may be 0 if division is without remainder.offset+2 (4191) > skb_headlen() (1116)WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5084 at net/core/dev.c:3303skb_checksum_help+0x5e2/0x740 net/core/dev.c:3303Modules linked in:CPU: 1 PID: 5084 Comm: syz-executor336 Not tainted6.7.0-rc3-syzkaller-00014-gdf60cee26a2e #0Hardware name: Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google11/10/2023RIP: 0010:skb_checksum_help+0x5e2/0x740 net/core/dev.c:3303Code: 89 e8 83 e0 07 83 c0 03 38 d0 7c 08 84 d2 0f 85 52 01 00 00 44 89 e22b 53 74 4c 89 ee 48 c7 c7 40 57 e9 8b e8 af 8f dd f8 90 <0f> 0b 90 90 e987 fe ff ff e8 40 0f 6e f9 e9 4b fa ff ff 48 89 efRSP: 0018:ffffc90003a9f338 EFLAGS: 00010286RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff888025125780 RCX: ffffffff814db209RDX: ffff888015393b80 RSI: ffffffff814db216 RDI: 0000000000000001RBP: ffff8880251257f4 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: 000000000000045cR13: 000000000000105f R14: ffff8880251257f0 R15: 000000000000105dFS:  0000555555c24380(0000) GS:ffff8880b9900000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 000000002000f000 CR3: 0000000023151000 CR4: 00000000003506f0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400Call Trace: <TASK> ip_do_fragment+0xa1b/0x18b0 net/ipv4/ip_output.c:777 ip_fragment.constprop.0+0x161/0x230 net/ipv4/ip_output.c:584 ip_finish_output_gso net/ipv4/ip_output.c:286 [inline] __ip_finish_output net/ipv4/ip_output.c:308 [inline] __ip_finish_output+0x49c/0x650 net/ipv4/ip_output.c:295 ip_finish_output+0x31/0x310 net/ipv4/ip_output.c:323 NF_HOOK_COND include/linux/netfilter.h:303 [inline] ip_output+0x13b/0x2a0 net/ipv4/ip_output.c:433 dst_output include/net/dst.h:451 [inline] ip_local_out+0xaf/0x1a0 net/ipv4/ip_output.c:129 iptunnel_xmit+0x5b4/0x9b0 net/ipv4/ip_tunnel_core.c:82 ipip6_tunnel_xmit net/ipv6/sit.c:1034 [inline] sit_tunnel_xmit+0xed2/0x28f0 net/ipv6/sit.c:1076 __netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:4940 [inline] netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:4954 [inline] xmit_one net/core/dev.c:3545 [inline] dev_hard_start_xmit+0x13d/0x6d0 net/core/dev.c:3561 __dev_queue_xmit+0x7c1/0x3d60 net/core/dev.c:4346 dev_queue_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:3134 [inline] packet_xmit+0x257/0x380 net/packet/af_packet.c:276 packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3087 [inline] packet_sendmsg+0x24ca/0x5240 net/packet/af_packet.c:3119 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0xd5/0x180 net/socket.c:745 __sys_sendto+0x255/0x340 net/socket.c:2190 __do_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2202 [inline] __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2198 [inline] __x64_sys_sendto+0xe0/0x1b0 net/socket.c:2198 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:51 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x40/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:82 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6bFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller",
