		"description": "A vulnerability in the PyTorch's torch.distributed.rpc framework,specifically in versions prior to 2.2.2, allows for remote code execution(RCE). The framework, which is used in distributed training scenarios, doesnot properly verify the functions being called during RPC (Remote ProcedureCall) operations. This oversight permits attackers to execute arbitrarycommands by leveraging built-in Python functions such as eval duringmulti-cpu RPC communication. The vulnerability arises from the lack ofrestriction on function calls when a worker node serializes and sends aPythonUDF (User Defined Function) to the master node, which thendeserializes and executes the function without validation. This flaw can beexploited to compromise master nodes initiating distributed training,potentially leading to the theft of sensitive AI-related data.",
