For the SR-IOV case, default DMAwindow \"ibm,dma-window\" is removed from the FDT and DDW added, for thedevice. Now, kexec hands over control to the kdump kernel. When the kdumpkernel initializes, PCI busses are scanned and IOMMU group/tables created,in pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeriesLP(). For the SR-IOV case, there is no\"ibm,dma-window\". The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba, fixes the path wherememory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW. When TCEs are directmapped, there is no need to initialize IOMMU tables.iommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers \"ibm,dma-window\" property wheninitiallizing IOMMU table. In the scenario where TCEs are dynamicallyallocated for SR-IOV, newly created IOMMU table is not initialized. Later,when the device driver tries to enter TCEs for the SR-IOV device, NULLpointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc(). The fix is toinitialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in the FDT. There are 2points to remember: 1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel wouldencounter both default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is usedto initialize the IOMMU table. 2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped.kdump kernel would initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as\"dynamic\". This works fine since, at the time of table initialization,iommu_table_clear() makes some space in the DDW, for some predefined numberof TCEs which are needed for kdump to succeed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26745` to fix the vulnerability.
