		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fbcon:always restore the old font data in fbcon_do_set_font() Commit a5a923038d70(fbdev: fbcon: Properly revert changes when vc_resize() failed) startedrestoring old font data upon failure (of vc_resize()). But it performs soonly for user fonts. It means that the \"system\"/internal fonts are notrestored at all. So in result, the very first call to fbcon_do_set_font()performs no restore at all upon failing vc_resize(). This can be reproducedby Syzkaller to crash the system on the next invocation of font_get(). It'srather hard to hit the allocation failure in vc_resize() on the firstfont_set(), but not impossible. Esp. if fault injection is used to aid theexecution/failure. It was demonstrated by Sirius: BUG: unable to handlepage fault for address: fffffffffffffff8 #PF: supervisor read access inkernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page PGD cb7b067 P4Dcb7b067 PUD cb7d067 PMD 0 Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN CPU: 1 PID:8007 Comm: poc Not tainted 6.7.0-g9d1694dc91ce #20 Hardware name: QEMUStandard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014 RIP:0010:fbcon_get_font+0x229/0x800 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:2286 CallTrace: <TASK> con_font_get drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:4558 [inline]con_font_op+0x1fc/0xf20 drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:4673 vt_k_ioctldrivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c:474 [inline] vt_ioctl+0x632/0x2ec0drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c:752 tty_ioctl+0x6f8/0x1570drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2803 vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline] ...
