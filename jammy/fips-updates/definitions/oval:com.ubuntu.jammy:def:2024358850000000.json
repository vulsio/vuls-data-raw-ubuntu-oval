However, the driver's stop() method will only executeif networking interface configuration logic within the Linux distributionhas been setup to do so.

The networking interface managed by the mlxbf_gige drivermust be properly stopped during system shutdown so that IFF_UP is cleared,the hardware interface is put into a clean state, and NAPI is fullydeinitialized.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35885` to fix the vulnerability.
