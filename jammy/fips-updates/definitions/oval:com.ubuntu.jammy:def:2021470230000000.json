		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:marvell: prestera: fix port event handling on init For some reason theremight be a crash during ports creation if port events are handling at thesame time because fw may send initial port event with down state. The crashpoints to cancel_delayed_work() which is called when port went is down.Currently I did not find out the real cause of the issue, so fixed it bycancel port stats work only if previous port's state was up & runnig.
