		"description": "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supportingPython 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1, the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server,located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP requestconstructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformantparsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers,potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling. Users who may be affecteduse Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also pass requeststhrough a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is notaffected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser, so it is notaffected. The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1. Twoworkarounds are available: Ensure any vulnerabilities in upstream proxieshave been addressed, such as by upgrading them; or filter malformedrequests by other means, such as configuration of an upstream proxy.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24801` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-twisted - 22.1.0-2ubuntu2.3\nNo subscription required",
