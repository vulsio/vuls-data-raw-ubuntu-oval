		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mac80211: fix initialization of rx->link and rx->link_staThere are some codepaths that do not initialize rx->link_sta properly. Thiscauses a crash in places which assume that rx->link_sta is valid if rx->stais valid.One known instance is triggered by __ieee80211_rx_h_amsdu being called fromfast-rx. It results in a crash like this one: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000a8 #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI CPU: 1 PID: 506 Comm: mt76-usb-rx phy Tainted: G            E6.1.0-debian64x+1.7 #3 Hardware name: ZOTAC ZBOX-ID92/ZBOX-IQ01/ZBOX-ID92/ZBOX-IQ01, BIOSB220P007 05/21/2014 RIP: 0010:ieee80211_deliver_skb+0x62/0x1f0 [mac80211] Code: 00 48 89 04 24 e8 9e a7 c3 df 89 c0 48 03 1c c5 a0 ea 39 a1 4c 01 6b08 48 ff 03 48       83 7d 28 00 74 11 48 8b 45 30 48 63 55 44 <48> 83 84 d0 a8 00 00 0001 41 8b 86 c0       11 00 00 8d 50 fd 83 fa 01 RSP: 0018:ffff999040803b10 EFLAGS: 00010286 RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffb9903f496480 RCX: 0000000000000000 RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: 0000000000000000 RBP: ffff999040803ce0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000 R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff8d21828ac900 R13: 000000000000004a R14: ffff8d2198ed89c0 R15: ffff8d2198ed8000 FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8d24afe80000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000 CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 00000000000000a8 CR3: 0000000429810002 CR4: 00000000001706e0 Call Trace:  <TASK>  __ieee80211_rx_h_amsdu+0x1b5/0x240 [mac80211]  ? ieee80211_prepare_and_rx_handle+0xcdd/0x1320 [mac80211]  ? __local_bh_enable_ip+0x3b/0xa0  ieee80211_prepare_and_rx_handle+0xcdd/0x1320 [mac80211]  ? prepare_transfer+0x109/0x1a0 [xhci_hcd]  ieee80211_rx_list+0xa80/0xda0 [mac80211]  mt76_rx_complete+0x207/0x2e0 [mt76]  mt76_rx_poll_complete+0x357/0x5a0 [mt76]  mt76u_rx_worker+0x4f5/0x600 [mt76_usb]  ? mt76_get_min_avg_rssi+0x140/0x140 [mt76]  __mt76_worker_fn+0x50/0x80 [mt76]  kthread+0xed/0x120  ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20  ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30Since the initialization of rx->link and rx->link_sta is rather convolutedand duplicated in many places, clean it up by using a helper function toset it.[remove unnecessary rx->sta->sta.mlo check]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48876` to fix the vulnerability.
