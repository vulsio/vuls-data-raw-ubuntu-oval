		"description": "eProsima Fast DDS (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the DataDistribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Even with theapplication of SROS2, due to the issue where the data (`p[UD]`) and `guid`values used to disconnect between nodes are not encrypted, a vulnerabilityhas been discovered where a malicious attacker can forcibly disconnect aSubscriber and can deny a Subscriber attempting to connect. Afterwards, ifthe attacker sends the packet for disconnecting, which is data (`p[UD]`),to the Global Data Space (`239.255.0.1:7400`) using the said Publisher ID,all the Subscribers (Listeners) connected to the Publisher (Talker) willnot receive any data and their connection will be disconnected. Moreover,if this disconnection packet is sent continuously, the Subscribers(Listeners) trying to connect will not be able to do so. Since the initialcommit of the `SecurityManager.cpp` code (`init`, `on_process_handshake`)on Nov 8, 2016, the Disconnect Vulnerability in RTPS Packets Used by SROS2has been present prior to versions 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and2.6.7.",
