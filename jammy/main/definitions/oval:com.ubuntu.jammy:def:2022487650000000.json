The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot pathwill not disarm the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown()clearsAPIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bit is 0, this can triggertimer-modeswitch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic, which can result inpreemptiontimer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on thiswhennot exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated bypreemptiontimer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemptiontimerunder KVM_SET_LAPIC.",
