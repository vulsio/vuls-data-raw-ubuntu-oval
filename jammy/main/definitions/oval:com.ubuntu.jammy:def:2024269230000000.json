		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()Garbage collector does not take into account the risk of embryo gettingenqueued during the garbage collection. If such embryo has a peer thatcarries SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() may see adifferent set of children.

Thismakes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. Afterflipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And ifthere is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. Atthis point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is alreadytaken. Inflight graph remains unaffected.",
