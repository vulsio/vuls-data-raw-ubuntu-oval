		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dm:call the resume method on internal suspend There is this reported crashwhen experimenting with the lvm2 testsuite. The list corruption is causedby the fact that the postsuspend and resume methods were not pairedcorrectly; there were two consecutive calls to the origin_postsuspendfunction. The second call attempts to remove the \"hash_list\" entry from alist, while it was already removed by the first call. Fix__dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume methods ofthe table's targets. If a preresume method of some target fails, we are ina tricky situation. We can't return an error because dm_internal_resumeisn't supposed to return errors. We can't return success, because then the\"resume\" and \"postsuspend\" methods would not be paired correctly. So, weset the DMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuseuserspace tools, but it won't cause a kernel crash. ------------[ cut here]------------ kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56! invalid opcode: 0000 [#1]PREEMPT SMP CPU: 1 PID: 8343 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6 #4Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-204/01/2014 RIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 <snip> RSP:0018:ffff8881b831bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010282 RAX: 000000000000004e RBX:ffff888143b6eb80 RCX: 0000000000000000 RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI:ffffffff819053d0 RDI: 00000000ffffffff RBP: ffff8881b83a3400 R08:00000000fffeffff R09: 0000000000000058 R10: 0000000000000000 R11:ffffffff81a24080 R12: 0000000000000001 R13: ffff88814538e000 R14:ffff888143bc6dc0 R15: ffffffffa02e4bb0 FS: 00000000f7c0f780(0000)GS:ffff8893f0a40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS: 0010 DS: 002b ES: 002bCR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000057fb5000 CR3: 0000000143474000 CR4:00000000000006b0 Call Trace: <TASK> ? die+0x2d/0x80 ? do_trap+0xeb/0xf0 ?__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? do_error_trap+0x60/0x80 ?__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? exc_invalid_op+0x49/0x60 ?__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20 ?table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod] ?__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 origin_postsuspend+0x1a/0x50[dm_snapshot] dm_table_postsuspend_targets+0x34/0x50 [dm_mod]dm_suspend+0xd8/0xf0 [dm_mod] dev_suspend+0x1f2/0x2f0 [dm_mod] ?table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod] ctl_ioctl+0x300/0x5f0 [dm_mod]dm_compat_ctl_ioctl+0x7/0x10 [dm_mod] __x64_compat_sys_ioctl+0x104/0x170do_syscall_64+0x184/0x1b0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4e RIP:0033:0xf7e6aead <snip> ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26880` to fix the vulnerability.
