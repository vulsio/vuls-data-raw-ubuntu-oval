		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bus:mhi: host: Drop chan lock before queuing buffers Ensure read and writelocks for the channel are not taken in succession by dropping the read lockfrom parse_xfer_event() such that a callback given to client canpotentially queue buffers and acquire the write lock in that process. Anyqueueing of buffers should be done without channel read lock acquired as itcan result in multiple locks and a soft lockup.
