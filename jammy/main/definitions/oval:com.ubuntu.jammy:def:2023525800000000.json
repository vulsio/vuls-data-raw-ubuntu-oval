		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/core: Fix ETH_P_1588 flow dissector When a PTP ethernet raw frame witha size of more than 256 bytes followed by a 0xff pattern is sent to__skb_flow_dissect, nhoff value calculation is wrong. For example:hdr->message_length takes the wrong value (0xffff) and it does notreplicate real header length. In this case, 'nhoff' value was overriddenand the PTP header was badly dissected. This leads to a kernel crash.net/core: flow_dissector net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x0000000enet/core flow dissector hdr->message_length = 0x0000ffff net/core flowdissector nhoff = 0x0001000d (u16 overflow) ... skb linear: 00000000: 00 a0c9 00 00 00 00 a0 c9 00 00 00 88 skb frag: 00000000: f7 ff ff ff ff ff ffff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff Using the size of the ptp_header struct willallow the corrected calculation of the nhoff value. net/core flow dissectornhoff = 0x0000000e net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x00000030 (sizeofptp_header) ... skb linear: 00000000: 00 a0 c9 00 00 00 00 a0 c9 00 00 0088 f7 ff ff skb linear: 00000010: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ffff ff skb linear: 00000020: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ffskb frag: 00000000: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff Kerneltrace: [ 74.984279] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 74.989471]kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:2440!
