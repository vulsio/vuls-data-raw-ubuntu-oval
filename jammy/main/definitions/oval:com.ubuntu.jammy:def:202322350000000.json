		"Title": "CVE-2023-2235 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel Performance Events system can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The perf_group_detach function did not check the event's siblings' attach_state before calling add_event_to_groups(), but remove_on_exec made it possible to call list_del_event() on before detaching from their group, making it possible to use a dangling pointer causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit fd0815f632c24878e325821943edccc7fde947a2. It was discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2235` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1021-oem - 6.0.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1035-raspi - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1021-oem - 6.0.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required",
