		"Title": "CVE-2023-25577 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited numberof parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, buteach requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. Ifa request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`,`request.form`, `request.files`, or`request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly highresource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service bysending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. Theamount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handlinglegitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out ofmemory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and filehandles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this canexhaust or kill all available workers. Version 2.2.3 contains a patch forthis issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25577` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-werkzeug - 2.0.2+dfsg1-1ubuntu0.22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
