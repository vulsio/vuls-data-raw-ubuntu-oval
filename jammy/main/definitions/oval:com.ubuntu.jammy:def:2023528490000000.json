This is ultimately due to the region(s), that this memdevis a member, being torn down and expecting to be able to de-reference@cxlds, like here: static int cxl_region_decode_reset(struct cxl_region*cxlr, int count) ... if (cxlds->rcd) goto endpoint_reset; ... Fix it bykeeping the driver context valid until memdev-device unregistration, andsubsequently the entire stack of related dependencies, unwinds.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52849` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1058-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1058.66.1\nNo subscription required",
