		"Title": "CVE-2023-25775 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "Improper access control in the Intel(R) Ethernet Controller RDMA driver for linux before version 1.9.30 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via network access. Ivan D Barrera, Christopher Bednarz, Mustafa Ismail, and Shiraz Saleem discovered that the InfiniBand RDMA driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for zero-length STAG or MR registration. A remote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25775` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-aws - 5.15.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure - 5.15.0-1053.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure - 6.2.0-1018.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1053.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1018.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-gcp - 5.15.0-1048.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-ibm - 5.15.0-1043.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1045.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-kvm - 5.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia - 5.15.0-1041.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1041.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-nvidia - 6.2.0-1012.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-nvidia-64k - 6.2.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1023-oem - 6.1.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-oem - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-oracle - 5.15.0-1048.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1043-raspi - 5.15.0-1043.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-5.15.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-generic-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-aws - 5.15.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure - 5.15.0-1053.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure - 6.2.0-1018.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1053.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1018.18~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-gcp - 5.15.0-1048.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-37.38~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-ibm - 5.15.0-1043.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1045.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-kvm - 5.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency - 5.15.0-89.99\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-89-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-89.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1017.17~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia - 5.15.0-1041.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1041.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-nvidia - 6.2.0-1012.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-nvidia-64k - 6.2.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1023-oem - 6.1.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-oem - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-oracle - 5.15.0-1048.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1009-starfive - 6.2.0-1009.10~22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
