		"description": "Flysystem is an open source file storage library for PHP. The whitespacenormalisation using in 1.x and 2.x removes any unicode whitespace. Undercertain specific conditions this could potentially allow a malicious userto execute code remotely. The conditions are: A user is allowed to supplythe path or filename of an uploaded file, the supplied path or filename isnot checked against unicode chars, the supplied pathname checked against anextension deny-list, not an allow-list, the supplied path or filenamecontains a unicode whitespace char in the extension, the uploaded file isstored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed. Given theseconditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on thesystem under attack. The unicode whitespace removal has been replaced witha rejection (exception). For 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users,upgrade to 2.1.1.",
