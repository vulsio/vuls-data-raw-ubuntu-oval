		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/filemap: make MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER acceptable to xarrayPatch series \"mm/filemap: Limit page cache size to that supported byxarray\", v2.Currently, xarray can't support arbitrary page cache size.  More detailscan be found from the WARN_ON() statement in xas_split_alloc().  In ourtest whose code is attached below, we hit the WARN_ON() on ARM64 systemwhere the base page size is 64KB and huge page size is 512MB.  The issuewas reported long time ago and some discussions on it can be found here[1].[1] https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg75404.htmlIn order to fix the issue, we need to adjust MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER to onesupported by xarray and avoid PMD-sized page cache if needed.  The codechanges are suggested by David Hildenbrand.PATCH[1] adjusts MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER to that supported by xarrayPATCH[2-3] avoids PMD-sized page cache in the synchronous readahead pathPATCH[4] avoids PMD-sized page cache for shmem files if neededTest program============# cat test.c#define _GNU_SOURCE#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>#include <unistd.h>#include <string.h>#include <fcntl.h>#include <errno.h>#include <sys/syscall.h>#include <sys/mman.h>#define TEST_XFS_FILENAME\t\"/tmp/data\"#define TEST_SHMEM_FILENAME\t\"/dev/shm/data\"#define TEST_MEM_SIZE\t\t0x20000000int main(int argc, char **argv){\tconst char *filename;\tint fd = 0;\tvoid *buf = (void *)-1, *p;\tint pgsize = getpagesize();\tint ret;\tif (pgsize != 0x10000) {\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"64KB base page size is required\\n\");\t\treturn -EPERM;\t}\tsystem(\"echo force > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled\");\tsystem(\"rm -fr /tmp/data\");\tsystem(\"rm -fr /dev/shm/data\");\tsystem(\"echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\");\t/* Open xfs or shmem file */\tfilename = TEST_XFS_FILENAME;\tif (argc > 1 && !strcmp(argv[1], \"shmem\"))\t\tfilename = TEST_SHMEM_FILENAME;\tfd = open(filename, O_CREAT | O_RDWR | O_TRUNC);\tif (fd < 0) {\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"Unable to open <%s>\\n\", filename);\t\treturn -EIO;\t}\t/* Extend file size */\tret = ftruncate(fd, TEST_MEM_SIZE);\tif (ret) {\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"Error %d to ftruncate()\\n\", ret);\t\tgoto cleanup;\t}\t/* Create VMA */\tbuf = mmap(NULL, TEST_MEM_SIZE,\t\t   PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);\tif (buf == (void *)-1) {\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"Unable to mmap <%s>\\n\", filename);\t\tgoto cleanup;\t}\tfprintf(stdout, \"mapped buffer at 0x%p\\n\", buf);\tret = madvise(buf, TEST_MEM_SIZE, MADV_HUGEPAGE);        if (ret) {\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"Unable to madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE)\\n\");\t\tgoto cleanup;\t}\t/* Populate VMA */\tret = madvise(buf, TEST_MEM_SIZE, MADV_POPULATE_WRITE);\tif (ret) {\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"Error %d to madvise(MADV_POPULATE_WRITE)\\n\", ret);\t\tgoto cleanup;\t}\t/* Punch the file to enforce xarray split */\tret = fallocate(fd, FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE | FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE,        \t\tTEST_MEM_SIZE - pgsize, pgsize);\tif (ret)\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"Error %d to fallocate()\\n\", ret);cleanup:\tif (buf != (void *)-1)\t\tmunmap(buf, TEST_MEM_SIZE);\tif (fd > 0)\t\tclose(fd);\treturn 0;}# gcc test.c -o test# cat /proc/1/smaps | grep KernelPageSize | head -n 1KernelPageSize:       64 kB# ./test shmem   :------------[ cut here ]------------WARNING: CPU: 17 PID: 5253 at lib/xarray.c:1025 xas_split_alloc+0xf8/0x128Modules linked in: nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6 nft_fib  \\nft_reject_inet nf_reject_ipv4 nf_reject_ipv6 nft_reject nft_ct    \\nft_chain_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4    \\ip_set nf_tables rfkill nfnetlink vfat fat virtio_balloon          \\drm fuse xfs libcrc32c crct10dif_ce ghash_ce sha2_ce sha256_arm64  \\virtio_net sha1_ce net_failover failover virtio_console virtio_blk \\dimlib virtio_mmioCPU: 17 PID: 5253 Comm: test Kdump: loaded Tainted: G W 6.10.0-rc5-gavin+#12Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS edk2-20240524-1.el905/24/2024pstate: 83400005 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO +TC---truncated---",
