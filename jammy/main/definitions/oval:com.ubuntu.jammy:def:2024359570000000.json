		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Fix WARN_ON in iommu probe pathCommit 1a75cc710b95 (\"iommu/vt-d: Use rbtree to track iommu probeddevices\") adds all devices probed by the iommu driver in a rbtreeindexed by the source ID of each device. It assumes that each devicehas a unique source ID. This assumption is incorrect and the VT-dspec doesn't state this requirement either.The reason for using a rbtree to track devices is to look up the devicewith PCI bus and devfunc in the paths of handling ATS invalidation timeout error and the PRI I/O page faults. Both are PCI ATS feature related.Only track the devices that have PCI ATS capabilities in the rbtree toavoid unnecessary WARN_ON in the iommu probe path. Otherwise, on someplatforms below kernel splat will be displayed and the iommu probe resultsin failure.
