		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Add platform entry for ETDM1_OUT_BE dai linkCommit e70b8dd26711 (\"ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Remove afe-dai componentand rework codec link\") removed the codec entry for the ETDM1_OUT_BEdai link entirely instead of replacing it with COMP_EMPTY(). This workedby accident as the remaining COMP_EMPTY() platform entry became the codecentry, and the platform entry became completely empty, effectively thesame as COMP_DUMMY() since snd_soc_fill_dummy_dai() doesn't do anythingfor platform entries.This causes a KASAN out-of-bounds warning in mtk_soundcard_common_probe()in sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-soundcard-driver.c:\tfor_each_card_prelinks(card, i, dai_link) {\t\tif (adsp_node && !strncmp(dai_link->name, \"AFE_SOF\", strlen(\"AFE_SOF\")))\t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = adsp_node;\t\telse if (!dai_link->platforms->name && !dai_link->platforms->of_node)\t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = platform_node;\t}where the code expects the platforms array to have space for at least oneentry.Add an COMP_EMPTY() entry so that dai_link->platforms has space.",
