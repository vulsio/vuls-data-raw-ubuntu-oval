		"title": "CVE-2023-4273 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the exFAT driver of the Linux kernel. The vulnerabilityexists in the implementation of the file name reconstruction function,which is responsible for reading file name entries from a directory indexand merging file name parts belonging to one file into a single long filename. Since the file name characters are copied into a stack variable, alocal privileged attacker could use this flaw to overflow the kernel stack.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4273` to fix the vulnerability.
