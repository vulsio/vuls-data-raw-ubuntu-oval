		"title": "CVE-2024-26747 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:roles: fix NULL pointer issue when put module's reference In currentdesign, usb role class driver will get usb_role_switch parent's modulereference after the user get usb_role_switch device and put the referenceafter the user put the usb_role_switch device. However, the parent deviceof usb_role_switch may be removed before the user put the usb_role_switch.If so, then, NULL pointer issue will be met when the user put the parentmodule's reference. This will save the module pointer in structure ofusb_role_switch. Then, we don't need to find module by iterating longrelations.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26747` to fix the vulnerability.
