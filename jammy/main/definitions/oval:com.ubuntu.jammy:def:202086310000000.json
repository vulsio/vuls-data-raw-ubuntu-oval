    "Description": "cloud-init through 19.4 relies on Mersenne Twister for a random password, which makes it easier for attackers to predict passwords, because rand_str in cloudinit/util.py calls the random.choice function.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-8631` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncloud-init - 21.4-25-g039c40f9-0ubuntu1~22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
