		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: f2fs:fix to avoid dirent corruption As Al reported in link[1]: f2fs_rename() ...if (old_dir != new_dir && !whiteout) f2fs_set_link(old_inode,old_dir_entry, old_dir_page, new_dir); else f2fs_put_page(old_dir_page, 0);You want correct inumber in the \"..\" link. And cross-directory rename doesmove the source to new parent, even if you'd been asked to leave a whiteoutin the old place. [1]https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231017055040.GN800259@ZenIV/ With belowtestcase, it may cause dirent corruption, due to it missed to callf2fs_set_link() to update \"..\" link to new directory. - mkdir -p dir/foo -renameat2 -w dir/foo bar [ASSERT] (__chk_dots_dentries:1421) --> Bad inodenumber[0x4] for '..', parent parent ino is [0x3] [FSCK] other corruptedbugs [Fail]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52444` to fix the vulnerability.
