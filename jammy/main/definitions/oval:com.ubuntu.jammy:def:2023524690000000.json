		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table When psallocated by kzalloc equals to NULL, kv_parse_power_table freesadev->pm.dpm.ps that allocated before. However, after the control flow goesthrough the following call chains: kv_parse_power_table |-> kv_dpm_init |->kv_dpm_sw_init |-> kv_dpm_fini The adev->pm.dpm.ps is used in the for loopof kv_dpm_fini after its first free in kv_parse_power_table and causes ause-after-free bug.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52469` to fix the vulnerability.
