		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:marvell: prestera: fix port event handling on init For some reason theremight be a crash during ports creation if port events are handling at thesame time because fw may send initial port event with down state. The crashpoints to cancel_delayed_work() which is called when port went is down.Currently I did not find out the real cause of the issue, so fixed it bycancel port stats work only if previous port's state was up & runnig. Thefollowing is the crash which can be triggered: [ 28.311104] Unable tohandle kernel paging request at virtual address 000071775f776600 [28.319097] Mem abort info: [ 28.321914] ESR = 0x96000004 [ 28.324996] EC =0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [ 28.330350] SET = 0, FnV = 0 [28.333430] EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [ 28.336597] Data abort info: [ 28.339499] ISV= 0, ISS = 0x00000004 [ 28.343362] CM = 0, WnR = 0 [ 28.346354] userpgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000100bf7000 [ 28.352842][000071775f776600] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 [ 28.359695]Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP [ 28.365310] Modules linkedin: prestera_pci(+) prestera uio_pdrv_genirq [ 28.372005] CPU: 0 PID: 1291Comm: kworker/0:1H Not tainted 5.11.0-rc4 #1 [ 28.378846] Hardware name:DNI AmazonGo1 A7040 board (DT) [ 28.384283] Workqueue: prestera_fw_wqprestera_fw_evt_work_fn [prestera_pci] [ 28.391413] pstate: 60000085 (nZCvdaIf -PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--) [ 28.397468] pc : get_work_pool+0x48/0x60 [28.401442] lr : try_to_grab_pending+0x6c/0x1b0 [ 28.406018] sp :ffff80001391bc60 [ 28.409358] x29: ffff80001391bc60 x28: 0000000000000000 [28.414725] x27: ffff000104fc8b40 x26: ffff80001127de88 [ 28.420089] x25:0000000000000000 x24: ffff000106119760 [ 28.425452] x23: ffff00010775dd60x22: ffff00010567e000 [ 28.430814] x21: 0000000000000000 x20:ffff80001391bcb0 [ 28.436175] x19: ffff00010775deb8 x18: 00000000000000c0 [28.441537] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 000000008d9b0e88 [ 28.446898] x15:0000000000000001 x14: 00000000000002ba [ 28.452261] x13: 80a3002c00000002x12: 00000000000005f4 [ 28.457622] x11: 0000000000000030 x10:000000000000000c [ 28.462985] x9 : 000000000000000c x8 : 0000000000000030 [28.468346] x7 : ffff800014400000 x6 : ffff000106119758 [ 28.473708] x5 :0000000000000003 x4 : ffff00010775dc60 [ 28.479068] x3 : 0000000000000000x2 : 0000000000000060 [ 28.484429] x1 : 000071775f776600 x0 :ffff00010775deb8 [ 28.489791] Call trace: [ 28.492259]get_work_pool+0x48/0x60 [ 28.495874] cancel_delayed_work+0x38/0xb0 [28.500011] prestera_port_handle_event+0x90/0xa0 [prestera] [ 28.505743]prestera_evt_recv+0x98/0xe0 [prestera] [ 28.510683]prestera_fw_evt_work_fn+0x180/0x228 [prestera_pci] [ 28.516660]process_one_work+0x1e8/0x360 [ 28.520710] worker_thread+0x44/0x480 [28.524412] kthread+0x154/0x160 [ 28.527670] ret_from_fork+0x10/0x38 [28.531290] Code: a8c17bfd d50323bf d65f03c0 9278dc21 (f9400020) [28.537429] ---[ end trace 5eced933df3a080b ]---",
