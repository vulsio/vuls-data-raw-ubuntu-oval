		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves Commit571e31fa60b3 (\"spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for->prepare_message()\") limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time.The limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare_cs[] inthe driver private data which contains a per-slave register value. Thecommit sought to enforce the limitation at run-time by setting thecontroller's num_chipselect to 3: Slaves with a higher chipselect arerejected by spi_add_device(). However the commit neglected thatnum_chipselect only limits the number of *native* chipselects. If GPIOchipselects are specified in the device tree for more than 3 slaves,num_chipselect is silently raised by of_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and theresult are out-of-bounds accesses to the statically-sized arrayprepare_cs[]. As a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable, raise thenumber of allowed slaves to 24 (which \"ought to be enough for anybody\"),enforce the limitation on slave ->setup and revert num_chipselect to 3(which is the number of native chipselects supported by the controller). Anupcoming for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves.",
