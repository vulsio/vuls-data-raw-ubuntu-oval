		"description": "A flaw was found in dmg2img through 20170502. fill_mishblk() does not checkthe length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The length ofthe buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads tomemory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in achain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.",
