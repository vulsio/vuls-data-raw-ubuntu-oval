		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:um: time-travel: fix time corruptionIn 'basic' time-travel mode (without =inf-cpu or =ext), westill get timer interrupts. These can happen at arbitrarypoints in time, i.e. while in timer_read(), which pushestime forward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to getthe interrupt after calculating the new time to push to,but before actually finishing that, the interrupt will setthe time to a value that's incompatible with the forward,and we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do theforwarding.Fix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating theadjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interruptsdisabled.",
