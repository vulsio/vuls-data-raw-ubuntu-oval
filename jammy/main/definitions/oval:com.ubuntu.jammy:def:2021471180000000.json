		"title": "CVE-2021-47118 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pid:take a reference when initializing `cad_pid` During boot,kernel_init_freeable() initializes `cad_pid` to the init task's struct pid.Later on, we may change `cad_pid` via a sysctl, and when this happensproc_do_cad_pid() will increment the refcount on the new pid via get_pid(),and will decrement the refcount on the old pid via put_pid(). As we nevercalled get_pid() when we initialized `cad_pid`, we decrement a reference wenever incremented, can therefore free the init task's struct pid early. Asthere can be dangling references to the struct pid, we can later encountera use-after-free (e.g. when delivering signals). This was spotted whenfuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to have been around since theconversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid in commit 9ec52099e4b8 (\"[PATCH]replace cad_pid by a struct pid\") from the pre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.Fix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when weassign it to `cad_pid`. Full KASAN splat below.================================================================== BUG:KASAN: use-after-free in ns_of_pid include/linux/pid.h:153 [inline] BUG:KASAN: use-after-free in task_active_pid_ns+0xc0/0xc8 kernel/pid.c:509 Readof size 4 at addr ffff23794dda0004 by task syz-executor.0/273 CPU: 1 PID:273 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted 5.12.0-00001-g9aef892b2d15 #1 Hardwarename: linux,dummy-virt (DT) Call trace: ns_of_pid include/linux/pid.h:153[inline] task_active_pid_ns+0xc0/0xc8 kernel/pid.c:509do_notify_parent+0x308/0xe60 kernel/signal.c:1950 exit_notifykernel/exit.c:682 [inline] do_exit+0x2334/0x2bd0 kernel/exit.c:845do_group_exit+0x108/0x2c8 kernel/exit.c:922 get_signal+0x4e4/0x2a88kernel/signal.c:2781 do_signal arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:882 [inline]do_notify_resume+0x300/0x970 arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:936work_pending+0xc/0x2dc Allocated by task 0: slab_post_alloc_hook+0x50/0x5c0mm/slab.h:516 slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:2907 [inline] slab_allocmm/slub.c:2915 [inline] kmem_cache_alloc+0x1f4/0x4c0 mm/slub.c:2920alloc_pid+0xdc/0xc00 kernel/pid.c:180 copy_process+0x2794/0x5e18kernel/fork.c:2129 kernel_clone+0x194/0x13c8 kernel/fork.c:2500kernel_thread+0xd4/0x110 kernel/fork.c:2552 rest_init+0x44/0x4a0init/main.c:687 arch_call_rest_init+0x1c/0x28 start_kernel+0x520/0x554init/main.c:1064 0x0 Freed by task 270: slab_free_hook mm/slub.c:1562[inline] slab_free_freelist_hook+0x98/0x260 mm/slub.c:1600 slab_freemm/slub.c:3161 [inline] kmem_cache_free+0x224/0x8e0 mm/slub.c:3177put_pid.part.4+0xe0/0x1a8 kernel/pid.c:114 put_pid+0x30/0x48kernel/pid.c:109 proc_do_cad_pid+0x190/0x1b0 kernel/sysctl.c:1401proc_sys_call_handler+0x338/0x4b0 fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:591proc_sys_write+0x34/0x48 fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:617 call_write_iterinclude/linux/fs.h:1977 [inline] new_sync_write+0x3ac/0x510fs/read_write.c:518 vfs_write fs/read_write.c:605 [inline]vfs_write+0x9c4/0x1018 fs/read_write.c:585 ksys_write+0x124/0x240fs/read_write.c:658 __do_sys_write fs/read_write.c:670 [inline]__se_sys_write fs/read_write.c:667 [inline] __arm64_sys_write+0x78/0xb0fs/read_write.c:667 __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:37[inline] invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:49 [inline]el0_svc_common.constprop.1+0x16c/0x388 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:129do_el0_svc+0xf8/0x150 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:168 el0_svc+0x28/0x38arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:416 el0_sync_handler+0x134/0x180arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:432 el0_sync+0x154/0x180arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:701 The buggy address belongs to the object atffff23794dda0000 which belongs to the cache pid of size 224 The buggyaddress is located 4 bytes inside of 224-byte region [ff ---truncated---",
