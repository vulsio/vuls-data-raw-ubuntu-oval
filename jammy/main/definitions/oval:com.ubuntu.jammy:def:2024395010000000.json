		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers: core: synchronize really_probe() and dev_uevent()Synchronize the dev->driver usage in really_probe() and dev_uevent().These can run in different threads, what can result in the followingrace condition for dev->driver uninitialization:Thread #1:==========really_probe() {...probe_failed:...device_unbind_cleanup(dev) {    ...    dev->driver = NULL;   // <= Failed probe sets dev->driver to NULL    ...    }...}Thread #2:==========dev_uevent() {...if (dev->driver)      // If dev->driver is NULLed from really_probe() from here on,      // after above check, the system crashes      add_uevent_var(env, \"DRIVER=%s\", dev->driver->name);...}really_probe() holds the lock, already. So nothing needs to be donethere. dev_uevent() is called with lock held, often, too. But notalways. What implies that we can't add any locking in dev_uevent()itself. So fix this race by adding the lock to the non-protectedpath. This is the path where above race is observed: dev_uevent+0x235/0x380 uevent_show+0x10c/0x1f0  <= Add lock here dev_attr_show+0x3a/0xa0 sysfs_kf_seq_show+0x17c/0x250 kernfs_seq_show+0x7c/0x90 seq_read_iter+0x2d7/0x940 kernfs_fop_read_iter+0xc6/0x310 vfs_read+0x5bc/0x6b0 ksys_read+0xeb/0x1b0 __x64_sys_read+0x42/0x50 x64_sys_call+0x27ad/0x2d30 do_syscall_64+0xcd/0x1d0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7fSimilar cases are reported by syzkaller inhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ffa8143439596313a85aBut these are regarding the *initialization* of dev->driverdev->driver = drv;As this switches dev->driver to non-NULL these reports can be consideredto be false-positives (which should be \"fixed\" by this commit, as well,though).The same issue was reported and tried to be fixed back in 2015 inhttps://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1421259054-2574-1-git-send-email-a.sangwan@samsung.com/already.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39501` to fix the vulnerability.
