		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: br_netfilter: skip conntrack input hook for promisc packets Forhistorical reasons, when bridge device is in promisc mode, packets that aredirected to the taps follow bridge input hook path. This patch adds aworkaround to reset conntrack for these packets. Jianbo Liu reports warningsplats in their test infrastructure where cloned packets reach thebr_netfilter input hook to confirm the conntrack object. Scratch one bitfrom BR_INPUT_SKB_CB to annotate that this packet has reached the inputhook because it is passed up to the bridge device to reach the taps.
