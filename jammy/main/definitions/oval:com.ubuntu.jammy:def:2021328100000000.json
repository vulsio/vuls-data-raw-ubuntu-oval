		"description": "crossbeam-deque is a package of work-stealing deques for building taskschedulers when programming in Rust. In versions prior to 0.7.4 and 0.8.0,the result of the race condition is that one or more tasks in the workerqueue can be popped twice instead of other tasks that are forgotten andnever popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this can cause doublefree and a memory leak. If not, this still can cause a logical bug. Cratesusing `Stealer::steal`, `Stealer::steal_batch`, or`Stealer::steal_batch_and_pop` are affected by this issue. This has beenfixed in crossbeam-deque 0.8.1 and 0.7.4.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32810` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 93.0+build1-0ubuntu2\nfirefox-geckodriver - 93.0+build1-0ubuntu2\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 93.0+build1-0ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
