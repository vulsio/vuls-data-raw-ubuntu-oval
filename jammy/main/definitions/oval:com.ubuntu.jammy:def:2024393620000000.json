		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i2c: acpi: Unbind mux adapters before deleteThere is an issue with ACPI overlay table removal specifically relatedto I2C multiplexers.Consider an ACPI SSDT Overlay that defines a PCA9548 I2C mux on anexisting I2C bus. When this table is loaded we see the creation of adevice for the overall PCA9548 chip and 8 further devices - onei2c_adapter each for the mux channels. These are all bound to theirACPI equivalents via an eventual invocation of acpi_bind_one().When we unload the SSDT overlay we run into the problem. The ACPIdevices are deleted as normal via acpi_device_del_work_fn() and theacpi_device_del_list.However, the following warning and stack trace is output as thedeletion does not go smoothly:------------[ cut here ]------------kernfs: can not remove 'physical_node', no directoryWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 11 at fs/kernfs/dir.c:1674kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0Modules linked in:CPU: 1 PID: 11 Comm: kworker/u128:0 Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6+ #1Hardware name: congatec AG conga-B7E3/conga-B7E3, BIOS 5.13 05/16/2023Workqueue: kacpi_hotplug acpi_device_del_work_fnRIP: 0010:kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0Code: e4 00 48 89 ef e8 07 71 db ff 5b b8 fe ff ff ff 5d 41 5c 41 5d e9 a755 e4 00 0f 0b eb a6 48 c7 c7 f0 38 0d 9d e8 97 0a d5 ff <0f> 0b eb dc 0f1f 00 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90RSP: 0018:ffff9f864008fb28 EFLAGS: 00010286RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff8ef90a8d4940 RCX: 0000000000000000RDX: ffff8f000e267d10 RSI: ffff8f000e25c780 RDI: ffff8f000e25c780RBP: ffff8ef9186f9870 R08: 0000000000013ffb R09: 00000000ffffbfffR10: 00000000ffffbfff R11: ffff8f000e0a0000 R12: ffff9f864008fb50R13: ffff8ef90c93dd60 R14: ffff8ef9010d0958 R15: ffff8ef9186f98c8FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8f000e240000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007f48f5253a08 CR3: 00000003cb82e000 CR4: 00000000003506f0Call Trace: <TASK> ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0 ? __warn+0x7c/0x130 ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0 ? report_bug+0x171/0x1a0 ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0 ? kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0xb9/0xc0 acpi_unbind_one+0x108/0x180 device_del+0x18b/0x490 ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f device_unregister+0xd/0x30 i2c_del_adapter.part.0+0x1bf/0x250 i2c_mux_del_adapters+0xa1/0xe0 i2c_device_remove+0x1e/0x80 device_release_driver_internal+0x19a/0x200 bus_remove_device+0xbf/0x100 device_del+0x157/0x490 ? __pfx_device_match_fwnode+0x10/0x10 ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f device_unregister+0xd/0x30 i2c_acpi_notify+0x10f/0x140 notifier_call_chain+0x58/0xd0 blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x3a/0x60 acpi_device_del_work_fn+0x85/0x1d0 process_one_work+0x134/0x2f0 worker_thread+0x2f0/0x410 ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10 kthread+0xe3/0x110 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork+0x2f/0x50 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 </TASK>---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---...repeated 7 more times, 1 for each channel of the mux...The issue is that the binding of the ACPI devices to their peer I2Cadapters is not correctly cleaned up. Digging deeper into the issue wesee that the deletion order is such that the ACPI devices matching themux channel i2c adapters are deleted first during the SSDT overlayremoval. For each of the channels we see a call to i2c_acpi_notify()with ACPI_RECONFIG_DEVICE_REMOVE but, because these devices are notactually i2c_clients, nothing is done for them.Later on, after each of the mux channels has been dealt with, we cometo delete the i2c_client representing the PCA9548 device. This is thecall stack we see above, whereby the kernel cleans up the i2c_clientincluding destruction of the mux and its channel adapters. At thispoint we do attempt to unbind from the ACPI peers but those peers---truncated---",
