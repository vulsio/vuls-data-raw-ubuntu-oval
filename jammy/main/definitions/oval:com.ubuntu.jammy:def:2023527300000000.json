		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mmc: sdio: fix possible resource leaks in some error pathsIf sdio_add_func() or sdio_init_func() fails, sdio_remove_func() cannot release the resources, because the sdio function is not presentedin these two cases, it won't call of_node_put() or put_device().To fix these leaks, make sdio_func_present() only control whetherdevice_del() needs to be called or not, then always call of_node_put()and put_device().In error case in sdio_init_func(), the reference of 'card->dev' isnot get, to avoid redundant put in sdio_free_func_cis(), move theget_device() to sdio_alloc_func() and put_device() to sdio_release_func(),it can keep the get/put function be balanced.Without this patch, while doing fault inject test, it can get thefollowing leak reports, after this fix, the leak is gone.unreferenced object 0xffff888112514000 (size 2048):  comm \"kworker/3:2\", pid 65, jiffies 4294741614 (age 124.774s)  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    00 e0 6f 12 81 88 ff ff 60 58 8d 06 81 88 ff ff  ..o.....`X......    10 40 51 12 81 88 ff ff 10 40 51 12 81 88 ff ff  .@Q......@Q.....  backtrace:    [<000000009e5931da>] kmalloc_trace+0x21/0x110    [<000000002f839ccb>] mmc_alloc_card+0x38/0xb0 [mmc_core]    [<0000000004adcbf6>] mmc_sdio_init_card+0xde/0x170 [mmc_core]    [<000000007538fea0>] mmc_attach_sdio+0xcb/0x1b0 [mmc_core]    [<00000000d4fdeba7>] mmc_rescan+0x54a/0x640 [mmc_core]unreferenced object 0xffff888112511000 (size 2048):  comm \"kworker/3:2\", pid 65, jiffies 4294741623 (age 124.766s)  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    00 40 51 12 81 88 ff ff e0 58 8d 06 81 88 ff ff  .@Q......X......    10 10 51 12 81 88 ff ff 10 10 51 12 81 88 ff ff  ..Q.......Q.....  backtrace:    [<000000009e5931da>] kmalloc_trace+0x21/0x110    [<00000000fcbe706c>] sdio_alloc_func+0x35/0x100 [mmc_core]    [<00000000c68f4b50>] mmc_attach_sdio.cold.18+0xb1/0x395 [mmc_core]    [<00000000d4fdeba7>] mmc_rescan+0x54a/0x640 [mmc_core]",
