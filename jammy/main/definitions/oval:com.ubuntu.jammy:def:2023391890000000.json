		"Title": "CVE-2023-39189 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The nfnl_osf_add_callback function did not validate the user mode controlled opt_num field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure. Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39189` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1025-oem - 6.1.0-1025.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1025-oem - 6.1.0-1025.25\nNo subscription required",
