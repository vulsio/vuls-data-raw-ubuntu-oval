		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ixgbe_xdp_setupThe ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference withsome machine (online cpus < 63). This is due to the fact that themaximum value of num_xdp_queues is nr_cpu_ids. Code is in\"ixgbe_set_rss_queues\"\".Here's how the problem repeats itself:Some machine (online cpus < 63), And user set num_queues to 63 throughethtool. Code is in the \"ixgbe_set_channels\",\tadapter->ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR].limit = count;It becomes 63.When user use xdp, \"ixgbe_set_rss_queues\" will set queues num.\tadapter->num_rx_queues = rss_i;\tadapter->num_tx_queues = rss_i;\tadapter->num_xdp_queues = ixgbe_xdp_queues(adapter);And rss_i's value is from\tf = &adapter->ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR];\trss_i = f->indices = f->limit;So \"num_rx_queues\" > \"num_xdp_queues\", when run to \"ixgbe_xdp_setup\",\tfor (i = 0; i < adapter->num_rx_queues; i++)\t\tif (adapter->xdp_ring[i]->xsk_umem)It leads to panic.Call trace:[exception RIP: ixgbe_xdp+368]RIP: ffffffffc02a76a0  RSP: ffff9fe16202f8d0  RFLAGS: 00010297RAX: 0000000000000000  RBX: 0000000000000020  RCX: 0000000000000000RDX: 0000000000000000  RSI: 000000000000001c  RDI: ffffffffa94ead90RBP: ffff92f8f24c0c18   R8: 0000000000000000   R9: 0000000000000000R10: ffff9fe16202f830  R11: 0000000000000000  R12: ffff92f8f24c0000R13: ffff9fe16202fc01  R14: 000000000000000a  R15: ffffffffc02a7530ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff  CS: 0010  SS: 0018 7 [ffff9fe16202f8f0] dev_xdp_install at ffffffffa89fbbcc 8 [ffff9fe16202f920] dev_change_xdp_fd at ffffffffa8a08808 9 [ffff9fe16202f960] do_setlink at ffffffffa8a2023510 [ffff9fe16202fa88] rtnl_setlink at ffffffffa8a2038411 [ffff9fe16202fc78] rtnetlink_rcv_msg at ffffffffa8a1a8dd12 [ffff9fe16202fcf0] netlink_rcv_skb at ffffffffa8a717eb13 [ffff9fe16202fd40] netlink_unicast at ffffffffa8a70f8814 [ffff9fe16202fd80] netlink_sendmsg at ffffffffa8a7131915 [ffff9fe16202fdf0] sock_sendmsg at ffffffffa89df29016 [ffff9fe16202fe08] __sys_sendto at ffffffffa89e19c817 [ffff9fe16202ff30] __x64_sys_sendto at ffffffffa89e1a6418 [ffff9fe16202ff38] do_syscall_64 at ffffffffa84042b919 [ffff9fe16202ff50] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe at ffffffffa8c0008cSo I fix ixgbe_max_channels so that it will not allow a setting of queuesto be higher than the num_online_cpus().
