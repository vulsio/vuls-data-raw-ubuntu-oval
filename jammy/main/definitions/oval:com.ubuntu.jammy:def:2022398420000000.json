		"Title": "CVE-2022-39842 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the PXA3xx graphics driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39842` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic-64k - 5.15.0-57.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-aws - 5.15.0-1027.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1030.37.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gcp - 5.15.0-1026.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1024-gke - 5.15.0-1024.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1012-gkeop - 5.15.0-1012.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-ibm - 5.15.0-1022.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-kvm - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-lowlatency - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-57.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-oracle - 5.15.0-1026.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1022-raspi - 5.15.0-1022.24\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic-64k - 5.15.0-57.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-aws - 5.15.0-1027.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1030.37.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gcp - 5.15.0-1026.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1024-gke - 5.15.0-1024.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1012-gkeop - 5.15.0-1012.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-ibm - 5.15.0-1022.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-kvm - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-lowlatency - 5.15.0-57.63\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-57.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-oracle - 5.15.0-1026.32\nNo subscription required",
