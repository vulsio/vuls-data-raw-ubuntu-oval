		"Description": "NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1, is vulnerable to anovel type of the \"ghost domain names\" attack. The vulnerability works bytargeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a rogue domain namewhen the cached delegation information is about to expire. The roguenameserver delays the response so that the cached delegation information isexpired. Upon receiving the delayed answer containing the delegationinformation, Unbound overwrites the now expired entries. This action can berepeated when the delegation information is about to expire making therogue delegation information ever-updating. From version 1.16.2 on, Unboundstores the start time for a query and uses that to decide if the cacheddelegation information can be overwritten.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-30699` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibunbound8 - 1.13.1-1ubuntu5.1\npython3-unbound - 1.13.1-1ubuntu5.1\nunbound - 1.13.1-1ubuntu5.1\nunbound-anchor - 1.13.1-1ubuntu5.1\nunbound-host - 1.13.1-1ubuntu5.1\nNo subscription required",
