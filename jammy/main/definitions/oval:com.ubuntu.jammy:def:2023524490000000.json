However,gluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in theftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBIvolume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi fromcreating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of thetype MTD_UBIVOLUME.",
