		"Title": "CVE-2020-10755 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low",
		"Description": "An insecure-credentials flaw was found in all openstack-cinder versionsbefore openstack-cinder 14.1.0, all openstack-cinder 15.x.x versions beforeopenstack-cinder 15.2.0 and all openstack-cinder 16.x.x versions beforeopenstack-cinder 16.1.0. When using openstack-cinder with the Dell EMCScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver, credentials for the entirebackend are exposed in the ``connection_info`` element in all Block Storagev3 Attachments API calls containing that element. This flaw enables anend-user to create a volume, make an API call to show the attachment detailinformation, and retrieve a username and password that may be used toconnect to another user's volume. Additionally, these credentials are validfor the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discoverthe Management API endpoint. Source: OpenStack project",
