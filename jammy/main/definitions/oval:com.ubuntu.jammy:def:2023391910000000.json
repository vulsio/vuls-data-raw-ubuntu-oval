		"Title": "CVE-2023-39191 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "An improper input validation flaw was found in the eBPF subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue occurs due to a lack of proper validation of dynamic pointers within user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. This may allow an attacker with CAP_BPF privileges to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39191` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic-64k - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-lowlatency - 5.13.0-19.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1005-aws - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1006-azure - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1005-gcp - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gke - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1004-kvm - 5.13.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency - 5.15.0-22.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-22.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia - 5.15.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia-64k - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-oracle - 5.13.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-raspi - 5.13.0-1008.9\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-raspi-nolpae - 5.13.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-5.13.0-19-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-generic-64k - 5.13.0-19.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-19-lowlatency - 5.13.0-19.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1005-aws - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1006-azure - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.13.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1005-gcp - 5.13.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gke - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1004-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1004-kvm - 5.13.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency - 5.15.0-22.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-22-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-22.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia - 5.15.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-nvidia-64k - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-oracle - 5.13.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required",
