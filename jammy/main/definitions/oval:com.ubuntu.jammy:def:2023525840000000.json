		"title": "CVE-2023-52584 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spmi:mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove The pmif driver data that contains theclocks is allocated along with spmi_controller. On device remove,spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres , including theclocks, will be cleanup. This leads to UAF because putting the clocks willaccess the clocks in the pmif driver data, which is already freed alongwith spmi_controller. This can be reproduced by enablingDEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and building the kernel with KASAN. Fix the UAFissue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the clocks beforefreeing spmi_controller.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52584` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic-64k - 6.5.0-41.41~22.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-azure - 6.5.0-1022.23~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-gcp - 6.5.0-1022.24~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency - 6.5.0-41.41.1~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-41.41.1~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1035-oem - 6.1.0-1035.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-oem - 6.5.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1015-starfive - 6.5.0-1015.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1021-nvidia - 6.5.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1021-nvidia-64k - 6.5.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required",
