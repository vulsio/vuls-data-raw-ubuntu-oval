		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: conntrack: serialize hash resizes and cleanups Syzbot was ableto trigger the following warning [1] No repro found by syzbot yet but I wasable to trigger similar issue by having 2 scripts running in parallel,changing conntrack hash sizes, and: for j in `seq 1 1000` ; do unshare -n/bin/true >/dev/null ; done It would take more than 5 minutes fornet_namespace structures to be cleaned up. This is becausenf_ct_iterate_cleanup() has to restart everytime a resize happened. Byadding a mutex, we can serialize hash resizes and cleanups and also makeget_next_corpse() faster by skipping over empty buckets. Even withoutresizes in the picture, this patch considerably speeds up network namespacedismantles.
