		"Title": "CVE-2022-47520 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing offset validation in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/hif.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds read when parsing a Robust Security Network (RSN) information element from a Netlink packet. It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-47520` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gkeop - 5.15.0-1016.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-ibm - 5.15.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-kvm - 5.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1028-oem - 5.17.0-1028.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1025-raspi - 5.15.0-1025.27\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1025-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gkeop - 5.15.0-1016.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-35-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-35-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-ibm - 5.15.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-kvm - 5.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1028-oem - 5.17.0-1028.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1012-oem - 6.0.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36\nNo subscription required",
