		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nexthop: Fix division by zero while replacing a resilient group Theresilient nexthop group torture tests in fib_nexthop.sh exposed a possibledivision by zero while replacing a resilient group [1]. The division byzero occurs when the data path sees a resilient nexthop group with zerobuckets. The tests replace a resilient nexthop group in a loop whiletraffic is forwarded through it. The tests do not specify the number ofbuckets while performing the replacement, resulting in the kernelallocating a stub resilient table (i.e, 'struct nh_res_table') with zerobuckets. This table should never be visible to the data path, but the oldnexthop group (i.e., 'oldg') might still be used by the data path when thestub table is assigned to it. Fix this by only assigning the stub table tothe old nexthop group after making sure the group is no longer used by thedata path. Tested with fib_nexthops.sh: Tests passed: 222 Tests failed: 0[1] divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN CPU: 0 PID: 1850 Comm: pingNot tainted 5.14.0-custom-10271-ga86eb53057fe #1107 Hardware name: QEMUStandard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-4.fc34 04/01/2014 RIP:0010:nexthop_select_path+0x2d2/0x1a80 [...] Call Trace:fib_select_multipath+0x79b/0x1530 fib_select_path+0x8fb/0x1c10ip_route_output_key_hash_rcu+0x1198/0x2da0ip_route_output_key_hash+0x190/0x340 ip_route_output_flow+0x21/0x120raw_sendmsg+0x91d/0x2e10 inet_sendmsg+0x9e/0xe0 __sys_sendto+0x23d/0x360__x64_sys_sendto+0xe1/0x1b0 do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae",
