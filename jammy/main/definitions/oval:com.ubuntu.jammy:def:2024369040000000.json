		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tcp:Use refcount_inc_not_zero() in tcp_twsk_unique(). Anderson Nascimentoreported a use-after-free splat in tcp_twsk_unique() with nice analysis.Since commit ec94c2696f0b (\"tcp/dccp: avoid one atomic operation fortimewait hashdance\"), inet_twsk_hashdance() sets TIME-WAIT socket'ssk_refcnt after putting it into ehash and releasing the bucket lock. Thus,there is a small race window where other threads could try to reuse theport during connect() and call sock_hold() in tcp_twsk_unique() for theTIME-WAIT socket with zero refcnt. If that happens, the refcnt taken bytcp_twsk_unique() is overwritten and sock_put() will cause underflow,triggering a real use-after-free somewhere else. To avoid theuse-after-free, we need to use refcount_inc_not_zero() in tcp_twsk_unique()and give up on reusing the port if it returns false. [0]: refcount_t:addition on 0; use-after-free.
