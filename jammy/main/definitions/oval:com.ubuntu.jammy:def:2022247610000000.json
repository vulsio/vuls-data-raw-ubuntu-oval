		"description": "Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. Whenusing Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does notproperly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard,Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request startsand where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via thefront-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes ofvulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by thisadvisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers,leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, whereas the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hexdigits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it wasdiscarding them without validating that they did not contain illegalcharacters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. Aworkaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress,turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matchesthe RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionalitythough and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version ofwaitress instead.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24761` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-waitress - 1.4.4-1.1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
