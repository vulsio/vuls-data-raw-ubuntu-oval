Looking at thebacktrace, the illegal instruction is encountered in this same function.However, patch_text_nosync, after patching the instructions, callsflush_icache_range. But looking at what happens in this function:flush_icache_range -> flush_icache_all                   -> sbi_remote_fence_i                   -> __sbi_rfence_v02                   -> riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_maskThe icache and dcache of the current cpu are never synchronized between thepatching of riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask and calling this same function.So fix this by flushing the current cpu's icache before asking for theothercpus to do the same.",
