		"description": "Vim is an open source command line text editor. When performing a searchand displaying the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S), thesearch pattern is displayed at the bottom of the screen in a buffer(msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled, the search pattern isreversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search patterncontains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smallerthan the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversedbuffer, the strlen() function is called, which only counts until it noticesan ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. Thiscauses an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by thepreviously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as ofVim patch v9.1.0689.",
