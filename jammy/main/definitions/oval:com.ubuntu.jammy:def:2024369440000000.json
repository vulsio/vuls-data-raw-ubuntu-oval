		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Reapply \"drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait\"This reverts commit 07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea.Stephen Rostedt reports: \"I went to run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up.  Unfortunately, the most I ever got out was:  [   93.607888] Testing event system initcall: OK  [   93.667730] Running tests on all trace events:  [   93.669757] Testing all events: OK  [   95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------  Timed out after 60 seconds\"and further debugging points to a possible circular locking dependencybetween the console_owner locking and the worker pool locking.Reverting the commit allows Steve's VM to boot to completion again.[ This may obviously result in the \"[TTM] Buffer eviction failed\"  messages again, which was the reason for that original revert. But at  this point this seems preferable to a non-booting system... ]",
