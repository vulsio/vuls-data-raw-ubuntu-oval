		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags act_ct addsskb->users before defragmentation. If frags arrive in order, the lastfrag's reference is reset in: inet_frag_reasm_prepare skb_morph which isnot straightforward. However when frags arrive out of order, nobody unrefthe last frag, and all frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, asinitiating packet capture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been clonedand shared at the same time. Fix the issue by removing skb_get() beforedefragmentation. act_ct returns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or inprogress.
