Inversions of the sentry python library prior to 22.11.0 an attacker with aknown valid invite link could manipulate a cookie to allow the same invitelink to be reused on multiple accounts when joining an organization.

Sentry SaaS customers do not need totake action. Self-hosted Sentry installs on systems which can not upgradecan disable the invite functionality until they are ready to deploy thepatched version by editing their `sentry.conf.py` file (usually located at`~/.sentry/`).",
