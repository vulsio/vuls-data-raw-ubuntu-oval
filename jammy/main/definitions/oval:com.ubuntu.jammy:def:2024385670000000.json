		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:carl9170: add a proper sanity check for endpoints Syzkaller reports [1]hitting a warning which is caused by presence of a wrong endpoint type atthe URB sumbitting stage. While there was a check for a specific 4thendpoint, since it can switch types between bulk and interrupt, otherendpoints are trusted implicitly. Similar warning is triggered in a coupleof other syzbot issues [2]. Fix the issue by doing a comprehensive check ofall endpoints taking into account difference between high- and full-speedconfiguration. [1] Syzkaller report: ...
