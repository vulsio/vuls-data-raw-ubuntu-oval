		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:mvneta: fix calls to page_pool_get_stats Calling page_pool_get_stats in themvneta driver without checks leads to kernel crashes. First the page poolis only available if the bm is not used. The page pool is also notallocated when the port is stopped. It can also be not allocated in case oferrors. The current implementation leads to the following crash callingethstats on a port that is down or when calling it at the wrong moment: bleto handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000070[00000070] *pgd=00000000 Internal error: Oops: 5 [#1] SMP ARM Hardwarename: Marvell Armada 380/385 (Device Tree) PC is atpage_pool_get_stats+0x18/0x1cc LR is at mvneta_ethtool_get_stats+0xa0/0xe0[mvneta] pc : [<c0b413cc>] lr : [<bf0a98d8>] psr: a0000013 sp : f1439d48 ip: f1439dc0 fp : 0000001d r10: 00000100 r9 : c4816b80 r8 : f0d75150 r7 :bf0b400c r6 : c238f000 r5 : 00000000 r4 : f1439d68 r3 : c2091040 r2 :ffffffd8 r1 : f1439d68 r0 : 00000000 Flags: NzCv IRQs on FIQs on ModeSVC_32 ISA ARM Segment none Control: 10c5387d Table: 066b004a DAC: 00000051Register r0 information: NULL pointer Register r1 information: 2-pagevmalloc region starting at 0xf1438000 allocated at kernel_clone+0x9c/0x390Register r2 information: non-paged memory Register r3 information: slabkmalloc-2k start c2091000 pointer offset 64 size 2048 Register r4information: 2-page vmalloc region starting at 0xf1438000 allocated atkernel_clone+0x9c/0x390 Register r5 information: NULL pointer Register r6information: slab kmalloc-cg-4k start c238f000 pointer offset 0 size 4096Register r7 information: 15-page vmalloc region starting at 0xbf0a8000allocated at load_module+0xa30/0x219c Register r8 information: 1-pagevmalloc region starting at 0xf0d75000 allocated atethtool_get_stats+0x138/0x208 Register r9 information: slab task_structstart c4816b80 pointer offset 0 Register r10 information: non-paged memoryRegister r11 information: non-paged memory Register r12 information: 2-pagevmalloc region starting at 0xf1438000 allocated at kernel_clone+0x9c/0x390Process snmpd (pid: 733, stack limit = 0x38de3a88) Stack: (0xf1439d48 to0xf143a000) 9d40: 000000c0 00000001 c238f000 bf0b400c f0d75150 c4816b809d60: 00000100 bf0a98d8 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000000000000000 9d80: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000000000000000 00000000 9da0: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000000000000000 00000000 00000000 9dc0: 00000dc0 5335509c 00000035 c238f000bf0b2214 01067f50 f0d75000 c0b9b9c8 9de0: 0000001d 00000035 c22120945335509c c4816b80 c238f000 c5ad6e00 01067f50 9e00: c1b0be80 c4816b8000014813 c0b9d7f0 00000000 00000000 0000001d 0000001d 9e20: 0000000000001200 00000000 00000000 c216ed90 c73943b8 00000000 00000000 9e40:00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 000000009e60: 00000000 c0ad9034 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000000000000000 9e80: 00000000 00000000 00000000 5335509c c1b0be80 f1439ee400008946 c1b0be80 9ea0: 01067f50 f1439ee3 00000000 00000046 b6d77ae0c0b383f0 00008946 becc83e8 9ec0: c1b0be80 00000051 0000000b c68ca480c7172d00 c0ad8ff0 f1439ee3 cf600e40 9ee0: 01600e40 32687465 0000000000000000 00000000 01067f50 00000000 00000000 9f00: 00000000 5335509c00008946 00008946 00000000 c68ca480 becc83e8 c05e2de0 9f20: f1439fb0c03002f0 00000006 5ac3c35a c4816b80 00000006 b6d77ae0 c030caf0 9f40:c4817350 00000014 f1439e1c 0000000c 00000000 00000051 01000000 000000149f60: 00003fec f1439edc 00000001 c0372abc b6d77ae0 c0372abc cf600e405335509c 9f80: c21e6800 01015c9c 0000000b 00008946 00000036 c03002f0c4816b80 00000036 9fa0: b6d77ae0 c03000c0 01015c9c 0000000b 0000000b00008946 becc83e8 00000000 9fc0: 01015c9c 0000000b 00008946 0000003600000035 010678a0 b6d797ec b6d77ae0 9fe0: b6dbf738 becc838c b6d186d7b6baa858 40000030 0000000b 00000000 00000000 page_pool_get_s---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52780` to fix the vulnerability.
