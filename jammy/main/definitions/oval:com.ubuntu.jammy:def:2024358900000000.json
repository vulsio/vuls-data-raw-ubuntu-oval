		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gro: fix ownership transferIf packets are GROed with fraglist they might be segmented later on andcontinue their journey in the stack. In skb_segment_list those skbs canbe reused as-is. This is an issue as their destructor was removed inskb_gro_receive_list but not the reference to their socket, and thenthey can't be orphaned. Fix this by also removing the reference to thesocket.For example this could be observed,  kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:3131!
