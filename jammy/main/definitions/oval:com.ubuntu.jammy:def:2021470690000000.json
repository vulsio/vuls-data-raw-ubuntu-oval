		"title": "CVE-2021-47069 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipc/mqueue, msg, sem: avoid relying on a stack reference past its expirydo_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with a stack local address. The sender(do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call pipelined_send. Thisleads to a very hard to trigger race where a do_mq_timedreceive call mightreturn and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely on an invalid address, causing thefollowing crash: RIP: 0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60 Call Trace:__x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490 do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9 RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343 The raceoccurs as: 1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address of `structext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr` here) - it holds avalid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the stack has not beenoverwritten. 2. `ewq_addr` gets added to info->e_wait_q[RECV].list inwq_add, and do_mq_timedsend receives it via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV)to call __pipelined_op. 3. Sender calls__pipelined_op::smp_store_release(&this->state, STATE_READY). Here is wherethe race window begins. (`this` is `ewq_addr`.) 4. If the receiver wakes upnow in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it will see `state == STATE_READY` andbreak. 5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and `ewq_addr` is no longerguaranteed to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *` since it was ondo_mq_timedreceive's stack. (Although the address may not get overwrittenuntil another function happens to touch it, which means it can persistaround for an indefinite time.) 6. do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() stillbelieves `ewq_addr` is a `struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find atask_struct to pass to the wake_q_add_safe call. In the lucky case wherenothing has overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr->task` is the righttask_struct. In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe getshanded a bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` aftersetting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to return.Change __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the receiver's task_structreturned by get_task_struct, instead of dereferencing `this` which sits onthe receiver's stack. As Manfred pointed out, the race potentially alsoexists in ipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare.Fix those in the same way.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47069` to fix the vulnerability.
