    "Title": "CVE-2022-33981 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function. Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33981` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-aws - 5.15.0-1015.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-azure - 5.15.0-1014.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1014.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-gcp - 5.15.0-1013.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gkeop - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1010-ibm - 5.15.0-1010.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-kvm - 5.15.0-1013.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-lowlatency - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-41.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1011-oem - 5.17.0-1011.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-oracle - 5.15.0-1013.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1012-raspi - 5.15.0-1012.14\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1012-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1012.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-aws - 5.15.0-1015.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-azure - 5.15.0-1014.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1014.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-gcp - 5.15.0-1013.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1002-gkeop - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1010-ibm - 5.15.0-1010.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1013.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-kvm - 5.15.0-1013.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-lowlatency - 5.15.0-41.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-41.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1011-oem - 5.17.0-1011.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-oracle - 5.15.0-1013.17\nNo subscription required",
