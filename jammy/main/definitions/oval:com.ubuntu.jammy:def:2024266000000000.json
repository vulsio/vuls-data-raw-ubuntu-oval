This can happen on an idle Ethernet gadgettriggering a wakeup for example: configfs-gadget.g1 gadget.0: ECM Suspendconfigfs-gadget.g1 gadget.0: Port suspended. Triggering wakeup ...

The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1035-oem - 6.1.0-1035.35\nNo subscription required",
