		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/vmscan: fix a bug calling wakeup_kswapd() with a wrong zone index Withnuma balancing on, when a numa system is running where a numa node doesn'thave its local memory so it has no managed zones, the following oops hasbeen observed. It's because wakeup_kswapd() is called with a wrong zoneindex, -1. Fixed it by checking the index before calling wakeup_kswapd(). >BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 00000000000033f3 > #PF:supervisor read access in kernel mode > #PF: error_code(0x0000) -not-present page > PGD 0 P4D 0 > Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI > CPU: 2PID: 895 Comm: masim Not tainted 6.6.0-dirty #255 > Hardware name: QEMUStandard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS >rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014 > RIP:0010:wakeup_kswapd (./linux/mm/vmscan.c:7812) > Code: (omitted) > RSP:0000:ffffc90004257d58 EFLAGS: 00010286 > RAX: ffffffffffffffff RBX:ffff88883fff0480 RCX: 0000000000000003 > RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI:0000000000000000 RDI: ffff88883fff0480 > RBP: ffffffffffffffff R08:ff0003ffffffffff R09: ffffffffffffffff > R10: ffff888106c95540 R11:0000000055555554 R12: 0000000000000003 > R13: 0000000000000000 R14:0000000000000000 R15: ffff88883fff0940 > FS: 00007fc4b8124740(0000)GS:ffff888827c00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 > CS: 0010 DS: 0000 ES:0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 > CR2: 00000000000033f3 CR3: 000000026cc08004CR4: 0000000000770ee0 > DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2:0000000000000000 > DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7:0000000000000400 > PKRU: 55555554 > Call Trace: > <TASK> > ? __die > ?page_fault_oops > ? __pte_offset_map_lock > ? exc_page_fault > ?asm_exc_page_fault > ? wakeup_kswapd > migrate_misplaced_page >__handle_mm_fault > handle_mm_fault > do_user_addr_fault > exc_page_fault >asm_exc_page_fault > RIP: 0033:0x55b897ba0808 > Code: (omitted) > RSP:002b:00007ffeefa821a0 EFLAGS: 00010287 > RAX: 000055b89983acd0 RBX:00007ffeefa823f8 RCX: 000055b89983acd0 > RDX: 00007fc2f8122010 RSI:0000000000020000 RDI: 000055b89983acd0 > RBP: 00007ffeefa821a0 R08:0000000000000037 R09: 0000000000000075 > R10: 0000000000000000 R11:0000000000000202 R12: 0000000000000000 > R13: 00007ffeefa82410 R14:000055b897ba5dd8 R15: 00007fc4b8340000 > </TASK>\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26783` to fix the vulnerability.
