Thismeans btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio functionfor both of the two halves. However scrub_submit_initial_read() would onlyexpect the endio function to be called once, not any more. This means thefirst endio function would already free the bbio::bio, leaving the bvecfreed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to use-after-free. [FIX] - Makesure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range Since we may readless than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not touch the bits beyondchunk boundary. - Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read thechunk range This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we needto read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio. Thankfully the scrub readrepair path won't need extra fixes: - scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk, thusscrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read beyond thechunk.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26616` to fix the vulnerability.
