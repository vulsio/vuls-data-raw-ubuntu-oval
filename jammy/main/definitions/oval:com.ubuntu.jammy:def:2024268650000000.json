		"title": "CVE-2024-26865 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: rds:tcp: Fix use-after-free of net in reqsk_timer_handler(). syzkaller reporteda warning of netns tracker [0] followed by KASAN splat [1] and another reftracker warning [1]. syzkaller could not find a repro, but in the log, theonly suspicious sequence was as follows: 18:26:22 executing program 1: r0 =socket$inet6_mptcp(0xa, 0x1, 0x106) ... connect$inet6(r0,&(0x7f0000000080)={0xa, 0x4001, 0x0, @loopback}, 0x1c) (async) The notablething here is 0x4001 in connect(), which is RDS_TCP_PORT. So, the scenariowould be: 1. unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) creates a per netns tcp listener inrds_tcp_listen_init(). 2. syz-executor connect()s to it and creates areqsk. 3. syz-executor exit()s immediately. 4. netns is dismantled. [0] 5.reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk. [1] 6. listeneris freed after RCU grace period. [2] Basically, reqsk assumes that thelistener guarantees netns safety until all reqsk timers are expired byholding the listener's refcount. However, this was not the case for kernelsockets. Commit 740ea3c4a0b2 (\"tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk ininet_twsk_purge()\") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash. Let's applythe same fix for the global ehash.
