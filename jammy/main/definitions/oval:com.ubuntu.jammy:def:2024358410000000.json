		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: tls, fix WARNIING in __sk_msg_freeA splice with MSG_SPLICE_PAGES will cause tls code to use thetls_sw_sendmsg_splice path in the TLS sendmsg code to move the userprovided pages from the msg into the msg_pl. This will loop over themsg until msg_pl is full, checked by sk_msg_full(msg_pl). The usercan also set the MORE flag to hint stack to delay sending until receivingmore pages and ideally a full buffer.If the user adds more pages to the msg than can fit in the msg_plscatterlist (MAX_MSG_FRAGS) we should ignore the MORE flag and sendthe buffer anyways.What actually happens though is we abort the msg to msg_pl scatterlistsetup and then because we forget to set 'full record' indicating wecan no longer consume data without a send we fallthrough to the 'continue'path which will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send andthen attempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then nextiteration of sender doing send will encounter a full msg_pl and throwthe warning in the syzbot report.To fix simply check if we have a full_record in splice code path andif not send the msg regardless of MORE flag.",
