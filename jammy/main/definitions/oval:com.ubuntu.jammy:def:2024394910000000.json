		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instanceThe cs_dsp instance is initialized in the driver probe() so itshould be freed in the driver remove(). Also fix a missing callto cs_dsp_remove() in the error path of cs35l56_hda_common_probe().The call to cs_dsp_remove() was being done in the component unbindcallback cs35l56_hda_unbind(). This meant that if the driver wasunbound and then re-bound it would be using an uninitialized cs_dspinstance.It is best to initialize the cs_dsp instance in probe() so that itcan return an error if it fails. The component binding API doesn'thave any error handling so there's no way to handle a failure ifcs_dsp was initialized in the bind.",
