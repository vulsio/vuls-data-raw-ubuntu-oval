		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint messageUse the __string() machinery provided by the tracing subystem to make acopy of the string literals consumed by the \"nested VM-Enter failed\"tracepoint.  A complete copy is necessary to ensure that the tracepointcan't outlive the data/memory it consumes and deference stale memory.Because the tracepoint itself is defined by kvm, if kvm-intel and/orkvm-amd are built as modules, the memory holding the string literalsdefined by the vendor modules will be freed when the module is unloaded,whereas the tracepoint and its data in the ring buffer will live untilkvm is unloaded (or \"indefinitely\" if kvm is built-in).This bug has existed since the tracepoint was added, but was recentlyexposed by a new check in tracing to detect exactly this type of bug.  fmt: '%s%s  ' current_buffer: ' vmx_dirty_log_t-140127  [003] ....kvm_nested_vmenter_failed: '  WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 140134 at kernel/trace/trace.c:3759trace_check_vprintf+0x3be/0x3e0  CPU: 3 PID: 140134 Comm: less Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1-ce2e73ce600a-req#184  Hardware name: ASUS Q87M-E/Q87M-E, BIOS 1102 03/03/2014  RIP: 0010:trace_check_vprintf+0x3be/0x3e0  Code: <0f> 0b 44 8b 4c 24 1c e9 a9 fe ff ff c6 44 02 ff 00 49 8b 97 b0 20  RSP: 0018:ffffa895cc37bcb0 EFLAGS: 00010282  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa895cc37bd08 RCX: 0000000000000027  RDX: 0000000000000027 RSI: 00000000ffffdfff RDI: ffff9766cfad74f8  RBP: ffffffffc0a041d4 R08: ffff9766cfad74f0 R09: ffffa895cc37bad8  R10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffffffffc0a041d4  R13: ffffffffc0f4dba8 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff976409f2c000  FS:  00007f92fa200740(0000) GS:ffff9766cfac0000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000559bd11b0000 CR3: 000000019fbaa002 CR4: 00000000001726e0  Call Trace:   trace_event_printf+0x5e/0x80   trace_raw_output_kvm_nested_vmenter_failed+0x3a/0x60 [kvm]   print_trace_line+0x1dd/0x4e0   s_show+0x45/0x150   seq_read_iter+0x2d5/0x4c0   seq_read+0x106/0x150   vfs_read+0x98/0x180   ksys_read+0x5f/0xe0   do_syscall_64+0x40/0xb0   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae",
