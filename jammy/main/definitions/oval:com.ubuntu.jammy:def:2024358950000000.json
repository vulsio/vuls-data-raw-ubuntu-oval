		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf, sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elemsyzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deleteselements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can beinvoked from any interrupt context, locks taken during a map_delete_elemoperation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversionis possible, as reported by lockdep:       CPU0                    CPU1       ----                    ----  lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);                               local_irq_disable();                               lock(&host->lock);                               lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);  <Interrupt>    lock(&host->lock);Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to bedeleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interruptsenabled, or in softirq context.Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is_not_ hardirq-unsafe, that is interrupts are disabled, and bail out with anerror.Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does notallow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.",
