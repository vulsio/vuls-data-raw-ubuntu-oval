		"Title": "CVE-2020-11080 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-11080` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnghttp2-14 - 1.43.0-1build3\nnghttp2 - 1.43.0-1build3\nnghttp2-client - 1.43.0-1build3\nnghttp2-proxy - 1.43.0-1build3\nnghttp2-server - 1.43.0-1build3\nNo subscription required",
