		"description": "GStreamer AV1 Codec Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote CodeExecution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers toexecute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interactionwith this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attackvectors may vary depending on the implementation.The specific flaw exists within the parsing of AV1 encoded video files. Theissue results from the lack of proper validation of the length ofuser-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the contextof the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22226.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-44429` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-gst-plugins-bad-1.0 - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-opencv - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-bad - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-apps - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-wpe - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.1\nlibgstreamer-opencv1.0-0 - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.1\nlibgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0 - 1.20.3-0ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
