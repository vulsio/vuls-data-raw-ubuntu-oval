    "Title": "CVE-2022-1198 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerabilitity was discovered in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c of linux that allows an attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device using 6pack driver from user space. Duoming Zhou discovered that the 6pack protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1198` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-35-generic - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.15.0-35-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-generic - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-generic-64k - 5.15.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1009.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gke - 5.15.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-ibm - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-kvm - 5.15.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-lowlatency - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1003-oem - 5.17.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1011-raspi - 5.15.0-1011.13\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1011-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1011.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-35-generic - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.15.0-35-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-generic - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-generic-64k - 5.15.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1009.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gke - 5.15.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1001-gkeop - 5.15.0-1001.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1005-ibm - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-kvm - 5.15.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-lowlatency - 5.15.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1003-oem - 5.17.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required",
