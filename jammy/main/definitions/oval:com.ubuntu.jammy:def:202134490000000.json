		"description": "An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiationClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHelloomits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in theinitial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extensionthen a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and adenial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 andrenegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLSclients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions areaffected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
