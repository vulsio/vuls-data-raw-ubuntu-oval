		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1 Recently,handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing: Expectedhandshake_req_destroy_test == req, but handshake_req_destroy_test ==0000000000000000 req == 0000000060f99b40 not ok 11 req_destroy works Thisis because \"sock_release(sock)\" was replaced with \"fput(filp)\" to address amemory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous but fput() usuallydelays the final close and clean-up. The delay is not consequential in theother cases that were changed but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testingthat handshake_req_cancel() followed by closing the file actually does callthe ->hp_destroy method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be surethat the final close is complete before it checks the pointer. We cannotuse a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never called (ie, there isan API bug) then the test will hang. Reported by: Guenter Roeck<linux@roeck-us.net>",
