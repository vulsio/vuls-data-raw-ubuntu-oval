This change was madeby commit ce8ea7cc6eb313 (\"btrfs: don't call btrfs_start_delalloc_rootsin flushoncommit\"). After that change we started producing that warning,and every now and then a user reports this since the warning happens toooften, it spams dmesg/syslog, and a user is unsure if this reflects anyproblem that might compromise the filesystem's reliability.We can not just lock the sb->s_umount semaphore before callingwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that would at least deadlock withfilesystem freezing, since at fs/super.c:freeze_super() sync_filesystem()is called while we are holding that semaphore in write mode, and that cantrigger a transaction commit, resulting in a deadlock. It would alsotrigger the same type of deadlock in the unmount path. Possibly, it couldalso introduce some other locking dependencies that lockdep would report.To fix this call try_to_writeback_inodes_sb() instead ofwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that will try to read lock sb->s_umountand then will only call writeback_inodes_sb() if it was able to lock it.This is fine because the cases where it can't read lock sb->s_umountare during a filesystem unmount or during a filesystem freeze - in thosecases sb->s_umount is write locked and sync_filesystem() is called, whichcalls writeback_inodes_sb(). In other words, in all cases where we can'ttake a read lock on sb->s_umount, writeback is already being triggeredelsewhere.An alternative would be to call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() with anumber of pages different from LONG_MAX, for example matching the numberof delalloc bytes we currently have, in---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48920` to fix the vulnerability.
