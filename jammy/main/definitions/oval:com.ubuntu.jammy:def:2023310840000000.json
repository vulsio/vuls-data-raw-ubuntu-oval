		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c in theLinux kernel 6.2. There is a blocking operation when a task is in!TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible iscalled; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). Indvb_frontend_test_event, down(&fepriv->sem) is called. However,wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, anddown(&fepriv->sem) may block the process.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31084` to fix the vulnerability.
