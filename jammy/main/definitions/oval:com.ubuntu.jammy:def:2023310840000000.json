		"Title": "CVE-2023-31084 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(&fepriv->sem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(&fepriv->sem) may block the process. It was discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking events in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31084` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-aws - 6.2.0-1011.11~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-gcp - 6.2.0-1013.13~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gke - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic-64k - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1039.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-kvm - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1012.12~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1012.12~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia - 5.15.0-1032.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1032.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1037-raspi - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-aws - 6.2.0-1011.11~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-gcp - 6.2.0-1013.13~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gke - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic-64k - 6.2.0-32.32~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1039.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-kvm - 5.15.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1012.12~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1012.12~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia - 5.15.0-1032.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1032.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48\nNo subscription required",
