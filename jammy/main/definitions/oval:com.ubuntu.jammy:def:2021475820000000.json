		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:USB: core: Make do_proc_control() and do_proc_bulk() killableThe USBDEVFS_CONTROL and USBDEVFS_BULK ioctls invokeusb_start_wait_urb(), which contains an uninterruptible wait with auser-specified timeout value.  If timeout value is very large and thedevice being accessed does not respond in a reasonable amount of time,the kernel will complain about \"Task X blocked for more than Nseconds\", as found in testing by syzbot:INFO: task syz-executor.0:8700 blocked for more than 143 seconds.      Not tainted 5.14.0-rc7-syzkaller #0\"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.task:syz-executor.0  state:D stack:23192 pid: 8700 ppid:  8455flags:0x00004004Call Trace: context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:4681 [inline] __schedule+0xc07/0x11f0 kernel/sched/core.c:5938 schedule+0x14b/0x210 kernel/sched/core.c:6017 schedule_timeout+0x98/0x2f0 kernel/time/timer.c:1857 do_wait_for_common+0x2da/0x480 kernel/sched/completion.c:85 __wait_for_common kernel/sched/completion.c:106 [inline] wait_for_common kernel/sched/completion.c:117 [inline] wait_for_completion_timeout+0x46/0x60 kernel/sched/completion.c:157 usb_start_wait_urb+0x167/0x550 drivers/usb/core/message.c:63 do_proc_bulk+0x978/0x1080 drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1236 proc_bulk drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1273 [inline] usbdev_do_ioctl drivers/usb/core/devio.c:2547 [inline] usbdev_ioctl+0x3441/0x6b10 drivers/usb/core/devio.c:2713...To fix this problem, this patch replaces usbfs's calls tousb_control_msg() and usb_bulk_msg() with special-purpose code thatdoes essentially the same thing (as recommended in the comment forusb_start_wait_urb()), except that it always uses a killable wait andit uses GFP_KERNEL rather than GFP_NOIO.",
