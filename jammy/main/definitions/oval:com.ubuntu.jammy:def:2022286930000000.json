Alternative form ofreturn branch target prediction in some Intel(R) Processors may allowan authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure vialocal access..RSBA behavior allows alternate branch predictors to be used bynear RET instructions when the RSB is empty. When eIBRS is enabled,the predicted target of these alternate predictors are restrictedto those belonging to the indirect branch predictor entries of thecurrent prediction domain.",
