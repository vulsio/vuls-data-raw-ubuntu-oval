		"description": "A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not callthe XACE hook when creating the buffer, leaving it unlabeled. When theclient issues another request to access that resource (as with aGetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to access thatbuffer, such as a GC, the XSELINUX code will try to use an object that wasnever labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-0408` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nxnest - 2:21.1.4-2ubuntu1.7~22.04.7\nxorg-server-source - 2:21.1.4-2ubuntu1.7~22.04.7\nxserver-common - 2:21.1.4-2ubuntu1.7~22.04.7\nxserver-xephyr - 2:21.1.4-2ubuntu1.7~22.04.7\nxserver-xorg-core - 2:21.1.4-2ubuntu1.7~22.04.7\nxserver-xorg-legacy - 2:21.1.4-2ubuntu1.7~22.04.7\nxvfb - 2:21.1.4-2ubuntu1.7~22.04.7\nNo subscription required\n\nxwayland - 2:22.1.1-1ubuntu0.10\nNo subscription required",
