		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:IB/ipoib: Fix mcast list lockingReleasing the `priv->lock` while iterating the `priv->multicast_list` in`ipoib_mcast_join_task()` opens a window for `ipoib_mcast_dev_flush()` toremove the items while in the middle of iteration. If the mcast is removedwhile the lock was dropped, the for loop spins forever resulting in a hardlockup (as was reported on RHEL 4.18.0-372.75.1.el8_6 kernel):    Task A (kworker/u72:2 below)       | Task B (kworker/u72:0 below)    -----------------------------------+-----------------------------------    ipoib_mcast_join_task(work)        | ipoib_ib_dev_flush_light(work)      spin_lock_irq(&priv->lock)       | __ipoib_ib_dev_flush(priv, ...)      list_for_each_entry(mcast,       | ipoib_mcast_dev_flush(dev =priv->dev)          &priv->multicast_list, list) |        ipoib_mcast_join(dev, mcast)   |          spin_unlock_irq(&priv->lock) |                                       |   spin_lock_irqsave(&priv->lock,flags)                                       |   list_for_each_entry_safe(mcast,tmcast,                                       |&priv->multicast_list, list)                                       |     list_del(&mcast->list);                                       |     list_add_tail(&mcast->list,&remove_list)                                       |spin_unlock_irqrestore(&priv->lock, flags)          spin_lock_irq(&priv->lock)   |                                       |ipoib_mcast_remove_list(&remove_list)   (Here, `mcast` is no longer on the  |list_for_each_entry_safe(mcast, tmcast,    `priv->multicast_list` and we keep |remove_list, list)    spinning on the `remove_list` of   |  >>>wait_for_completion(&mcast->done)    the other thread which is blocked  |    and the list is still valid on     |    it's stack.)Fix this by keeping the lock held and changing to GFP_ATOMIC to preventeventual sleeps.Unfortunately we could not reproduce the lockup and confirm this fix butbased on the code review I think this fix should address such lockups.crash> bc 31PID: 747      TASK: ff1c6a1a007e8000  CPU: 31   COMMAND: \"kworker/u72:2\"--    [exception RIP: ipoib_mcast_join_task+0x1b1]    RIP: ffffffffc0944ac1  RSP: ff646f199a8c7e00  RFLAGS: 00000002    RAX: 0000000000000000  RBX: ff1c6a1a04dc82f8  RCX: 0000000000000000                                  work (&priv->mcast_task{,.work})    RDX: ff1c6a192d60ac68  RSI: 0000000000000286  RDI: ff1c6a1a04dc8000           &mcast->list    RBP: ff646f199a8c7e90   R8: ff1c699980019420   R9: ff1c6a1920c9a000    R10: ff646f199a8c7e00  R11: ff1c6a191a7d9800  R12: ff1c6a192d60ac00                                                         mcast    R13: ff1c6a1d82200000  R14: ff1c6a1a04dc8000  R15: ff1c6a1a04dc82d8           dev                    priv (&priv->lock)&priv->multicast_list (aka head)    ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff  CS: 0010  SS: 0018--- <NMI exception stack> --- #5 [ff646f199a8c7e00] ipoib_mcast_join_task+0x1b1 at ffffffffc0944ac1[ib_ipoib] #6 [ff646f199a8c7e98] process_one_work+0x1a7 at ffffffff9bf10967crash> rx ff646f199a8c7e68ff646f199a8c7e68:  ff1c6a1a04dc82f8 <<< work = &priv->mcast_task.workcrash> list -hO ipoib_dev_priv.multicast_list ff1c6a1a04dc8000(empty)crash> ipoib_dev_priv.mcast_task.work.func,mcast_mutex.owner.counterff1c6a1a04dc8000  mcast_task.work.func = 0xffffffffc0944910 <ipoib_mcast_join_task>,  mcast_mutex.owner.counter = 0xff1c69998efec000crash> b 8PID: 8        TASK: ff1c69998efec000  CPU: 33   COMMAND: \"kworker/u72:0\"-- #3 [ff646f1980153d50] wait_for_completion+0x96 at ffffffff9c7d7646 #4 [ff646f1980153d90] ipoib_mcast_remove_list+0x56 at ffffffffc0944dc6[ib_ipoib] #5 [ff646f1980153de8] ipoib_mcast_dev_flush+0x1a7 at ffffffffc09455a7[ib_ipoib] #6 [ff646f1980153e58] __ipoib_ib_dev_flush+0x1a4 at ffffffffc09431a4[ib_ipoib] #7 [ff---truncated---",
