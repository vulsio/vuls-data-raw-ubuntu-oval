		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf/x86/lbr: Filter vsyscall addresses We found that a panic can occurwhen a vsyscall is made while LBR sampling is active. If the vsyscall isinterrupted (NMI) for perf sampling, this call sequence can occur (mostrecent at top): __insn_get_emulate_prefix() insn_get_emulate_prefix()insn_get_prefixes() insn_get_opcode() decode_branch_type()get_branch_type() intel_pmu_lbr_filter() intel_pmu_handle_irq()perf_event_nmi_handler() Within __insn_get_emulate_prefix() at frame 0, amacro is called: peek_nbyte_next(insn_byte_t, insn, i) Within this macro,this dereference occurs: (insn)->next_byte Inspecting registers at thispoint, the value of the next_byte field is the address of the vsyscallmade, for example the location of the vsyscall version of gettimeofday() at0xffffffffff600000. The access to an address in the vsyscall region willtrigger an oops due to an unhandled page fault. To fix the bug, filteringfor vsyscalls can be done when determining the branch type. This patch willreturn a \"none\" branch if a kernel address if found to lie in the vsyscallregion.",
