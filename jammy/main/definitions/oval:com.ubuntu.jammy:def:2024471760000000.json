		"title": "CVE-2024-47176 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `cups-browsed`contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to,auto-discovering print services and shared printers. `cups-browsed` bindsto `INADDR_ANY:631`, causing it to trust any packet from any source, andcan cause the `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attackercontrolled URL.Due to the service binding to `*:631 ( INADDR_ANY )`, multiple bugs in`cups-browsed` can be exploited in sequence to introduce a maliciousprinter to the system. This chain of exploits ultimately enables anattacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machinewithout authentication when a print job is started. This poses asignificant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability isparticularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet,potentially exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if theirCUPS services are enabled.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47176` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncups-browsed - 1.28.15-0ubuntu1.3\ncups-filters - 1.28.15-0ubuntu1.3\ncups-filters-core-drivers - 1.28.15-0ubuntu1.3\nlibcupsfilters1 - 1.28.15-0ubuntu1.3\nlibfontembed1 - 1.28.15-0ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
