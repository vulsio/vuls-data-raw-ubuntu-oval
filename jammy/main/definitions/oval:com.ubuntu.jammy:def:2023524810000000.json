		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: arm64:errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load workaround Implementthe workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298. On an affectedCortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed unprivileged load might leakdata from a privileged load via a cache side channel. The issue only existsfor loads within a translation regime with the same translation (e.g. sameASID and VMID). Therefore, the issue only affects the return to EL0. Theworkaround is to execute a TLBI before returning to EL0 after all loads ofprivileged data. A non-shareable TLBI to any address is sufficient. Theworkaround isn't necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) is enabled, butfor simplicity it will be. Page table isolation should normally be disabledfor Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 feature and the E0PD feature (usedwhen KASLR is enabled).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52481` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-starfive - 6.5.0-1007.8~22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
