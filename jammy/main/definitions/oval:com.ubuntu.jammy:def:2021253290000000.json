When using Apache Tomcat10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41, 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 or 7.0.0. to7.0.107 with a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be used,the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494. Note that boththe previously published prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and the previouslypublished mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to this issue.",
