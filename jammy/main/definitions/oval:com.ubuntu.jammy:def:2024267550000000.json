		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: md:Don't suspend the array for interrupted reshape md_start_sync() willsuspend the array if there are spares that can be added or removed fromconf, however, if reshape is still in progress, this won't happen at all ordata will be corrupted(remove_and_add_spares won't be called frommd_choose_sync_action for reshape), hence there is no need to suspend thearray if reshape is not done yet. Meanwhile, there is a potential deadlockfor raid456: 1) reshape is interrupted; 2) set one of the diskWantReplacement, and add a new disk to the array, however, recovery won'tstart until the reshape is finished; 3) then issue an IO across reshpaeposition, this IO will wait for reshape to make progress; 4) continue toreshape, then md_start_sync() found there is a spare disk that can be addedto conf, mddev_suspend() is called; Step 4 and step 3 is waiting for eachother, deadlock triggered. Noted this problem is found by code review, andit's not reporduced yet. Fix this porblem by don't suspend the array forinterrupted reshape, this is safe because conf won't be changed untilreshape is done.",
