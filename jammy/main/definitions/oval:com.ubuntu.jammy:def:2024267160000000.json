		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_stateCurrently, the function update_port_device_state gets the usb_hub fromudev->parent by calling usb_hub_to_struct_hub. However, in case theactconfig or the maxchild is 0, the usb_hub would be NULL and upon furtheraccessing to get port_dev would result in null pointer dereference. Fixthis by introducing an if check after the usb_hub is populated.",
