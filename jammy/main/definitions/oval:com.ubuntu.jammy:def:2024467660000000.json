		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: move netif_queue_set_napi to rtnl-protected sectionsCurrently, netif_queue_set_napi() is called from ice_vsi_rebuild() that isnot rtnl-locked when called from the reset. This creates the need to takethe rtnl_lock just for a single function and complicates thesynchronization with .ndo_bpf. At the same time, there no actual need tofill napi-to-queue information at this exact point.Fill napi-to-queue information when opening the VSI and clear it when theVSI is being closed. Those routines are already rtnl-locked.Also, rewrite napi-to-queue assignment in a way that prevents inclusion ofXDP queues, as this leads to out-of-bounds writes, such as one below.[  +0.000004] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds innetif_queue_set_napi+0x1c2/0x1e0[  +0.000012] Write of size 8 at addr ffff889881727c80 by task bash/7047[  +0.000006] CPU: 24 PID: 7047 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.10.0-rc2+ #2[  +0.000004] Hardware name: Intel Corporation S2600WFT/S2600WFT, BIOSSE5C620.86B.02.01.0014.082620210524 08/26/2021[  +0.000003] Call Trace:[  +0.000003]  <TASK>[  +0.000002]  dump_stack_lvl+0x60/0x80[  +0.000007]  print_report+0xce/0x630[  +0.000007]  ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x10/0x10[  +0.000007]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0x1c9/0x2c0[  +0.000005]  ? netif_queue_set_napi+0x1c2/0x1e0[  +0.000003]  kasan_report+0xe9/0x120[  +0.000004]  ? netif_queue_set_napi+0x1c2/0x1e0[  +0.000004]  netif_queue_set_napi+0x1c2/0x1e0[  +0.000005]  ice_vsi_close+0x161/0x670 [ice][  +0.000114]  ice_dis_vsi+0x22f/0x270 [ice][  +0.000095]  ice_pf_dis_all_vsi.constprop.0+0xae/0x1c0 [ice][  +0.000086]  ice_prepare_for_reset+0x299/0x750 [ice][  +0.000087]  pci_dev_save_and_disable+0x82/0xd0[  +0.000006]  pci_reset_function+0x12d/0x230[  +0.000004]  reset_store+0xa0/0x100[  +0.000006]  ? __pfx_reset_store+0x10/0x10[  +0.000002]  ? __pfx_mutex_lock+0x10/0x10[  +0.000004]  ? __check_object_size+0x4c1/0x640[  +0.000007]  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x30b/0x4a0[  +0.000006]  vfs_write+0x5d6/0xdf0[  +0.000005]  ? fd_install+0x180/0x350[  +0.000005]  ? __pfx_vfs_write+0x10/0xA10[  +0.000004]  ? do_fcntl+0x52c/0xcd0[  +0.000004]  ? kasan_save_track+0x13/0x60[  +0.000003]  ? kasan_save_free_info+0x37/0x60[  +0.000006]  ksys_write+0xfa/0x1d0[  +0.000003]  ? __pfx_ksys_write+0x10/0x10[  +0.000002]  ? __x64_sys_fcntl+0x121/0x180[  +0.000004]  ? _raw_spin_lock+0x87/0xe0[  +0.000005]  do_syscall_64+0x80/0x170[  +0.000007]  ? _raw_spin_lock+0x87/0xe0[  +0.000004]  ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock+0x10/0x10[  +0.000003]  ? file_close_fd_locked+0x167/0x230[  +0.000005]  ? syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x7d/0x220[  +0.000005]  ? do_syscall_64+0x8c/0x170[  +0.000004]  ? do_syscall_64+0x8c/0x170[  +0.000003]  ? do_syscall_64+0x8c/0x170[  +0.000003]  ? fput+0x1a/0x2c0[  +0.000004]  ? filp_close+0x19/0x30[  +0.000004]  ? do_dup2+0x25a/0x4c0[  +0.000004]  ? __x64_sys_dup2+0x6e/0x2e0[  +0.000002]  ? syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x7d/0x220[  +0.000004]  ? do_syscall_64+0x8c/0x170[  +0.000003]  ? __count_memcg_events+0x113/0x380[  +0.000005]  ? handle_mm_fault+0x136/0x820[  +0.000005]  ? do_user_addr_fault+0x444/0xa80[  +0.000004]  ? clear_bhb_loop+0x25/0x80[  +0.000004]  ? clear_bhb_loop+0x25/0x80[  +0.000002]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e[  +0.000005] RIP: 0033:0x7f2033593154\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46766` to fix the vulnerability.
