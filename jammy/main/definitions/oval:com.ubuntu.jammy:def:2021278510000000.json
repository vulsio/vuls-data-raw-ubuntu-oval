		"description": "A security vulnerability that can lead to local privilege escalation hasbeen found in ’guix-daemon’. It affects multi-user setups in which’guix-daemon’ runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivilegeduser spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes itsbuild directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to aroot-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the userpassed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemonchanges ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to theuser. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versionsafter and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior tov1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.",
