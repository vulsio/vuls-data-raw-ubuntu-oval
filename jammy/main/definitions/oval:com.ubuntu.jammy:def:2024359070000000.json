The sequence to reproduce the exception is as follows: a) enablekdump b) trigger kdump via \"echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger\" c) kdump kernelexecutes d) kdump kernel loads mlxbf_gige module e) the mlxbf_gige moduleruns its open() as the the \"oob_net0\" interface is brought up f) mlxbf_gigemodule will experience an exception during its open(), something like:Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address0000000000000000 Mem abort info: ESR = 0x0000000086000004 EC = 0x21: IABT(current EL), IL = 32 bits SET = 0, FnV = 0 EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 FSC = 0x04:level 0 translation fault user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs,pgdp=00000000e29a4000 [0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000,p4d=0000000000000000 Internal error: Oops: 0000000086000004 [#1] SMP CPU: 0PID: 812 Comm: NetworkManager Tainted: G OE 5.15.0-1035-bluefield#37-Ubuntu Hardware name: https://www.mellanox.com BlueField-3 SmartNICMain Card/BlueField-3 SmartNIC Main Card, BIOS 4.6.0.13024 Jan 19 2024pstate: 80400009 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) pc : 0x0 lr: __napi_poll+0x40/0x230 sp : ffff800008003e00 x29: ffff800008003e00 x28:0000000000000000 x27: 00000000ffffffff x26: ffff000066027238 x25:ffff00007cedec00 x24: ffff800008003ec8 x23: 000000000000012c x22:ffff800008003eb7 x21: 0000000000000000 x20: 0000000000000001 x19:ffff000066027238 x18: 0000000000000000 x17: ffff578fcb450000 x16:ffffa870b083c7c0 x15: 0000aaab010441d0 x14: 0000000000000001 x13:00726f7272655f65 x12: 6769675f6662786c x11: 0000000000000000 x10:0000000000000000 x9 : ffffa870b0842398 x8 : 0000000000000004 x7 :fe5a48b9069706ea x6 : 17fdb11fc84ae0d2 x5 : d94a82549d594f35 x4 :0000000000000000 x3 : 0000000000400100 x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 :0000000000000000 x0 : ffff000066027238 Call trace: 0x0net_rx_action+0x178/0x360 __do_softirq+0x15c/0x428 __irq_exit_rcu+0xac/0xecirq_exit+0x18/0x2c handle_domain_irq+0x6c/0xa0 gic_handle_irq+0xec/0x1b0call_on_irq_stack+0x20/0x2c do_interrupt_handler+0x5c/0x70el1_interrupt+0x30/0x50 el1h_64_irq_handler+0x18/0x2c el1h_64_irq+0x7c/0x80__setup_irq+0x4c0/0x950 request_threaded_irq+0xf4/0x1bcmlxbf_gige_request_irqs+0x68/0x110 [mlxbf_gige] mlxbf_gige_open+0x5c/0x170[mlxbf_gige] __dev_open+0x100/0x220 __dev_change_flags+0x16c/0x1f0dev_change_flags+0x2c/0x70 do_setlink+0x220/0xa40__rtnl_newlink+0x56c/0x8a0 rtnl_newlink+0x58/0x84rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x138/0x3c4 netlink_rcv_skb+0x64/0x130rtnetlink_rcv+0x20/0x30 netlink_unicast+0x2ec/0x360netlink_sendmsg+0x278/0x490 __sock_sendmsg+0x5c/0x6c____sys_sendmsg+0x290/0x2d4 ___sys_sendmsg+0x84/0xd0__sys_sendmsg+0x70/0xd0 __arm64_sys_sendmsg+0x2c/0x40invoke_syscall+0x78/0x100 el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x54/0x184do_el0_svc+0x30/0xac el0_svc+0x48/0x160 el0t_64_sync_handler+0xa4/0x12cel0t_64_sync+0x1a4/0x1a8 Code: bad PC value ---[ end trace 7d1c3f3bf9d81885]--- Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops: Fatal exception in interrupt KernelOffset: 0x2870a7a00000 from 0xffff800008000000 PHYS_OFFSET: 0x80000000 CPUfeatures: 0x0,000005c1,a3332a5a Memory Limit: none ---[ end Kernel panic -not syncing: Oops: Fatal exception in interrupt ]--- The exception happensbecause there is a pending RX interrupt before the call to request_irq(RXIRQ) executes.
