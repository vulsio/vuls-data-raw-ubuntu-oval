		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix double free of anonymous device after snapshot creation failure Whencreating a snapshot we may do a double free of an anonymous device in casethere's an error committing the transaction. The second free may result infreeing an anonymous device number that was allocated by some othersubsystem in the kernel or another btrfs filesystem. The steps that lead tothis: 1) At ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we allocate an anonymous devicenumber and assign it to pending_snapshot->anon_dev; 2) Then we callbtrfs_commit_transaction() and end up attransaction.c:create_pending_snapshot(); 3) There we callbtrfs_get_new_fs_root() and pass it the anonymous device number stored inpending_snapshot->anon_dev; 4) btrfs_get_new_fs_root() frees that anonymousdevice number because btrfs_lookup_fs_root() returned a root - someone elsedid a lookup of the new root already, which could some task doing backrefwalking; 5) After that some error happens in the transaction commit path,and at ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we jump to the 'fail' label, and afterthat we free again the same anonymous device number, which in the meanwhilemay have been reallocated somewhere else, becausepending_snapshot->anon_dev still has the same value as in step 1.
