		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:padata: Fix refcnt handling in padata_free_shell()In a high-load arm64 environment, the pcrypt_aead01 test in LTP can leadto system UAF (Use-After-Free) issues. Due to the lengthy analysis ofthe pcrypt_aead01 function call, I'll describe the problem scenariousing a simplified model:Suppose there's a user of padata named `user_function` that adheres tothe padata requirement of calling `padata_free_shell` after `serial()`has been invoked, as demonstrated in the following code:```cstruct request {    struct padata_priv padata;    struct completion *done;};void parallel(struct padata_priv *padata) {    do_something();}void serial(struct padata_priv *padata) {    struct request *request = container_of(padata,    \t\t\t\tstruct request,\t\t\t\tpadata);    complete(request->done);}void user_function() {    DECLARE_COMPLETION(done)    padata->parallel = parallel;    padata->serial = serial;    padata_do_parallel();    wait_for_completion(&done);    padata_free_shell();}```In the corresponding padata.c file, there's the following code:```cstatic void padata_serial_worker(struct work_struct *serial_work) {    ...    cnt = 0;    while (!list_empty(&local_list)) {        ...        padata->serial(padata);        cnt++;    }    local_bh_enable();    if (refcount_sub_and_test(cnt, &pd->refcnt))        padata_free_pd(pd);}```Because of the high system load and the accumulation of unexecutedsoftirq at this moment, `local_bh_enable()` in padata takes longerto execute than usual. Subsequently, when accessing `pd->refcnt`,`pd` has already been released by `padata_free_shell()`, resultingin a UAF issue with `pd->refcnt`.The fix is straightforward: add `refcount_dec_and_test` before calling`padata_free_pd` in `padata_free_shell`.",
