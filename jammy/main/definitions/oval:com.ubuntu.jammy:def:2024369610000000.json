		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal/debugfs: Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debug With thecurrent thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code, user spacecan open the \"mitigations\" file for a thermal zone before the zone'sdebugfs pointer is set which will result in a NULL pointer dereference intze_seq_start(). Moreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called underthe thermal zone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functionsaccessing the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object. Then, it mayclear tz->debugfs after one of those functions has checked it and thestruct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely. To address thefirst problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfsobject to debugfs_create_file() in thermal_debug_tz_add() and maketze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(), tze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show()retrieve it from s->private instead of a pointer to the thermal zoneobject. This will ensure that tz_debugfs will be valid across the\"mitigations\" file accesses until thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called bythermal_debug_tz_remove() removes that file. To address the second problem,use tz->lock in thermal_debug_tz_remove() around the tz->debugfs valuecheck (in case the same thermal zone is removed at the same time in twodifferent threads) and its reset to NULL.
