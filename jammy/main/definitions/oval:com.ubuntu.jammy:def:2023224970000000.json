		"description": "Netdata is an open source option for real-time infrastructure monitoringand troubleshooting. Each Netdata Agent has an automatically generatedMACHINE GUID. It is generated when the agent first starts and it is savedto disk, so that it will persist across restarts and reboots. Anyone whohas access to a Netdata Agent has access to its MACHINE_GUID. Streaming isa feature that allows a Netdata Agent to act as parent for other NetdataAgents (children), offloading children from various functions (increaseddata retention, ML, health monitoring, etc) that can now be handled by theparent Agent. Configuration is done via `stream.conf`. On the parent side,users configure in `stream.conf` an API key (any random UUID can do) toprovide common configuration for all children using this API key and perMACHINE GUID configuration to customize the configuration for each child.The way this was implemented, allowed an attacker to use a validMACHINE_GUID as an API key. This affects all users who expose their NetdataAgents (children) to non-trusted users and they also expose to the sameusers Netdata Agent parents that aggregate data from all these children.The problem has been fixed in: Netdata agent v1.37 (stable) and Netdataagent v1.36.0-409 (nightly). As a workaround, do not enable streaming bydefault. If you have previously enabled this, it can be disabled. Limitingaccess to the port on the recipient Agent to trusted child connections maymitigate the impact of this vulnerability.",
