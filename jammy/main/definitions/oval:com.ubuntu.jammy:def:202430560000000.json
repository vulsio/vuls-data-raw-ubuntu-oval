		"description": "A flaw was found in Podman. This issue may allow an attacker to create aspecially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPCwith at least one other container, can create a large number of IPCresources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaustresources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the maliciouscontainer's cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not.Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removeduntil all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious containeris holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, eitherautomatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasingthe amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restartalways, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in amemory-based denial of service of the system.",
