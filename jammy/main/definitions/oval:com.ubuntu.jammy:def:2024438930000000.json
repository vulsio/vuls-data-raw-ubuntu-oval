		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial: core: check uartclk for zero to avoid divide by zeroCalling ioctl TIOCSSERIAL with an invalid baud_base canresult in uartclk being zero, which will result in adivide by zero error in uart_get_divisor(). The check foruartclk being zero in uart_set_info() needs to be donebefore other settings are made as subsequent calls toioctl TIOCSSERIAL for the same port would be impacted ifthe uartclk check was done where uartclk gets set.Oops: divide error: 0000  PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTIRIP: 0010:uart_get_divisor (drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:580)Call Trace: <TASK>serial8250_get_divisor (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:2576    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:2589)serial8250_do_set_termios (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:502    drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:2741)serial8250_set_termios (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:2862)uart_change_line_settings (./include/linux/spinlock.h:376    ./include/linux/serial_core.h:608 drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:222)uart_port_startup (drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:342)uart_startup (drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:368)uart_set_info (drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:1034)uart_set_info_user (drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:1059)tty_set_serial (drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2637)tty_ioctl (drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2647 drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2791)__x64_sys_ioctl (fs/ioctl.c:52 fs/ioctl.c:907    fs/ioctl.c:893 fs/ioctl.c:893)do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52    (discriminator 1) arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 (discriminator 1))entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)Rule: add",
