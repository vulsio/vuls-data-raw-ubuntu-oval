		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not supported IfSetVariable at runtime is not supported by the firmware we never assign acallback for that function. At the same time mount the efivarfs as RO so noone can call that. However, we never check the permission flags whensomeone remounts the filesystem as RW. As a result this leads to a crashlooking like this: $ mount -o remount,rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars $efi-updatevar -f PK.auth PK [ 303.279166] Unable to handle kernel NULLpointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000 [ 303.280482] Memabort info: [ 303.280854] ESR = 0x0000000086000004 [ 303.281338] EC = 0x21:IABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [ 303.282016] SET = 0, FnV = 0 [303.282414] EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [ 303.282821] FSC = 0x04: level 0 translationfault [ 303.283771] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs,pgdp=000000004258c000 [ 303.284913] [0000000000000000]pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 [ 303.286076] Internal error:Oops: 0000000086000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP [ 303.286936] Modules linked in:qrtr tpm_tis tpm_tis_core crct10dif_ce arm_smccc_trng rng_core drm fuseip_tables x_tables ipv6 [ 303.288586] CPU: 1 PID: 755 Comm: efi-updatevarNot tainted 6.3.0-rc1-00108-gc7d0c4695c68 #1 [ 303.289748] Hardware name:Unknown Unknown Product/Unknown Product, BIOS 2023.04-00627-g88336918701d04/01/2023 [ 303.291150] pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT-SSBS BTYPE=--) [ 303.292123] pc : 0x0 [ 303.292443] lr :efivar_set_variable_locked+0x74/0xec [ 303.293156] sp : ffff800008673c10 [303.293619] x29: ffff800008673c10 x28: ffff0000037e8000 x27:0000000000000000 [ 303.294592] x26: 0000000000000800 x25: ffff000002467400x24: 0000000000000027 [ 303.295572] x23: ffffd49ea9832000 x22:ffff0000020c9800 x21: ffff000002467000 [ 303.296566] x20: 0000000000000001x19: 00000000000007fc x18: 0000000000000000 [ 303.297531] x17:0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 0000aaaac807ab54 [ 303.298495]x14: ed37489f673633c0 x13: 71c45c606de13f80 x12: 47464259e219acf4 [303.299453] x11: ffff000002af7b01 x10: 0000000000000003 x9 :0000000000000002 [ 303.300431] x8 : 0000000000000010 x7 : ffffd49ea8973230x6 : 0000000000a85201 [ 303.301412] x5 : 0000000000000000 x4 :ffff0000020c9800 x3 : 00000000000007fc [ 303.302370] x2 : 0000000000000027x1 : ffff000002467400 x0 : ffff000002467000 [ 303.303341] Call trace: [303.303679] 0x0 [ 303.303938] efivar_entry_set_get_size+0x98/0x16c [303.304585] efivarfs_file_write+0xd0/0x1a4 [ 303.305148]vfs_write+0xc4/0x2e4 [ 303.305601] ksys_write+0x70/0x104 [ 303.306073]__arm64_sys_write+0x1c/0x28 [ 303.306622] invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114 [303.307156] el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x44/0xec [ 303.307803]do_el0_svc+0x38/0x98 [ 303.308268] el0_svc+0x2c/0x84 [ 303.308702]el0t_64_sync_handler+0xf4/0x120 [ 303.309293] el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 [303.309794] Code: ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????
