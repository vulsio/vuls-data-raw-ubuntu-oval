		"Note": "seth-arnold> binutils isn't safe for untrusted inputs. ccdm94> binutils in bionic and earlier does not include commit 422f3d3d. In this commit, function 'find_abstract_instance' was included, and with it, the 'DW_AT_decl_file' case, which is where the memory leak occurs. The patch provided by upstream also fixes function 'scan_unit_for_symbols', which could also cause a memory leak for similar reasons as the other function. Fixing 'find_abstract_instance' in bionic and earlier is not possible as the code being fixed is not present. Fixing 'scan_unit_for_symbols' would only introduce possibly undefined behavior, as the patch frees a variable that in bionic and earlier, is not initialized by 'find_abstract_instance' and is not initialized by the alternative there present, 'find_abstract_instance_name', that doesn't even consider a filename for an argument."
