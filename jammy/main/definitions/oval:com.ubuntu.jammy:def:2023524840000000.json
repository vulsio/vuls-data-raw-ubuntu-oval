Thecommit 06ff87bae8d3 (\"arm64: mm: remove unused functions and variableprotoypes\") fixed a similar lockup on the CPU MMU side. Yet, it can occurto SMMU too, since arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs() is calledtypically next to MMU tlb flush function, e.g. tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly {tlb_flush { __flush_tlb_range { // check MAX_TLBI_OPS } }mmu_notifier_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs { // does not check MAX_TLBI_OPS} } } Clone a CMDQ_MAX_TLBI_OPS from the MAX_TLBI_OPS in tlbflush.h, sincein an SVA case SMMU uses the CPU page table, so it makes sense to alignwith the tlbflush code. Then, replace per-page TLBI commands with a singleper-asid TLBI command, if the request size hits this threshold.",
