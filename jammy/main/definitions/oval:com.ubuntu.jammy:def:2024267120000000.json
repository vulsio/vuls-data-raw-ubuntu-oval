		"title": "CVE-2024-26712 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/kasan: Fix addr error caused by page alignmentIn kasan_init_region, when k_start is not page aligned, at the begin offor loop, k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK is less than k_start, and then`va = block + k_cur - k_start` is less than block, the addr va is invalid,because the memory address space from va to block is not alloced bymemblock_alloc, which will not be reserved by memblock_reserve later, itwill be used by other places.As a result, memory overwriting occurs.for example:int __init __weak kasan_init_region(void *start, size_t size){[...]\t/* if say block(dcd97000) k_start(feef7400) k_end(feeff3fe) */\tblock = memblock_alloc(k_end - k_start, PAGE_SIZE);\t[...]\tfor (k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK; k_cur < k_end; k_cur += PAGE_SIZE) {\t\t/* at the begin of for loop\t\t * block(dcd97000) va(dcd96c00) k_cur(feef7000) k_start(feef7400)\t\t * va(dcd96c00) is less than block(dcd97000), va is invalid\t\t */\t\tvoid *va = block + k_cur - k_start;\t\t[...]\t}[...]}Therefore, page alignment is performed on k_start beforememblock_alloc() to ensure the validity of the VA address.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26712` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-106-generic - 5.15.0-106.116\nlinux-image-5.15.0-106-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-106.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-106-generic - 5.15.0-106.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-106-generic-64k - 5.15.0-106.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1058-kvm - 5.15.0-1058.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1063-azure - 5.15.0-1063.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1063-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1063.72.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1059-gcp - 5.15.0-1059.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1058-gke - 5.15.0-1058.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gkeop - 5.15.0-1044.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1054-ibm - 5.15.0-1054.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-106-lowlatency - 5.15.0-106.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-106-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-106.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1054-nvidia - 5.15.0-1054.55\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1054-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1054.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1059-oracle - 5.15.0-1059.65\nNo subscription required",
