		"title": "CVE-2024-26712 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for NVIDIA BlueField (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/kasan: Fix addr error caused by page alignment Inkasan_init_region, when k_start is not page aligned, at the begin of forloop, k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK is less than k_start, and then `va =block + k_cur - k_start` is less than block, the addr va is invalid,because the memory address space from va to block is not alloced bymemblock_alloc, which will not be reserved by memblock_reserve later, itwill be used by other places. As a result, memory overwriting occurs. forexample: int __init __weak kasan_init_region(void *start, size_t size) {[...] /* if say block(dcd97000) k_start(feef7400) k_end(feeff3fe) */ block= memblock_alloc(k_end - k_start, PAGE_SIZE); [...] for (k_cur = k_start &PAGE_MASK; k_cur < k_end; k_cur += PAGE_SIZE) { /* at the begin of for loop* block(dcd97000) va(dcd96c00) k_cur(feef7000) k_start(feef7400) *va(dcd96c00) is less than block(dcd97000), va is invalid */ void *va =block + k_cur - k_start; [...] } [...] } Therefore, page alignment isperformed on k_start before memblock_alloc() to ensure the validity of theVA address.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26712` to fix the vulnerability.
