		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: riscv:VMAP_STACK overflow detection thread-safe commit 31da94c25aea (\"riscv: addVMAP_STACK overflow detection\") added support for CONFIG_VMAP_STACK. Ifoverflow is detected, CPU switches to `shadow_stack` temporarily beforeswitching finally to per-cpu `overflow_stack`. If two CPUs/harts are racingand end up in over flowing kernel stack, one or both will end up corruptingeach other state because `shadow_stack` is not per-cpu. This patchoptimizes per-cpu overflow stack switch by directly picking per-cpu`overflow_stack` and gets rid of `shadow_stack`. Following are the changesin this patch - Defines an asm macro to obtain per-cpu symbols indestination register. - In entry.S, when overflow is detected, per-cpuoverflow stack is located using per-cpu asm macro. Computing per-cpu symbolrequires a temporary register. x31 is saved away into CSR_SCRATCH(CSR_SCRATCH is anyways zero since we're in kernel). Please see Links foradditional relevant disccussion and alternative solution.
