		"title": "CVE-2021-3761 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "Any CA issuer in the RPKI can trick OctoRPKI prior to 1.3.0 into emittingan invalid VRP \"MaxLength\" value, causing RTR sessions to terminate. Anattacker can use this to disable RPKI Origin Validation in a victim network(for example AS 13335 - Cloudflare) prior to launching a BGP hijack whichduring normal operations would be rejected as \"RPKI invalid\". Additionally,in certain deployments RTR session flapping in and of itself also couldcause BGP routing churn, causing availability issues.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3761` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\noctorpki - 1.4.2-1\nNo subscription required",
