Using refcount on CDC messages brings another problem: whenthe link is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset the QP,which then remove all the pending CQEs related to the QP in the CQ. To makesure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on thesmc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced bysmc_ib_modify_qp_error(). And remove the timeout insmc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we need to wait for all pendingWQEs done, or we may encounter use-after- free when handling CQEs. For IBdevice removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that device beendestroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or the refcount onsmc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be released.",
