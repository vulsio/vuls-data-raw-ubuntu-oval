		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP functionality. This issuecould allow a local user to bypass network filters and gain unauthorizedaccess to some resources. The original patches fixing CVE-2023-1076 areincorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits- a096ccca6e50 (\"tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid\"), -66b2c338adce (\"tap: tap_open(): correctly initialize socket uid\"), pass\"inode->i_uid\" to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and that turnsout to not be accurate.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4194` to fix the vulnerability.
