The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncron - 3.0pl1-134ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",

	"notes": {
		"Note": "jj> This appears to be mitigated by kernel symlink restrictions. The crontabs dir has the sticky bit set drwx-wx--T root crontab crontabs which means symlinks within the dir must have the same uid as the target. It is still possible that a cron package update could trigger this race. seth-arnold> I believe that actually _exploiting_ the bug requires updating the cron package. So long as there's no updates for cron, the vulnerable code doesn't run. So if we find a second bug in cron then we really should fix the race condition at the same time, but so long as we don't push a cron update, the vulnerable code just plain doesn't run. the patch just narrows the time window for the race condition."
