		"Title": "CVE-2023-38430 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.9. ksmbd does not validate the SMB request protocol ID, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SMB request protocol IDs, leading to a out-of- bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38430` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-aws - 6.2.0-1015.15~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1018-gcp - 6.2.0-1018.20~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic-64k - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia - 6.2.0-1011.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia-64k - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-aws - 6.2.0-1015.15~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1018-gcp - 6.2.0-1018.20~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic-64k - 6.2.0-36.37~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1016.16~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia - 6.2.0-1011.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-nvidia-64k - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1019-oem - 6.1.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1009-starfive - 6.2.0-1008.9~22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
