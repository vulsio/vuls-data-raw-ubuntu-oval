		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: SUNRPC:Fix RPC client cleaned up the freed pipefs dentries RPC client pipefsdentries cleanup is in separated rpc_remove_pipedir() workqueue,which takescare about pipefs superblock locking. In some special scenarios, whenkernel frees the pipefs sb of the current client and immediately alloctes anew pipefs sb, rpc_remove_pipedir function would misjudge the existence ofpipefs sb which is not the one it used to hold. As a result, therpc_remove_pipedir would clean the released freed pipefs dentries. To fixthis issue, rpc_remove_pipedir should check whether the current pipefs sbis consistent with the original pipefs sb.
