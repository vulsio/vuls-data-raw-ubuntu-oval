		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: change vm->task_info handlingThis patch changes the handling and lifecycle of vm->task_info object.The major changes are:- vm->task_info is a dynamically allocated ptr now, and its uasge is  reference counted.- introducing two new helper funcs for task_info lifecycle management    - amdgpu_vm_get_task_info: reference counts up task_info before      returning this info    - amdgpu_vm_put_task_info: reference counts down task_info- last put to task_info() frees task_info from the vm.This patch also does logistical changes required for existing usageof vm->task_info.V2: Do not block all the prints when task_info not found (Felix)V3: Fixed review comments from Felix   - Fix wrong indentation   - No debug message for -ENOMEM   - Add NULL check for task_info   - Do not duplicate the debug messages (ti vs no ti)   - Get first reference of task_info in vm_init(), put last     in vm_fini()V4: Fixed review comments from Felix   - fix double reference increment in create_task_info   - change amdgpu_vm_get_task_info_pasid   - additional changes in amdgpu_gem.c while porting",
