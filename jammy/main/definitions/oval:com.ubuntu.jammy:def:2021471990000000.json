		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: CT, Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod actsCT clear action offload adds additional mod hdr actions to theflow's original mod actions in order to clear the registers whichhold ct_state.When such flow also includes encap action, a neigh update eventcan cause the driver to unoffload the flow and then reoffload it.Each time this happens, the ct clear handling adds that same setof mod hdr actions to reset ct_state until the max of mod hdractions is reached.Also the driver never releases the allocated mod hdr actions andcausing a memleak.Fix above two issues by moving CT clear mod acts allocationinto the parsing actions phase and only use it when offloading the rule.The release of mod acts will be done in the normal flow_put(). backtrace:    [<000000007316e2f3>] krealloc+0x83/0xd0    [<00000000ef157de1>] mlx5e_mod_hdr_alloc+0x147/0x300 [mlx5_core]    [<00000000970ce4ae>] mlx5e_tc_match_to_reg_set_and_get_id+0xd7/0x240[mlx5_core]    [<0000000067c5fa17>] mlx5e_tc_match_to_reg_set+0xa/0x20 [mlx5_core]    [<00000000d032eb98>] mlx5_tc_ct_entry_set_registers.isra.0+0x36/0xc0[mlx5_core]    [<00000000fd23b869>] mlx5_tc_ct_flow_offload+0x272/0x1f10 [mlx5_core]    [<000000004fc24acc>] mlx5e_tc_offload_fdb_rules.part.0+0x150/0x620[mlx5_core]    [<00000000dc741c17>] mlx5e_tc_encap_flows_add+0x489/0x690 [mlx5_core]    [<00000000e92e49d7>] mlx5e_rep_update_flows+0x6e4/0x9b0 [mlx5_core]    [<00000000f60f5602>] mlx5e_rep_neigh_update+0x39a/0x5d0 [mlx5_core]",
