		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bcache: avoid oversized read request in cache missing code pathIn the cache missing code path of cached device, if a proper locationfrom the internal B+ tree is matched for a cache miss range, functioncached_dev_cache_miss() will be called in cache_lookup_fn() in thefollowing code block,[code block 1]  526         unsigned int sectors = KEY_INODE(k) == s->iop.inode  527                 ? min_t(uint64_t, INT_MAX,  528                         KEY_START(k) - bio->bi_iter.bi_sector)  529                 : INT_MAX;  530         int ret = s->d->cache_miss(b, s, bio, sectors);Here s->d->cache_miss() is the call backfunction pointer initialized ascached_dev_cache_miss(), the last parameter 'sectors' is an importanthint to calculate the size of read request to backing device of themissing cache data.Current calculation in above code block may generate oversized value of'sectors', which consequently may trigger 2 different potential kernelpanics by BUG() or BUG_ON() as listed below,1) BUG_ON() inside bch_btree_insert_key(),[code block 2]   886         BUG_ON(b->ops->is_extents && !KEY_SIZE(k));2) BUG() inside biovec_slab(),[code block 3]   51         default:   52                 BUG();   53                 return NULL;All the above panics are original from cached_dev_cache_miss() by theoversized parameter 'sectors'.Inside cached_dev_cache_miss(), parameter 'sectors' is used to calculatethe size of data read from backing device for the cache missing. Thissize is stored in s->insert_bio_sectors by the following lines of code,[code block 4]  909    s->insert_bio_sectors = min(sectors, bio_sectors(bio) + reada);Then the actual key inserting to the internal B+ tree is generated andstored in s->iop.replace_key by the following lines of code,[code block 5]  911   s->iop.replace_key = KEY(s->iop.inode,  912                    bio->bi_iter.bi_sector + s->insert_bio_sectors,  913                    s->insert_bio_sectors);The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 1) by BUG_ON() fromthe above code block.And the bio sending to backing device for the missing data is allocatedwith hint from s->insert_bio_sectors by the following lines of code,[code block 6]  926    cache_bio = bio_alloc_bioset(GFP_NOWAIT,  927                 DIV_ROUND_UP(s->insert_bio_sectors, PAGE_SECTORS),  928                 &dc->disk.bio_split);The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 2) by BUG() from theagove code block.Now let me explain how the panics happen with the oversized 'sectors'.In code block 5, replace_key is generated by macro KEY(). From thedefinition of macro KEY(),[code block 7]  71 #define KEY(inode, offset, size)                                  \\  72 ((struct bkey) {                                                  \\  73      .high = (1ULL << 63) | ((__u64) (size) << 20) | (inode),     \\  74      .low = (offset)                                              \\  75 })Here 'size' is 16bits width embedded in 64bits member 'high' of structbkey. But in code block 1, if \"KEY_START(k) - bio->bi_iter.bi_sector\" isvery probably to be larger than (1<<16) - 1, which makes the bkey sizecalculation in code block 5 is overflowed. In one bug report the valueof parameter 'sectors' is 131072 (= 1 << 17), the overflowed 'sectors'results the overflowed s->insert_bio_sectors in code block 4, then makessize field of s->iop.replace_key to be 0 in code block 5. Then the 0-sized s->iop.replace_key is inserted into the internal B+ tree as cachemissing check key (a special key to detect and avoid a racing betweennormal write request and cache missing read request) as,[code block 8]  915   ret = bch_btree_insert_check_key(b, &s->op, &s->iop.replace_key);Then the 0-sized s->iop.replace_key as 3rd parameter triggers the bkeysize check BUG_ON() in code block 2, and causes the kernel panic 1).Another ke---truncated---",
