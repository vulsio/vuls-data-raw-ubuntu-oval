		"description": "yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The patchthat addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec`with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However, thisescaping is not sufficient, and still allows expansion of environmentvariables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along withthis vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11.yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. Itreplaces them with `%%cd:~,%`, a variable that expands to nothing, leavingonly the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using`--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, usingunvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windowsusers who are not able to upgrade, avoid using any output templateexpansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec`is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `\"`, `|` or `&`;and/or instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fieldsfrom it instead.",
