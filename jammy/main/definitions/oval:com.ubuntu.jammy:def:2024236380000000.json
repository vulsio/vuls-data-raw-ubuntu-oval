This bug is fixed bySquid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for thestable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. As a workaround,prevent access to Cache Manager using Squid's main access control:`http_access deny manager`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-23638` to fix the vulnerability.
