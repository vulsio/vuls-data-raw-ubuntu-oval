		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: process: Fix kernel gp leakagechildregs represents the registers which are active for the new threadin user context. For a kernel thread, childregs->gp is never used sincethe kernel gp is not touched by switch_to. For a user mode helper, thegp value can be observed in user space after execve or possibly by othermeans.[From the email thread]The /* Kernel thread */ comment is somewhat inaccurate in that it is alsousedfor user_mode_helper threads, which exec a user process, e.g. /sbin/init orwhen /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is a pipe. Such threads do not havePF_KTHREAD set and are valid targets for ptrace etc. even before they exec.childregs is the *user* context during syscall execution and it isobservablefrom userspace in at least five ways:1. kernel_execve does not currently clear integer registers, so thestarting   register state for PID 1 and other user processes started by the kernelhas   sp = user stack, gp = kernel __global_pointer$, all other integerregisters   zeroed by the memset in the patch comment.   This is a bug in its own right, but I'm unwilling to bet that it is theonly   way to exploit the issue addressed by this patch.2. ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET): you can PTRACE_ATTACH to a user_mode_helperthread   before it execs, but ptrace requires SIGSTOP to be delivered which canonly   happen at user/kernel boundaries.3. /proc/*/task/*/syscall: this is perfectly happy to read pt_regs for   user_mode_helpers before the exec completes, but gp is not one of the   registers it returns.4. PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER: LOCKDOWN_PERF normally prevents access to kernel   addresses via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR, but due to this bug kerneladdresses   are also exposed via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER which is permitted under   LOCKDOWN_PERF. I have not attempted to write exploit code.5. Much of the tracing infrastructure allows access to user registers. Ihave   not attempted to determine which forms of tracing allow access to user   registers without already allowing access to kernel registers.",
