		"title": "CVE-2024-35871 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: riscv:process: Fix kernel gp leakage childregs represents the registers which areactive for the new thread in user context. For a kernel thread,childregs->gp is never used since the kernel gp is not touched byswitch_to. For a user mode helper, the gp value can be observed in userspace after execve or possibly by other means. [From the email thread] The/* Kernel thread */ comment is somewhat inaccurate in that it is also usedfor user_mode_helper threads, which exec a user process, e.g. /sbin/init orwhen /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is a pipe. Such threads do not havePF_KTHREAD set and are valid targets for ptrace etc. even before they exec.childregs is the *user* context during syscall execution and it isobservable from userspace in at least five ways: 1. kernel_execve does notcurrently clear integer registers, so the starting register state for PID 1and other user processes started by the kernel has sp = user stack, gp =kernel __global_pointer$, all other integer registers zeroed by the memsetin the patch comment. This is a bug in its own right, but I'm unwilling tobet that it is the only way to exploit the issue addressed by this patch.2. ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET): you can PTRACE_ATTACH to a user_mode_helperthread before it execs, but ptrace requires SIGSTOP to be delivered whichcan only happen at user/kernel boundaries. 3. /proc/*/task/*/syscall: thisis perfectly happy to read pt_regs for user_mode_helpers before the execcompletes, but gp is not one of the registers it returns. 4.PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER: LOCKDOWN_PERF normally prevents access to kerneladdresses via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR, but due to this bug kernel addressesare also exposed via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER which is permitted underLOCKDOWN_PERF. I have not attempted to write exploit code. 5. Much of thetracing infrastructure allows access to user registers. I have notattempted to determine which forms of tracing allow access to userregisters without already allowing access to kernel registers.",
