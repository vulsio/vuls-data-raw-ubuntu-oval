		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nvmem:Fix shift-out-of-bound (UBSAN) with byte size cells If a cell has 'nbits'equal to a multiple of BITS_PER_BYTE the logic *p &=GENMASK((cell->nbits%BITS_PER_BYTE) - 1, 0); will become undefined behaviorbecause nbits modulo BITS_PER_BYTE is 0, and we subtract one from thatmaking a large number that is then shifted more than the number of bitsthat fit into an unsigned long.
