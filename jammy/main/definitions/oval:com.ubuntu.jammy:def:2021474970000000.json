		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvmem: Fix shift-out-of-bound (UBSAN) with byte size cellsIf a cell has 'nbits' equal to a multiple of BITS_PER_BYTE the logic *p &= GENMASK((cell->nbits%BITS_PER_BYTE) - 1, 0);will become undefined behavior because nbits modulo BITS_PER_BYTE is 0, andwesubtract one from that making a large number that is then shifted more thanthenumber of bits that fit into an unsigned long.UBSAN reports this problem: UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/nvmem/core.c:1386:8 shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'unsigned long' CPU: 6 PID: 7 Comm: kworker/u16:0 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc3+ #9 Hardware name: Google Lazor (rev3+) with KB Backlight (DT) Workqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func Call trace:  dump_backtrace+0x0/0x170  show_stack+0x24/0x30  dump_stack_lvl+0x64/0x7c  dump_stack+0x18/0x38  ubsan_epilogue+0x10/0x54  __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x180/0x194  __nvmem_cell_read+0x1ec/0x21c  nvmem_cell_read+0x58/0x94  nvmem_cell_read_variable_common+0x4c/0xb0  nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u32+0x40/0x100  a6xx_gpu_init+0x170/0x2f4  adreno_bind+0x174/0x284  component_bind_all+0xf0/0x264  msm_drm_bind+0x1d8/0x7a0  try_to_bring_up_master+0x164/0x1ac  __component_add+0xbc/0x13c  component_add+0x20/0x2c  dp_display_probe+0x340/0x384  platform_probe+0xc0/0x100  really_probe+0x110/0x304  __driver_probe_device+0xb8/0x120  driver_probe_device+0x4c/0xfc  __device_attach_driver+0xb0/0x128  bus_for_each_drv+0x90/0xdc  __device_attach+0xc8/0x174  device_initial_probe+0x20/0x2c  bus_probe_device+0x40/0xa4  deferred_probe_work_func+0x7c/0xb8  process_one_work+0x128/0x21c  process_scheduled_works+0x40/0x54  worker_thread+0x1ec/0x2a8  kthread+0x138/0x158  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20Fix it by making sure there are any bits to mask out.",
