		"Title": "CVE-2023-2124 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s XFS file system in how a user restores an XFS image after failure (with a dirty log journal). This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain images. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2124` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1034-oem - 5.17.0-1034.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1035-raspi - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1034-oem - 5.17.0-1034.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1019-oem - 6.0.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1016-oem - 6.1.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required",
