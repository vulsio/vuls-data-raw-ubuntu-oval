		"Title": "CVE-2018-20762 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "GPAC version 0.7.1 and earlier has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the cat_multiple_files function in applications/mp4box/fileimport.c when MP4Box is used for a local directory containing crafted filenames. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-20762` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngpac - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\ngpac-modules-base - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nlibgpac11 - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nNo subscription required",
