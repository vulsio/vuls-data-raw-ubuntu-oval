		"Description": "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started withversion 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host`twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resourcewhich renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTMLand script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploitas being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request impliesthat one is already in a privileged position. This issue was fixed inversion 22.10.0rc1. There are no known workarounds.",
