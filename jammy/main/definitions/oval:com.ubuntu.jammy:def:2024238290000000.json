		"description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio andPython. Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minordifferences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handlingto robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect againstinjection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could triggerexceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of othermalformed input.  Being more lenient than internet standards require could,depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling. Theunhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on theapplication server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability existsdue to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2 fixes thisvulnerability.",
