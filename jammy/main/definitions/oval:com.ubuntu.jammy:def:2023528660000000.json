		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: HID:uclogic: Fix user-memory-access bug inuclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks() When CONFIG_HID_UCLOGIC=y andCONFIG_KUNIT_ALL_TESTS=y, launch kernel and then the belowuser-memory-access bug occurs. Inhid_test_uclogic_params_cleanup_event_hooks(),it calluclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks() with the first arg=NULL, so whenit calls uclogic_params_ugee_v2_has_battery(), the hid_get_drvdata() willaccess hdev->dev with hdev=NULL, which will cause below user-memory-access.So add a fake_device with quirks member and call hid_set_drvdata() toassign hdev->dev->driver_data which avoids the null-ptr-def bug fordrvdata->quirks in uclogic_params_ugee_v2_has_battery(). After applyingthis patch, the below user-memory-access bug never occurs. generalprotection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000329:0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN KASAN: probably user-memory-access in range[0x0000000000001948-0x000000000000194f] CPU: 5 PID: 2189 Comm:kunit_try_catch Tainted: G B W N 6.6.0-rc2+ #30 Hardware name: QEMUStandard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014 RIP:0010:uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks+0x87/0x600 Code: f3 f3 65 488b 14 25 28 00 00 00 48 89 54 24 60 31 d2 48 89 fa c7 44 24 30 00 00 00 0048 c7 44 24 28 02 f8 02 01 48 c1 ea 03 <80> 3c 02 00 0f 85 2c 04 00 00 488b 9d 48 19 00 00 48 b8 00 00 00 RSP: 0000:ffff88810679fc88 EFLAGS:00010202 RAX: dffffc0000000000 RBX: 0000000000000004 RCX: 0000000000000000RDX: 0000000000000329 RSI: ffff88810679fd88 RDI: 0000000000001948 RBP:0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffed1020f639f0 R10:ffff888107b1cf87 R11: 0000000000000400 R12: 1ffff11020cf3f92 R13:ffff88810679fd88 R14: ffff888100b97b08 R15: ffff8881030bb080 FS:0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff888119e80000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS:0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3:0000000005286001 CR4: 0000000000770ee0 DR0: ffffffff8fdd6cf4 DR1:ffffffff8fdd6cf5 DR2: ffffffff8fdd6cf6 DR3: ffffffff8fdd6cf7 DR6:00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000600 PKRU: 55555554 Call Trace: <TASK> ?die_addr+0x3d/0xa0 ? exc_general_protection+0x144/0x220 ?asm_exc_general_protection+0x22/0x30 ?uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks+0x87/0x600 ?sched_clock_cpu+0x69/0x550 ?uclogic_parse_ugee_v2_desc_gen_params+0x70/0x70 ?load_balance+0x2950/0x2950 ? rcu_trc_cmpxchg_need_qs+0x67/0xa0hid_test_uclogic_params_cleanup_event_hooks+0x9e/0x1a0 ?uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks+0x600/0x600 ?__switch_to+0x5cf/0xe60 ? migrate_enable+0x260/0x260 ?__kthread_parkme+0x83/0x150 ? kunit_try_run_case_cleanup+0xe0/0xe0kunit_generic_run_threadfn_adapter+0x4a/0x90 ?kunit_try_catch_throw+0x80/0x80 kthread+0x2b5/0x380 ?kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20 ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x70 ?kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20 ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20 </TASK>Modules linked in: Dumping ftrace buffer: (ftrace buffer empty) ---[ endtrace 0000000000000000 ]--- RIP:0010:uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks+0x87/0x600 Code: f3 f3 65 488b 14 25 28 00 00 00 48 89 54 24 60 31 d2 48 89 fa c7 44 24 30 00 00 00 0048 c7 44 24 28 02 f8 02 01 48 c1 ea 03 <80> 3c 02 00 0f 85 2c 04 00 00 488b 9d 48 19 00 00 48 b8 00 00 00 RSP: 0000:ffff88810679fc88 EFLAGS:00010202 RAX: dffffc0000000000 RBX: 0000000000000004 RCX: 0000000000000000RDX: 0000000000000329 RSI: ffff88810679fd88 RDI: 0000000000001948 RBP:0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffed1020f639f0 R10:ffff888107b1cf87 R11: 0000000000000400 R12: 1ffff11020cf3f92 R13:ffff88810679fd88 R14: ffff888100b97b08 R15: ffff8881030bb080 FS:0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff888119e80000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS:0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3:0000000005286001 CR4: 0000000000770ee0 DR0: ffffffff8fdd6cf4 DR1:---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52866` to fix the vulnerability.
