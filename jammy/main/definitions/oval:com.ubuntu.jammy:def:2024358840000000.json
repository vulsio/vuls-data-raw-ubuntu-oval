		"title": "CVE-2024-35884 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:udp: do not accept non-tunnel GSO skbs landing in a tunnelWhen rx-udp-gro-forwarding is enabled UDP packets might be GROed whenbeing forwarded. If such packets might land in a tunnel this can causevarious issues and udp_gro_receive makes sure this isn't the case bylooking for a matching socket. This is performed inudp4/6_gro_lookup_skb but only in the current netns. This is an issuewith tunneled packets when the endpoint is in another netns. In suchcases the packets will be GROed at the UDP level, which leads to variousissues later on. The same thing can happen with rx-gro-list.We saw this with geneve packets being GROed at the UDP level. In suchcase gso_size is set; later the packet goes through the geneve rx path,the geneve header is pulled, the offset are adjusted and frag_list skbsare not adjusted with regard to geneve. When those skbs hitskb_fragment, it will misbehave. Different outcomes are possibledepending on what the GROed skbs look like; from corrupted packets tokernel crashes.One example is a BUG_ON[1] triggered in skb_segment while processing thefrag_list. Because gso_size is wrong (geneve header was pulled)skb_segment thinks there is \"geneve header size\" of data in frag_list,although it's in fact the next packet. The BUG_ON itself has nothing todo with the issue. This is only one of the potential issues.Looking up for a matching socket in udp_gro_receive is fragile: thelookup could be extended to all netns (not speaking about performances)but nothing prevents those packets from being modified in between and wecould still not find a matching socket. It's OK to keep the currentlogic there as it should cover most cases but we also need to make surewe handle tunnel packets being GROed too early.This is done by extending the checks in udp_unexpected_gso: GSO packetslacking the SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL/_CSUM bits and landing in a tunnel mustbe segmented.[1] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4408!
