		"description": "Transmit requests in Xen's virtual network protocol can consist of multipleparts. While not really useful, except for the initial part any of them maybe of zero length, i.e. carry no data at all. Besides a certain initialportion of the to be transferred data, these parts are directly translatedinto what Linux calls SKB fragments. Such converted request parts can, whenfor a particular SKB they are all of length zero, lead to a de-reference ofNULL in core networking code.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-46838` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1035-oem - 6.1.0-1035.35\nNo subscription required",
