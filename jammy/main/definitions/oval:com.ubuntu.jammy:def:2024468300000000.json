		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Acquire kvm->srcu when handling KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTSGrab kvm->srcu when processing KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS, as KVM will forciblyleave nested VMX/SVM if SMM mode is being toggled, and leaving nested VMXreads guest memory.Note, kvm_vcpu_ioctl_x86_set_vcpu_events() can also be called from KVM_RUNvia sync_regs(), which already holds SRCU.  I.e. trying to precisely usekvm_vcpu_srcu_read_lock() around the problematic SMM code would causeproblems.  Acquiring SRCU isn't all that expensive, so for simplicity,grab it unconditionally for KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS. ============================= WARNING: suspicious RCU usage 6.10.0-rc7-332d2c1d713e-next-vm #552 Not tainted ----------------------------- include/linux/kvm_host.h:1027 suspicious rcu_dereference_check() usage! other info that might help us debug this: rcu_scheduler_active = 2, debug_locks = 1 1 lock held by repro/1071:  #0: ffff88811e424430 (&vcpu->mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at:kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x7d/0x970 [kvm] stack backtrace: CPU: 15 PID: 1071 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.10.0-rc7-332d2c1d713e-next-vm#552 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015 Call Trace:  <TASK>  dump_stack_lvl+0x7f/0x90  lockdep_rcu_suspicious+0x13f/0x1a0  kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_memslot+0x168/0x190 [kvm]  kvm_vcpu_read_guest+0x3e/0x90 [kvm]  nested_vmx_load_msr+0x6b/0x1d0 [kvm_intel]  load_vmcs12_host_state+0x432/0xb40 [kvm_intel]  vmx_leave_nested+0x30/0x40 [kvm_intel]  kvm_vcpu_ioctl_x86_set_vcpu_events+0x15d/0x2b0 [kvm]  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl+0x1107/0x1750 [kvm]  ? mark_held_locks+0x49/0x70  ? kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x7d/0x970 [kvm]  ? kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x497/0x970 [kvm]  kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x497/0x970 [kvm]  ? lock_acquire+0xba/0x2d0  ? find_held_lock+0x2b/0x80  ? do_user_addr_fault+0x40c/0x6f0  ? lock_release+0xb7/0x270  __x64_sys_ioctl+0x82/0xb0  do_syscall_64+0x6c/0x170  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53 RIP: 0033:0x7ff11eb1b539  </TASK>",
