    "Title": "CVE-2022-4269 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action \"mirred\") a local unprivileged user could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition. William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4269` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1014-allwinner - 5.19.0-1014.14~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1021-oem - 6.0.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1035-raspi - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-aws - 5.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-45-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-kvm - 5.15.0-1039.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia - 5.15.0-1030.30\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1030.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.0.0-1021-oem - 6.0.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1009-oem - 6.1.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46\nNo subscription required",
