		"description": "strongSwan versions 5.9.2 through 5.9.5 are affected by authorizationbypass through improper validation of certificate with host mismatch(CWE-297). When certificates are used to authenticate clients inTLS-based EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client isnot enforced to be contained in the client's certificate. So clientscan authenticate with any trusted certificate and claim an arbitraryIKE/EAP identity as their own. This is problematic if the identity isused to make policy decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version5.9.6 in August 2022 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136).",
