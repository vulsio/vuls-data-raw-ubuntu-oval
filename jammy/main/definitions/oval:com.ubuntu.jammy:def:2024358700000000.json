		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: smb:client: fix UAF in smb2_reconnect_server() The UAF bug is due tosmb2_reconnect_server() accessing a session that is already being teareddown by another thread that is executing __cifs_put_smb_ses(). This canhappen when (a) the client has connection to the server but no session or(b) another thread ends up setting @ses->ses_status again to somethingdifferent than SES_EXITING. To fix this, we need to make sure tounconditionally set @ses->ses_status to SES_EXITING and prevent any otherthreads from setting a new status while we're still tearing it down. Thefollowing can be reproduced by adding some delay to right after the ipc isfreed in __cifs_put_smb_ses() - which will give smb2_reconnect_server()worker a chance to run and then accessing @ses->ipc: kinit ... mount.cifs//srv/share /mnt/1 -o sec=krb5,nohandlecache,echo_interval=10 [disconnectsrv] ls /mnt/1 &>/dev/null sleep 30 kdestroy [reconnect srv] sleep 10umount /mnt/1 ...
