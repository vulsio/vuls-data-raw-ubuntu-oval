		"Title": "CVE-2020-15134 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "Faye before version 1.4.0, there is a lack of certification validation inTLS handshakes. Faye uses em-http-request and faye-websocket in the Rubyversion of its client. Those libraries both use the`EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLShandshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This methoddoes not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that itdoes not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificatefor the expected hostname. That means that any `https:` or `wss:`connection made using these libraries is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middleattack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server it isconnected to. The first request a Faye client makes is always sent vianormal HTTP, but later messages may be sent via WebSocket. Therefore it isvulnerable to the same problem that these underlying libraries are, and weneeded both libraries to support TLS verification before Faye could claimto do the same. Your client would still be insecure if its initial HTTPSrequest was verified, but later WebSocket connections were not. This isfixed in Faye v1.4.0, which enables verification by default.
