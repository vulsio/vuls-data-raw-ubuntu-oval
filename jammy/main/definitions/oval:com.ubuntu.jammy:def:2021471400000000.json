		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/amd: Clear DMA ops when switching domain Since commit 08a27c1c3ecf(\"iommu: Add support to change default domain of an iommu group\") a usercan switch a device between IOMMU and direct DMA through sysfs. Thisdoesn't work for AMD IOMMU at the moment because dev->dma_ops is notcleared when switching from a DMA to an identity IOMMU domain. The DMAlayer thus attempts to use the dma-iommu ops on an identity domain, causingan oops: # echo 0000:00:05.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/unbind #echo identity > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:05.0/iommu_group/type # echo0000:00:05.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/bind ... BUG: kernel NULLpointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028 ... Call Trace:iommu_dma_alloc e1000e_setup_tx_resources e1000e_open Sinceiommu_change_dev_def_domain() calls probe_finalize() again, clear thedma_ops there like Vt-d does.",
