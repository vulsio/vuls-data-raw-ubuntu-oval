Here is anotherdifferent caller causing the same issue because of the same reason. Sowe should protect it with sk_callback_lock read lock because the writerside in the sk_psock_drop() uses \"write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);\".To avoid errors that could happen in future, I move those two pairs oflock into the sk_psock_data_ready(), which is suggested by John Fastabend.",
