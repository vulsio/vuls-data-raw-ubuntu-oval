Here is another different caller causingthe same issue because of the same reason. So we should protect it withsk_callback_lock read lock because the writer side in the sk_psock_drop()uses \"write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);\". To avoid errors that couldhappen in future, I move those two pairs of lock into thesk_psock_data_ready(), which is suggested by John Fastabend.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36938` to fix the vulnerability.
