		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mt76: mt7921e: fix crash in chip reset failIn case of drv own fail in reset, we may need to run mac_reset severaltimes. The sequence would trigger system crash as the log below.Because we do not re-enable/schedule \"tx_napi\" before disable it again,the process would keep waiting for state change in napi_diable(). Toavoid the problem and keep status synchronize for each run, goto finalresource handling if drv own failed.[ 5857.353423] mt7921e 0000:3b:00.0: driver own failed[ 5858.433427] mt7921e 0000:3b:00.0: Timeout for driver own[ 5859.633430] mt7921e 0000:3b:00.0: driver own failed[ 5859.633444] ------------[ cut here ]------------[ 5859.633446] WARNING: CPU: 6 at kernel/kthread.c:659 kthread_park+0x11d[ 5859.633717] Workqueue: mt76 mt7921_mac_reset_work [mt7921_common][ 5859.633728] RIP: 0010:kthread_park+0x11d/0x150[ 5859.633736] RSP: 0018:ffff8881b676fc68 EFLAGS: 00010202......[ 5859.633766] Call Trace:[ 5859.633768]  <TASK>[ 5859.633771]  mt7921e_mac_reset+0x176/0x6f0 [mt7921e][ 5859.633778]  mt7921_mac_reset_work+0x184/0x3a0 [mt7921_common][ 5859.633785]  ? mt7921_mac_set_timing+0x520/0x520 [mt7921_common][ 5859.633794]  ? __kasan_check_read+0x11/0x20[ 5859.633802]  process_one_work+0x7ee/0x1320[ 5859.633810]  worker_thread+0x53c/0x1240[ 5859.633818]  kthread+0x2b8/0x370[ 5859.633824]  ? process_one_work+0x1320/0x1320[ 5859.633828]  ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x30/0x30[ 5859.633834]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30[ 5859.633842]  </TASK>",
