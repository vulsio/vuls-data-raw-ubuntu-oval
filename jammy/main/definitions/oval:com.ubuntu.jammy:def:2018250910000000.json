		"Title": "CVE-2018-25091 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-25091` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-pip - 22.0.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.4\npython3-pip-whl - 22.0.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.4\nNo subscription required",
