		"title": "CVE-2023-46813 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable bylocal users with userspace access to MMIO registers. Incorrect accesschecking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the SEV-ESemulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access to kernelmemory (and thus privilege escalation). This depends on a race conditionthrough which userspace can replace an instruction before the #VC handlerreads it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-46813` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-94-generic - 5.15.0-94.104\nlinux-image-5.15.0-94-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-94.104\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-94-generic - 5.15.0-94.104\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-94-generic-64k - 5.15.0-94.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-kvm - 5.15.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1053-aws - 5.15.0-1053.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1056-azure - 5.15.0-1056.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1056-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1056.64.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-gcp - 5.15.0-1051.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-gke - 5.15.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gkeop - 5.15.0-1036.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-ibm - 5.15.0-1046.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1047.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-94-lowlatency - 5.15.0-94.104\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-94-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-94.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-nvidia - 5.15.0-1044.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1044.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-oracle - 5.15.0-1051.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1027-oem - 6.1.0-1027.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1046-raspi - 5.15.0-1046.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1027-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.15.0-1027.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1014-oem - 6.5.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-17-generic - 6.5.0-17.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-generic - 6.5.0-17.17~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-generic-64k - 6.5.0-17.17~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-lowlatency - 6.5.0-17.17.1.1.1~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-17.17.1.1.1~22.04.1\nNo subscription required",
