		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nsh: Restore skb->{protocol,data,mac_header} for outer header innsh_gso_segment().syzbot triggered various splats (see [0] and links) by a crafted GSOpacket of VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP layering the following protocols:  ETH_P_8021AD + ETH_P_NSH + ETH_P_IPV6 + IPPROTO_UDPNSH can encapsulate IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, NSH, and MPLS.  As the innerprotocol can be Ethernet, NSH GSO handler, nsh_gso_segment(), callsskb_mac_gso_segment() to invoke inner protocol GSO handlers.nsh_gso_segment() does the following for the original skb beforecalling skb_mac_gso_segment()  1. reset skb->network_header  2. save the original skb->{mac_heaeder,mac_len} in a local variable  3. pull the NSH header  4. resets skb->mac_header  5. set up skb->mac_len and skb->protocol for the inner protocol.and does the following for the segmented skb  6. set ntohs(ETH_P_NSH) to skb->protocol  7. push the NSH header  8. restore skb->mac_header  9. set skb->mac_header + mac_len to skb->network_header 10. restore skb->mac_lenThere are two problems in 6-7 and 8-9.  (a)  After 6 & 7, skb->data points to the NSH header, so the outer header  (ETH_P_8021AD in this case) is stripped when skb is sent out of netdev.  Also, if NSH is encapsulated by NSH + Ethernet (so NSH-Ethernet-NSH),  skb_pull() in the first nsh_gso_segment() will make skb->data point  to the middle of the outer NSH or Ethernet header because the Ethernet  header is not pulled by the second nsh_gso_segment().  (b)  While restoring skb->{mac_header,network_header} in 8 & 9,  nsh_gso_segment() does not assume that the data in the linear  buffer is shifted.  However, udp6_ufo_fragment() could shift the data and change  skb->mac_header accordingly as demonstrated by syzbot.  If this happens, even the restored skb->mac_header points to  the middle of the outer header.It seems nsh_gso_segment() has never worked with outer headers so far.At the end of nsh_gso_segment(), the outer header must be restored forthe segmented skb, instead of the NSH header.To do that, let's calculate the outer header position relatively fromthe inner header and set skb->{data,mac_header,protocol} properly.[0]:BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_process_outbounddrivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:524 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l3drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:602 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_queue_xmit+0xf44/0x16b0drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:668 ipvlan_process_outbound drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:524 [inline] ipvlan_xmit_mode_l3 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:602 [inline] ipvlan_queue_xmit+0xf44/0x16b0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:668 ipvlan_start_xmit+0x5c/0x1a0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_main.c:222 __netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:4989 [inline] netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:5003 [inline] xmit_one net/core/dev.c:3547 [inline] dev_hard_start_xmit+0x244/0xa10 net/core/dev.c:3563 __dev_queue_xmit+0x33ed/0x51c0 net/core/dev.c:4351 dev_queue_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:3171 [inline] packet_xmit+0x9c/0x6b0 net/packet/af_packet.c:276 packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3081 [inline] packet_sendmsg+0x8aef/0x9f10 net/packet/af_packet.c:3113 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:745 [inline] __sys_sendto+0x735/0xa10 net/socket.c:2191 __do_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2203 [inline] __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2199 [inline] __x64_sys_sendto+0x125/0x1c0 net/socket.c:2199 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xcf/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6bUninit was created at: slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:3819 [inline] slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:3860 [inline] __do_kmalloc_node mm/slub.c:3980 [inline] __kmalloc_node_track_caller+0x705/0x1000 mm/slub.c:4001 kmalloc_reserve+0x249/0x4a0 net/core/skbuff.c:582 __---truncated---",
