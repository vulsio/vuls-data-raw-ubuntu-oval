		"Description": "Symfony/Http-Kernel is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHPframework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHPcomponents. Headers that are not part of the \"trusted_headers\" allowed listare ignored and protect users from \"Cache poisoning\" attacks. In Symfony5.2, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, butthis header was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was not part of the\"trusted_headers\" allowed list. An attacker could leverage this opportunityto forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, leading to aweb cache poisoning issue. Versions 5.3.12 and later have a patch to ensurethat the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is not forwarded to subrequests whenit is not trusted.",
