		"title": "CVE-2021-47406 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:add error checking to ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks() If the call toext4_map_blocks() fails due to an corrupted file system,ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks() can get stuck in an infinite loop. This couldbe reproduced by running generic/526 with a file system that hasinline_data and fast_commit enabled. The system will repeatedly log to theconsole: EXT4-fs warning (device dm-3): ext4_block_to_path:105: block1074800922 > max in inode 131076 and the stack that it gets stuck in is:ext4_block_to_path+0xe3/0x130 ext4_ind_map_blocks+0x93/0x690ext4_map_blocks+0x100/0x660 skip_hole+0x47/0x70ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks+0x223/0x440 ext4_fc_replay_inode+0x29e/0x3b0ext4_fc_replay+0x278/0x550 do_one_pass+0x646/0xc10jbd2_journal_recover+0x14a/0x270 jbd2_journal_load+0xc4/0x150ext4_load_journal+0x1f3/0x490 ext4_fill_super+0x22d4/0x2c00 With thispatch, generic/526 still fails, but system is no longer locking up in atight loop. It's likely the root casue is that fast_commit replay iscorrupting file systems with inline_data, and we probably need to addbetter error handling in the fast commit replay code path beyond what isdone here, which essentially just breaks the infinite loop withoutreporting the to the higher levels of the code.",
