		"description": "When an application tells libcurl it wants to allow HTTP/2 server push, andthe amount of received headers for the push surpasses the maximum allowedlimit (1000), libcurl aborts the server push. When aborting, libcurlinadvertently does not free all the previously allocated headers andinstead leaks the memory. Further, this error condition fails silently andis therefore not easily detected by an application.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-2398` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.16\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.16\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.16\nlibcurl4 - 7.81.0-1ubuntu1.16\nNo subscription required",
