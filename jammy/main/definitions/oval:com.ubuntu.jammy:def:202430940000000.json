		"description": "Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, startingwith version 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzmabuild process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test fileexisting in the source code, which is then used to modify specificfunctions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma librarythat can be used by any software linked against this library, interceptingand modifying the data interaction with this library.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-3094` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblzma5 - 5.2.5-2ubuntu1\nxz-utils - 5.2.5-2ubuntu1\nxzdec - 5.2.5-2ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
