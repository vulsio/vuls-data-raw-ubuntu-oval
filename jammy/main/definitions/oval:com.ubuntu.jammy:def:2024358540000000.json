		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during rehashThe rehash delayed work migrates filters from one region to anotheraccording to the number of available credits.The migrated from region is destroyed at the end of the work if thenumber of credits is non-negative as the assumption is that this isindicative of migration being complete. This assumption is incorrect asa non-negative number of credits can also be the result of a failedmigration.The destruction of a region that still has filters referencing it canresult in a use-after-free [1].Fix by not destroying the region if migration failed.[1]BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free inmlxsw_sp_acl_ctcam_region_entry_remove+0x21d/0x230Read of size 8 at addr ffff8881735319e8 by task kworker/0:31/3858CPU: 0 PID: 3858 Comm: kworker/0:31 Tainted: G        W6.9.0-rc2-custom-00782-gf2275c2157d8 #5Hardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
