		"title": "CVE-2022-48734 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix deadlock between quota disable and qgroup rescan worker Quota disableioctl starts a transaction before waiting for the qgroup rescan workercompletes. However, this wait can be infinite and results in deadlockbecause of circular dependency among the quota disable ioctl, the qgrouprescan worker and the other task with transaction such as block grouprelocation task. The deadlock happens with the steps following: 1) Task Acalls ioctl to disable quota. It starts a transaction and waits for qgrouprescan worker completes. 2) Task B such as block group relocation taskstarts a transaction and joins to the transaction that task A started. Thentask B commits to the transaction. In this commit, task B waits for acommit by task A. 3) Task C as the qgroup rescan worker starts its job andstarts a transaction. In this transaction start, task C waits forcompletion of the transaction that task A started and task B committed.This deadlock was found with fstests test case btrfs/115 and a zonednull_blk device. The test case enables and disables quota, and the blockgroup reclaim was triggered during the quota disable by chance. Thedeadlock was also observed by running quota enable and disable in parallelwith 'btrfs balance' command on regular null_blk devices. An example reportof the deadlock: [372.469894] INFO: task kworker/u16:6:103 blocked for morethan 122 seconds.
