    "Title": "CVE-2022-21499 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - high.",
    "Description": "KGDB and KDB allow read and write access to kernel memory, and thus should be restricted during lockdown. An attacker with access to a serial port could trigger the debugger so it is important that the debugger respect the lockdown mode when/if it is triggered. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 6.7 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to the kernel debugger when booted in secure boot environments. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-21499` to fix the vulnerability.
