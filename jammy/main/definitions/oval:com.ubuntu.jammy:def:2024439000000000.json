		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: xc2028: avoid use-after-free in load_firmware_cb()syzkaller reported use-after-free in load_firmware_cb() [1].The reason is because the module allocated a struct tuner in tuner_probe(),and then the module initialization failed, the struct tuner was released.A worker which created during module initialization accesses this structtuner later, it caused use-after-free.The process is as follows:task-6504           worker_threadtuner_probe                             <= alloc dvb_frontend [2]...request_firmware_nowait                 <= create a worker...tuner_remove                            <= free dvb_frontend...                    request_firmware_work_func  <= the firmware is ready                    load_firmware_cb    <= but now the dvb_frontend hasbeen freedTo fix the issue, check the dvd_frontend in load_firmware_cb(), if it isnull, report a warning and just return.[1]:    ==================================================================     BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in load_firmware_cb+0x1310/0x17a0     Read of size 8 at addr ffff8000d7ca2308 by task kworker/2:3/6504     Call trace:      load_firmware_cb+0x1310/0x17a0      request_firmware_work_func+0x128/0x220      process_one_work+0x770/0x1824      worker_thread+0x488/0xea0      kthread+0x300/0x430      ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20     Allocated by task 6504:      kzalloc      tuner_probe+0xb0/0x1430      i2c_device_probe+0x92c/0xaf0      really_probe+0x678/0xcd0      driver_probe_device+0x280/0x370      __device_attach_driver+0x220/0x330      bus_for_each_drv+0x134/0x1c0      __device_attach+0x1f4/0x410      device_initial_probe+0x20/0x30      bus_probe_device+0x184/0x200      device_add+0x924/0x12c0      device_register+0x24/0x30      i2c_new_device+0x4e0/0xc44      v4l2_i2c_new_subdev_board+0xbc/0x290      v4l2_i2c_new_subdev+0xc8/0x104      em28xx_v4l2_init+0x1dd0/0x3770     Freed by task 6504:      kfree+0x238/0x4e4      tuner_remove+0x144/0x1c0      i2c_device_remove+0xc8/0x290      __device_release_driver+0x314/0x5fc      device_release_driver+0x30/0x44      bus_remove_device+0x244/0x490      device_del+0x350/0x900      device_unregister+0x28/0xd0      i2c_unregister_device+0x174/0x1d0      v4l2_device_unregister+0x224/0x380      em28xx_v4l2_init+0x1d90/0x3770     The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff8000d7ca2000      which belongs to the cache kmalloc-2k of size 2048     The buggy address is located 776 bytes inside of      2048-byte region [ffff8000d7ca2000, ffff8000d7ca2800)     The buggy address belongs to the page:     page:ffff7fe00035f280 count:1 mapcount:0 mapping:ffff8000c001f000index:0x0     flags: 0x7ff800000000100(slab)     raw: 07ff800000000100 ffff7fe00049d880 0000000300000003ffff8000c001f000     raw: 0000000000000000 0000000080100010 00000001ffffffff0000000000000000     page dumped because: kasan: bad access detected     Memory state around the buggy address:      ffff8000d7ca2200: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb      ffff8000d7ca2280: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb     >ffff8000d7ca2300: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb                           ^      ffff8000d7ca2380: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb      ffff8000d7ca2400: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb     ==================================================================[2]    Actually, it is allocated for struct tuner, and dvb_frontend is inside.",
