		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ethernet:enic: Fix a use after free bug in enic_hard_start_xmitIn enic_hard_start_xmit, it calls enic_queue_wq_skb(). Insideenic_queue_wq_skb, if some error happens, the skb will be freedby dev_kfree_skb(skb). But the freed skb is still used inskb_tx_timestamp(skb).My patch makes enic_queue_wq_skb() return error and goto spin_unlock()incase of error. The solution is provided by Govind.See https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/30/961.",
