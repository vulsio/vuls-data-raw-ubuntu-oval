		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:skbuff: add overflow debug check to pull/push helpers syzbot managed totrigger following splat: BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in__skb_flow_dissect+0x4a3b/0x5e50 Read of size 1 at addr ffff888208a4000e bytask a.out/2313 [..] __skb_flow_dissect+0x4a3b/0x5e50__skb_get_hash+0xb4/0x400 ip_tunnel_xmit+0x77e/0x26f0ipip_tunnel_xmit+0x298/0x410 .. Analysis shows that the skb has a valid->head, but bogus ->data pointer. skb->data gets its bogus value via theneigh layer, which does: 1556 __skb_pull(skb, skb_network_offset(skb)); ...and the skb was already dodgy at this point: skb_network_offset(skb)returns a negative value due to an earlier overflow of skb->network_header(u16). __skb_pull thus \"adjusts\" skb->data by a huge offset, pointingoutside skb->head area. Allow debug builds to splat when we try topull/push more than INT_MAX bytes. After this, the syzkaller reproduceryields a more precise splat before the flow dissector attempts to read offskb->data memory: WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 2313 at include/linux/skbuff.h:2653neigh_connected_output+0x28e/0x400 ip_finish_output2+0xb25/0xed0iptunnel_xmit+0x4ff/0x870 ipgre_xmit+0x78e/0xbb0",
