		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: restore set elements when delete set fails From abortpath, nft_mapelem_activate() needs to restore refcounters to the originalstate. Currently, it uses the set->ops->walk() to iterate over these setelements. The existing set iterator skips inactive elements in the nextgeneration, this does not work from the abort path to restore the originalstate since it has to skip active elements instead (not inactive ones).This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iteratorcallback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which needs toskip active elements. Toggle next generation bit for elements when deleteset command is invoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path torestore the next generation bit.
