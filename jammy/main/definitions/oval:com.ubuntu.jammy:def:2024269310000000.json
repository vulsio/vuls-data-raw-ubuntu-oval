Thefailure to flush causes upper layer to start modifying scsi_cmnd. When thesystem frees up some memory, the subsequent cable pull trigger anothercommand flush. At this point the driver access a null pointer whenattempting to DMA unmap the SGL. Add a check to make sure commands areflush back on session tear down to prevent the null pointer access.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26931` to fix the vulnerability.
