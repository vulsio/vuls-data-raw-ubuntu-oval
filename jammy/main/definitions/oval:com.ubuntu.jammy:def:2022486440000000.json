		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: taprio: avoid disabling offload when it was never enabled In anincredibly strange API design decision, qdisc->destroy() gets called evenif qdisc->init() never succeeded, not exclusively since commit 87b60cfacf9f(\"net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation\"), but apparently alsoearlier (in the case of qdisc_create_dflt()). The taprio qdisc does notfully acknowledge this when it attempts full offload, because it starts offwith q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID in taprio_init(), then it replacesq->flags with TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_FLAGS parsed from netlink (intaprio_change(), tail called from taprio_init()). But in taprio_destroy(),we call taprio_disable_offload(), and this determines what to do based onFULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED(q->flags). But looking at the implementation ofFULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() (a bitwise check of bit 1 in q->flags), it isinvalid to call this macro on q->flags when it containsTAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, because that is set to U32_MAX, and thereforeFULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() will return true on an invalid set of flags. As aresult, it is possible to crash the kernel if user space forces an errorbetween setting q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, and the calling oftaprio_enable_offload(). This is because drivers do not expect the offloadto be disabled when it was never enabled. The error that we force here isto attach taprio as a non-root qdisc, but instead as child of an mqprioroot qdisc: $ tc qdisc add dev swp0 root handle 1: \\ mqprio num_tc 8 map 01 2 3 4 5 6 7 \\ queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 hw 0 $ tc qdiscreplace dev swp0 parent 1:1 \\ taprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \\ queues1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 base-time 0 \\ sched-entry S 0x7f 990000sched-entry S 0x80 100000 \\ flags 0x0 clockid CLOCK_TAI Unable to handlekernel paging request at virtual address fffffffffffffff8[fffffffffffffff8] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 Internalerror: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP Call trace: taprio_dump+0x27c/0x310vsc9959_port_setup_tc+0x1f4/0x460 felix_port_setup_tc+0x24/0x3cdsa_slave_setup_tc+0x54/0x27c taprio_disable_offload.isra.0+0x58/0xe0taprio_destroy+0x80/0x104 qdisc_create+0x240/0x470tc_modify_qdisc+0x1fc/0x6b0 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x12c/0x390netlink_rcv_skb+0x5c/0x130 rtnetlink_rcv+0x1c/0x2c Fix this by keepingtrack of the operations we made, and undo the offload only if we actuallydid it.
