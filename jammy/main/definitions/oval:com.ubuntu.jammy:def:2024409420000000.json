		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mac80211: mesh: Fix leak of mesh_preq_queue objectsThe hwmp code use objects of type mesh_preq_queue, added to a list inieee80211_if_mesh, to keep track of mpath we need to resolve. If the mpathgets deleted, ex mesh interface is removed, the entries in that list willnever get cleaned. Fix this by flushing all corresponding items of thepreq_queue in mesh_path_flush_pending().This should take care of KASAN reports like this:unreferenced object 0xffff00000668d800 (size 128):  comm \"kworker/u8:4\", pid 67, jiffies 4295419552 (age 1836.444s)  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    00 1f 05 09 00 00 ff ff 00 d5 68 06 00 00 ff ff  ..........h.....    8e 97 ea eb 3e b8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ....>...........  backtrace:    [<000000007302a0b6>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e0/0x35c    [<00000000049bd418>] kmalloc_trace+0x34/0x80    [<0000000000d792bb>] mesh_queue_preq+0x44/0x2a8    [<00000000c99c3696>] mesh_nexthop_resolve+0x198/0x19c    [<00000000926bf598>] ieee80211_xmit+0x1d0/0x1f4    [<00000000fc8c2284>] __ieee80211_subif_start_xmit+0x30c/0x764    [<000000005926ee38>] ieee80211_subif_start_xmit+0x9c/0x7a4    [<000000004c86e916>] dev_hard_start_xmit+0x174/0x440    [<0000000023495647>] __dev_queue_xmit+0xe24/0x111c    [<00000000cfe9ca78>] batadv_send_skb_packet+0x180/0x1e4    [<000000007bacc5d5>] batadv_v_elp_periodic_work+0x2f4/0x508    [<00000000adc3cd94>] process_one_work+0x4b8/0xa1c    [<00000000b36425d1>] worker_thread+0x9c/0x634    [<0000000005852dd5>] kthread+0x1bc/0x1c4    [<000000005fccd770>] ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20unreferenced object 0xffff000009051f00 (size 128):  comm \"kworker/u8:4\", pid 67, jiffies 4295419553 (age 1836.440s)  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    90 d6 92 0d 00 00 ff ff 00 d8 68 06 00 00 ff ff  ..........h.....    36 27 92 e4 02 e0 01 00 00 58 79 06 00 00 ff ff  6'.......Xy.....  backtrace:    [<000000007302a0b6>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e0/0x35c    [<00000000049bd418>] kmalloc_trace+0x34/0x80    [<0000000000d792bb>] mesh_queue_preq+0x44/0x2a8    [<00000000c99c3696>] mesh_nexthop_resolve+0x198/0x19c    [<00000000926bf598>] ieee80211_xmit+0x1d0/0x1f4    [<00000000fc8c2284>] __ieee80211_subif_start_xmit+0x30c/0x764    [<000000005926ee38>] ieee80211_subif_start_xmit+0x9c/0x7a4    [<000000004c86e916>] dev_hard_start_xmit+0x174/0x440    [<0000000023495647>] __dev_queue_xmit+0xe24/0x111c    [<00000000cfe9ca78>] batadv_send_skb_packet+0x180/0x1e4    [<000000007bacc5d5>] batadv_v_elp_periodic_work+0x2f4/0x508    [<00000000adc3cd94>] process_one_work+0x4b8/0xa1c    [<00000000b36425d1>] worker_thread+0x9c/0x634    [<0000000005852dd5>] kthread+0x1bc/0x1c4    [<000000005fccd770>] ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20",
