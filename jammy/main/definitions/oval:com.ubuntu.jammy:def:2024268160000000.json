		"title": "CVE-2024-26816 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86,relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes section When building withCONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into the .notes section so thatXen can find the \"startup_xen\" entry point. This information is used priorto booting the kernel, so relocations are not useful. In fact, performingrelocations against the .notes section means that the KASLR base is exposedsince /sys/kernel/notes is world-readable. To avoid leaking the KASLR basewithout breaking unprivileged tools that are expecting to read/sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations in the .notes section. Thevalues readable in .notes are then identical to those found in System.map.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26816` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-112-generic - 5.15.0-112.122\nlinux-image-5.15.0-112-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-112.122\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-112-generic - 5.15.0-112.122\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-112-generic-64k - 5.15.0-112.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1060-kvm - 5.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1063-aws - 5.15.0-1063.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1062-gcp - 5.15.0-1062.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1060-gke - 5.15.0-1060.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-gkeop - 5.15.0-1046.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1056-ibm - 5.15.0-1056.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1058-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1058.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-110-lowlatency - 5.15.0-110.120\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-110-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-110.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1058-nvidia - 5.15.0-1058.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1058-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1058.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1061-oracle - 5.15.0-1061.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1030-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.15.0-1030.34\nNo subscription required",
