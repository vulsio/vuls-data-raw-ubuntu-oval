		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6:mcast: fix data-race in ipv6_mc_down / mld_ifc_work idev->mc_ifc_count canbe written over without proper locking. Originally found by syzbot [1], fixthis issue by encapsulating calls to mld_ifc_stop_work() (andmld_gq_stop_work() for good measure) with mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock()accordingly as these functions should only be called with mc_lock per theirdeclarations.
