This is inconsistent with the rest ofthe users of mirror_ds, which have if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(mirror_ds)) to keepfrom tripping over this exact scenario. Fix this up inff_layout_cancel_io() to make sure we don't panic when we get an error. Ialso spot checked all the other instances of checking mirror_ds and weappear to be doing the correct checks everywhere, only unconditionallydereferencing mirror_ds when we know it would be valid.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26868` to fix the vulnerability.
