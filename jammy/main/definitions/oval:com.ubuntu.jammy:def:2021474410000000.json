		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:thermal: Fix out-of-bounds memory accesses Currently, mlxsw allows coolingstates to be set above the maximum cooling state supported by the driver: #cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/type mlxsw_fan # cat/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/max_state 10 # echo 18 >/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/cur_state # echo $? 0 This resultsin out-of-bounds memory accesses when thermal state transition statisticsare enabled (CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS=y), as the transition table isaccessed with a too large index (state) [1]. According to the thermalmaintainer, it is the responsibility of the driver to reject suchoperations [2]. Therefore, return an error when the state to be set exceedsthe maximum cooling state supported by the driver. To avoid dead code, assuggested by the thermal maintainer [3], partially revert commita421ce088ac8 (\"mlxsw: core: Extend cooling device with cooling levels\")that tried to interpret these invalid cooling states (above the maximum) ina special way. The cooling levels array is not removed in order to preventthe fans going below 20% PWM, which would cause them to get stuck at 0%PWM.
