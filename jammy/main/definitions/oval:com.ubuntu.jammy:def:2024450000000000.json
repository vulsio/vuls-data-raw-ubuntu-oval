The cookie must not bewithdrawn until it drops to zero.The counter is checked by fscache_cookie_state_machine() beforeswitching to FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_RELINQUISHING andFSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_WITHDRAWING (in \"caseFSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_FAILED\"), but not forFSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_LRU_DISCARDING (\"caseFSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_ACTIVE\").This patch adds the missing check.  With a non-zero access counter,the function returns and the next fscache_end_cookie_access() callwill queue another fscache_cookie_state_machine() call to handle thestill-pending FSCACHE_COOKIE_DO_LRU_DISCARD.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45000` to fix the vulnerability.
