    "Title": "CVE-2023-3772 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to directly dereference a NULL pointer in xfrm_update_ae_params(), leading to a possible kernel crash and denial of service. Lin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3772` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-88.98\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-88.98\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic -
