		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:emu10k1: Fix out of bounds access in snd_emu10k1_pcm_channel_alloc() Thevoice allocator sometimes begins allocating from near the end of the arrayand then wraps around, however snd_emu10k1_pcm_channel_alloc() accesses thenewly allocated voices as if it never wrapped around. This results in outof bounds access if the first voice has a high enough index so thatfirst_voice + requested_voice_count > NUM_G (64). The more voices arerequested, the more likely it is for this to occur. This was initiallydiscovered using PipeWire, however it can be reproduced by calling aplaymultiple times with 16 channels: aplay -r 48000 -D plughw:CARD=Live,DEV=3-c 16 /dev/zero UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds insound/pci/emu10k1/emupcm.c:127:40 index 65 is out of range for type'snd_emu10k1_voice [64]' CPU: 1 PID: 31977 Comm: aplay Tainted: G W IOE6.0.0-rc2-emu10k1+ #7 Hardware name: ASUSTEK COMPUTER INC P5W DH Deluxe/P5WDH Deluxe, BIOS 3002 07/22/2010 Call Trace: <TASK> dump_stack_lvl+0x49/0x63dump_stack+0x10/0x16 ubsan_epilogue+0x9/0x3f__ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds.cold+0x44/0x49snd_emu10k1_playback_hw_params+0x3bc/0x420 [snd_emu10k1]snd_pcm_hw_params+0x29f/0x600 [snd_pcm] snd_pcm_common_ioctl+0x188/0x1410[snd_pcm] ? exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x35/0x170 ? do_syscall_64+0x69/0x90? syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x26/0x50 ? do_syscall_64+0x69/0x90 ?exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x35/0x170 snd_pcm_ioctl+0x27/0x40 [snd_pcm]__x64_sys_ioctl+0x95/0xd0 do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x90 ? do_syscall_64+0x69/0x90? do_syscall_64+0x69/0x90 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48702` to fix the vulnerability.
