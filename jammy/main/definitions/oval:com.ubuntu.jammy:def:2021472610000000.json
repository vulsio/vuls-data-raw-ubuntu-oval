		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:IB/mlx5: Fix initializing CQ fragments buffer The functioninit_cq_frag_buf() can be called to initialize the current CQ fragmentsbuffer cq->buf, or the temporary cq->resize_buf that is filled during CQresize operation. However, the offending commit started to use functionget_cqe() for getting the CQEs, the issue with this change is thatget_cqe() always returns CQEs from cq->buf, which leads us to initializethe wrong buffer, and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elementsbeyond the size of the current cq->buf and eventually hit a kernel panic.[exception RIP: init_cq_frag_buf+103] [ffff9f799ddcbcd8] mlx5_ib_resize_cqat ffffffffc0835d60 [mlx5_ib] [ffff9f799ddcbdb0] ib_resize_cq atffffffffc05270df [ib_core] [ffff9f799ddcbdc0] llt_rdma_setup_qp atffffffffc0a6a712 [llt] [ffff9f799ddcbe10] llt_rdma_cc_event_action atffffffffc0a6b411 [llt] [ffff9f799ddcbe98] llt_rdma_client_conn_thread atffffffffc0a6bb75 [llt] [ffff9f799ddcbec8] kthread at ffffffffa66c5da1[ffff9f799ddcbf50] ret_from_fork_nospec_begin at ffffffffa6d95ddd Fix it bygetting the needed CQE by calling mlx5_frag_buf_get_wqe() that takes thecorrect source buffer as a parameter.",
