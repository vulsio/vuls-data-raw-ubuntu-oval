    "Title": "CVE-2023-39198 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. The qxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returned handle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39198` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-90.100\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-90.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-90.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic-64k - 5.15.0-90.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1023-oem - 6.1.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1003-oem - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-90.100\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-90.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-90.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic-64k - 5.15.0-90.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1023-oem - 6.1.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1003-oem - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
