		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nexthop: Fix memory leaks in nexthop notification chain listeners syzkallerdiscovered memory leaks [1] that can be reduced to the following commands:# ip nexthop add id 1 blackhole # devlink dev reload pci/0000:06:00.0 Aspart of the reload flow, mlxsw will unregister its netdevs and thenunregister from the nexthop notification chain. Before unregistering fromthe notification chain, mlxsw will receive delete notifications for nexthopobjects using netdevs registered by mlxsw or their uppers. mlxsw will notreceive notifications for nexthops using netdevs that are not dismantled aspart of the reload flow. For example, the blackhole nexthop above thatinternally uses the loopback netdev as its nexthop device. One way to fixthis problem is to have listeners flush their nexthop tables afterunregistering from the notification chain. This is error-prone as evidentby this patch and also not symmetric with the registration path where alistener receives a dump of all the existing nexthops. Therefore, fix thisproblem by replaying delete notifications for the listener beingunregistered. This is symmetric to the registration path and alsoconsistent with the netdev notification chain. The above means thatunregister_nexthop_notifier(), like register_nexthop_notifier(), will haveto take RTNL in order to iterate over the existing nexthops and that anycallers of the function cannot hold RTNL. This is true for mlxsw andnetdevsim, but not for the VXLAN driver. To avoid a deadlock, change thelatter to unregister its nexthop listener without holding RTNL, making itsymmetric to the registration path.
