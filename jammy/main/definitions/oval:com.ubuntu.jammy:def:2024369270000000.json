		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv4:Fix uninit-value access in __ip_make_skb() KMSAN reported uninit-valueaccess in __ip_make_skb() [1]. __ip_make_skb() tests HDRINCL to know if theskb has icmphdr. However, HDRINCL can cause a race condition. If callingsetsockopt(2) with IP_HDRINCL changes HDRINCL while __ip_make_skb() isrunning, the function will access icmphdr in the skb even if it is notincluded. This causes the issue reported by KMSAN. CheckFLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH on fl4->flowi4_flags instead of testing HDRINCL on thesocket. Also, fl4->fl4_icmp_type and fl4->fl4_icmp_code are notinitialized. These are union in struct flowi4 and are implicitlyinitialized by flowi4_init_output(), but we should not rely on specificunion layout. Initialize these explicitly in raw_sendmsg().
