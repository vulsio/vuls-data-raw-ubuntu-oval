		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prevent UAF in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group()Al reported a possible use-after-free (UAF) inkvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group().It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doingfdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to beclosed by another thread. The close calls kvm_spapr_tce_release() andthen release_spapr_tce_table() (via call_rcu()) which frees `stt`.Although there are calls to rcu_read_lock() inkvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group() they are not sufficient to preventthe UAF, because `stt` is used outside the locked regions.With an artifcial delay after the fdput() and a userspace program whichtriggers the race, KASAN detects the UAF:  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free inkvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group+0x298/0x720 [kvm]  Read of size 4 at addr c000200027552c30 by task kvm-vfio/2505  CPU: 54 PID: 2505 Comm: kvm-vfio Not tainted6.10.0-rc3-next-20240612-dirty #1  Hardware name: 8335-GTH POWER9 0x4e1202 opal:skiboot-v6.5.3-35-g1851b2a06PowerNV  Call Trace:    dump_stack_lvl+0xb4/0x108 (unreliable)    print_report+0x2b4/0x6ec    kasan_report+0x118/0x2b0    __asan_load4+0xb8/0xd0    kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group+0x298/0x720 [kvm]    kvm_vfio_set_attr+0x524/0xac0 [kvm]    kvm_device_ioctl+0x144/0x240 [kvm]    sys_ioctl+0x62c/0x1810    system_call_exception+0x190/0x440    system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec  ...

To keep the patch minimal add a callto fdput() at each of the existing return paths. Future work can convertthe function to goto or __cleanup style cleanup.With the fix in place the test case no longer triggers the UAF.",
