		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fs: Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface functionWhen vfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface functionthen the 'nosec' should propagate into this function so thatvfs_getattr_nosec() can again be called from the filesystem's gettattrrather than vfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary securitychecks that the initial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid.Therefore, introduce the getattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to passwith the new getattr_flags parameter to the getattr interface function.In overlayfs and ecryptfs use this flag to determine which one of thetwo functions to call.In a recent code change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended upcalling vfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn calledsecurity_inode_getattr() on an exiting process that did not havecurrent->fs set anymore, which then caused a kernel NULL pointerdereference. With this change the call to security_inode_getattr() canbe avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointer dereference.",
