		"title": "CVE-2021-47430 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/entry: Clear X86_FEATURE_SMAP when CONFIG_X86_SMAP=n Commit3c73b81a9164 (\"x86/entry, selftests: Further improve user entry sanitychecks\") added a warning if AC is set when in the kernel. Commit662a0221893a3d (\"x86/entry: Fix AC assertion\") changed the warning to onlyfire if the CPU supports SMAP. However, the warning can still trigger on amachine that supports SMAP but where it's disabled in the kernel config andwhen running the syscall_nt selftest, for example: ------------[ cut here]------------ WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 49 at irqentry_enter_from_user_mode CPU:0 PID: 49 Comm: init Tainted: G T 5.15.0-rc4+ #98e6202628ee053b4f310759978284bd8bb0ce6905 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC(i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.10.2-1ubuntu1 04/01/2014 RIP:0010:irqentry_enter_from_user_mode ... Call Trace: ? irqentry_enter ?exc_general_protection ? asm_exc_general_protection ?asm_exc_general_protectio IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86_SMAP) could be added to thewarning condition, but even this would not be enough in case SMAP isdisabled at boot time with the \"nosmap\" parameter. To be consistent with\"nosmap\" behaviour, clear X86_FEATURE_SMAP when !CONFIG_X86_SMAP. Foundusing entry-fuzz + satrandconfig. [ bp: Massage commit message. ]",
