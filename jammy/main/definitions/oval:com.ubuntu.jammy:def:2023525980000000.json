		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/ptrace: handle setting of fpc register correctlyIf the content of the floating point control (fpc) register of a tracedprocess is modified with the ptrace interface the new value is tested forvalidity by temporarily loading it into the fpc register.This may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the tracing process:if an interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into thefpc register, and within interrupt context floating point or vectorregisters are used, the current fp/vx registers are saved withsave_fpu_regs() assuming they belong to user space and will be loaded intofp/vx registers when returning to user space.test_fp_ctl() restores the original user space fpc register value, howeverit will be discarded, when returning to user space.In result the tracer will incorrectly continue to run with the value thatwas supposed to be used for the traced process.Fix this by saving fpu register contents with save_fpu_regs() before usingtest_fp_ctl().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52598` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1035-oem - 6.1.0-1035.35\nNo subscription required",
