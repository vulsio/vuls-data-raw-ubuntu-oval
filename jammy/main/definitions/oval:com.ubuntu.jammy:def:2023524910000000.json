		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling inmtk_jpeg_dec_device_run In mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is boundwith mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work. In mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if errorhappens in mtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker whilemark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish. There are twomethods to trigger the bug. If we remove the module, it which will callmtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup. The possible sequence is as follows, whichwill cause a use-after-free bug. CPU0 CPU1 mtk_jpeg_dec_... | start worker| |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work mtk_jpeg_remove | v4l2_m2m_release |kfree(m2m_dev); | | | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv | m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use Ifwe close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release, it willhave a similar sequence. Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only ifstarted jpegdec worker successfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only becalled in either mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52491` to fix the vulnerability.
