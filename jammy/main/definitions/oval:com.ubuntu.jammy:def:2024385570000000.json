		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Reload only IB representors upon lag disable/enable On lagdisable, the bond IB device along with all of its representors aredestroyed, and then the slaves' representors get reloaded. In case theslave IB representor load fails, the eswitch error flow unloads allrepresentors, including ethernet representors, where the netdevs getdetached and removed from lag bond. Such flow is inaccurate as the lagdriver is not responsible for loading/unloading ethernet representors.Furthermore, the flow described above begins by holding lag lock to preventbond changes during disable flow. However, when reaching the ethernetrepresentors detachment from lag, the lag lock is required again,triggering the following deadlock: Call trace: __switch_to+0xf4/0x148__schedule+0x2c8/0x7d0 schedule+0x50/0xe0schedule_preempt_disabled+0x18/0x28 __mutex_lock.isra.13+0x2b8/0x570__mutex_lock_slowpath+0x1c/0x28 mutex_lock+0x4c/0x68mlx5_lag_remove_netdev+0x3c/0x1a0 [mlx5_core]mlx5e_uplink_rep_disable+0x70/0xa0 [mlx5_core]mlx5e_detach_netdev+0x6c/0xb0 [mlx5_core]mlx5e_netdev_change_profile+0x44/0x138 [mlx5_core]mlx5e_netdev_attach_nic_profile+0x28/0x38 [mlx5_core]mlx5e_vport_rep_unload+0x184/0x1b8 [mlx5_core]mlx5_esw_offloads_rep_load+0xd8/0xe0 [mlx5_core]mlx5_eswitch_reload_reps+0x74/0xd0 [mlx5_core] mlx5_disable_lag+0x130/0x138[mlx5_core] mlx5_lag_disable_change+0x6c/0x70 [mlx5_core] // holdldev->lock mlx5_devlink_eswitch_mode_set+0xc0/0x410 [mlx5_core]devlink_nl_cmd_eswitch_set_doit+0xdc/0x180genl_family_rcv_msg_doit.isra.17+0xe8/0x138 genl_rcv_msg+0xe4/0x220netlink_rcv_skb+0x44/0x108 genl_rcv+0x40/0x58 netlink_unicast+0x198/0x268netlink_sendmsg+0x1d4/0x418 sock_sendmsg+0x54/0x60 __sys_sendto+0xf4/0x120__arm64_sys_sendto+0x30/0x40 el0_svc_common+0x8c/0x120 do_el0_svc+0x30/0xa0el0_svc+0x20/0x30 el0_sync_handler+0x90/0xb8 el0_sync+0x160/0x180 Thus,upon lag enable/disable, load and unload only the IB representors of theslaves preventing the deadlock mentioned above.
