		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sysv:don't call sb_bread() with pointers_lock held syzbot is reporting sleep inatomic context in SysV filesystem [1], for sb_bread() is called withrw_spinlock held. A \"write_lock(&pointers_lock) =>read_lock(&pointers_lock) deadlock\" bug and a \"sb_bread() withwrite_lock(&pointers_lock)\" bug were introduced by \"Replace BKL for chainlocking with sysvfs-private rwlock\" in Linux 2.5.12. Then, \"[PATCH]err1-40: sysvfs locking fix\" in Linux 2.6.8 fixed the former bug by movingpointers_lock lock to the callers, but instead introduced a \"sb_bread()with read_lock(&pointers_lock)\" bug (which made this problem easier tohit). Al Viro suggested that why not to do like get_branch()/get_block()/find_shared() in Minix filesystem does. And doing like that is almost arevert of \"[PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix\" except that get_branch()from with find_shared() is called without write_lock(&pointers_lock).",
