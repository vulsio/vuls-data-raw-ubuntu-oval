However, it's not necessary to make such a large changein order to fix this bug; all we need to do is make sure thatudc->dev.driver is always NULL.In fact, there is no reason for udc->dev.driver ever to be set toanything, let alone to the value it currently gets: the address of thegadget's driver.  After all, a gadget driver only knows how to managea gadget, not how to manage a UDC.This patch simply removes the statements in the gadget core that touchudc->dev.driver.",
