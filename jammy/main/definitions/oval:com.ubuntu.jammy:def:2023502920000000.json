		"description": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control ofDynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0before 9.3.0.The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configureand test new Schemas and configSets.However, when the feature was created, the \"trust\" (authentication) ofthese configSets was not considered.External library loading is only available to configSets that are \"trusted\"(created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unableto perform Remote Code Execution.Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their \"trust\"into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users wereallowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-50292` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblucene3-contrib-java - 3.6.2+dfsg-24\nliblucene3-java - 3.6.2+dfsg-24\nNo subscription required",
