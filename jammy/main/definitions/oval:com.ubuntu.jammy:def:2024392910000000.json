		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: Fix buffer size in gfx_v9_4_3_init_ cp_compute_microcode() andrlc_microcode()The function gfx_v9_4_3_init_microcode in gfx_v9_4_3.c was generatingabout potential truncation of output when using the snprintf function.The issue was due to the size of the buffer 'ucode_prefix' being toosmall to accommodate the maximum possible length of the string beingwritten into it.The string being written is \"amdgpu/%s_mec.bin\" or \"amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin\",where %s is replaced by the value of 'chip_name'. The length of thisstring without the %s is 16 characters. The warning message indicatedthat 'chip_name' could be up to 29 characters long, resulting in a totalof 45 characters, which exceeds the buffer size of 30 characters.To resolve this issue, the size of the 'ucode_prefix' buffer has beenreduced from 30 to 15. This ensures that the maximum possible length ofthe string being written into the buffer will not exceed its size, thuspreventing potential buffer overflow and truncation issues.Fixes the below with gcc W=1:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c: In function‘gfx_v9_4_3_early_init’:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:379:52: warning: ‘%s’ directiveoutput may be truncated writing up to 29 bytes into a region of size 23[-Wformat-truncation=]  379 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin\",chip_name);      |                                                    ^~......  439 |         r = gfx_v9_4_3_init_rlc_microcode(adev, ucode_prefix);      |                                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:379:9: note: ‘snprintf’ outputbetween 16 and 45 bytes into a destination of size 30  379 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin\",chip_name);      |^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:413:52: warning: ‘%s’ directiveoutput may be truncated writing up to 29 bytes into a region of size 23[-Wformat-truncation=]  413 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_mec.bin\",chip_name);      |                                                    ^~......  443 |         r = gfx_v9_4_3_init_cp_compute_microcode(adev,ucode_prefix);      |                                                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:413:9: note: ‘snprintf’ outputbetween 16 and 45 bytes into a destination of size 30  413 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_mec.bin\",chip_name);      |^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
