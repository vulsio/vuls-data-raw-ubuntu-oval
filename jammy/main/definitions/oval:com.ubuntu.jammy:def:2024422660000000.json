		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: make cow_file_range_inline() honor locked_page on errorThe btrfs buffered write path runs through __extent_writepage() whichhas some tricky return value handling for writepage_delalloc().Specifically, when that returns 1, we exit, but for other return valueswe continue and end up calling btrfs_folio_end_all_writers(). If thefolio has been unlocked (note that we check the PageLocked bit at thestart of __extent_writepage()), this results in an assert panic likethis one from syzbot:  BTRFS: error (device loop0 state EAL) in free_log_tree:3267: errno=-5 IOfailure  BTRFS warning (device loop0 state EAL): Skipping commit of abortedtransaction.
