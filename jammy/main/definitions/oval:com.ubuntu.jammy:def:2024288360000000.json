		"description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.5.x before 3.6.0. When negotiatingthe TLS version on the server side, it can fall back to the TLS 1.2implementation of the protocol if it is disabled. If the TLS 1.2implementation was disabled at build time, a TLS 1.2 client could put a TLS1.3-only server into an infinite loop processing a TLS 1.2 ClientHello,resulting in a denial of service. If the TLS 1.2 implementation wasdisabled at runtime, a TLS 1.2 client can successfully establish a TLS 1.2connection with the server.",
