		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation inDCN301'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registersstructures. The array is initialized with four elements, correspondingto the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. Thismeans that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.The error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5 below, is indicating thatthere is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which isout of bounds. This could lead to undefined behaviorHere, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. Ifeng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on thestream_enc_regs array.Thus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn301_stream_encoder_createreported by Smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn301/dcn301_resource.c:1011dcn301_stream_encoder_create() error: buffer overflow 'stream_enc_regs' 4<= 5",
