		"Title": "CVE-2023-4807 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"Description": "Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state ofapplications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. Impact summary: If inan application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can influencewhether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might becorrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC(message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save thecontents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform whencalculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to thecaller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring theirprevious content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. The consequences ofthis kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from noconsequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents ofnon-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where theattacker could get complete control of the application process. Howevergiven the contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attackercannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any,would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations ora crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is mostfrequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticatedencryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of thisAEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. Thisimplies that server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted.However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that wouldbe affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severitysecurity issue. As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can bedisabled at runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000 The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.",
