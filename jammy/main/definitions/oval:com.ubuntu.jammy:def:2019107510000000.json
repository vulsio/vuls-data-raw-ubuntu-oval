		"Title": "CVE-2019-10751 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "All versions of the HTTPie package prior to version 1.0.3 are vulnerable to Open Redirect that allows an attacker to write an arbitrary file with supplied filename and content to the current directory, by redirecting a request from HTTP to a crafted URL pointing to a server in his or hers control. It was discovered that HTTPie did not properly generate output filenames under certain circumstances. A remote attacker could use this to possibly write arbitrary files, resulting in open redirect attacks.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10751` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhttpie - 1.0.3-2\nNo subscription required",
