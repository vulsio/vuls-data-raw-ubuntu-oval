		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Fix data races in unix_release_sock/unix_stream_sendmsg Adata-race condition has been identified in af_unix. In one data path, thewrite function unix_release_sock() atomically writes to sk->sk_shutdownusing WRITE_ONCE. However, on the reader side, unix_stream_sendmsg() doesnot read it atomically. Consequently, this issue is causing the followingKCSAN splat to occur: BUG: KCSAN: data-race in unix_release_sock /unix_stream_sendmsg write (marked) to 0xffff88867256ddbb of 1 bytes by task7270 on cpu 28: unix_release_sock (net/unix/af_unix.c:640) unix_release(net/unix/af_unix.c:1050) sock_close (net/socket.c:659 net/socket.c:1421)__fput (fs/file_table.c:422) __fput_sync (fs/file_table.c:508)__se_sys_close (fs/open.c:1559 fs/open.c:1541) __x64_sys_close(fs/open.c:1541) x64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:33)do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:?) entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe(arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130) read to 0xffff88867256ddbb of 1 bytes bytask 989 on cpu 14: unix_stream_sendmsg (net/unix/af_unix.c:2273)__sock_sendmsg (net/socket.c:730 net/socket.c:745) ____sys_sendmsg(net/socket.c:2584) __sys_sendmmsg (net/socket.c:2638 net/socket.c:2724)__x64_sys_sendmmsg (net/socket.c:2753 net/socket.c:2750 net/socket.c:2750)x64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:33) do_syscall_64(arch/x86/entry/common.c:?) entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe(arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130) value changed: 0x01 -> 0x03 The linenumbers are related to commit dd5a440a31fa (\"Linux 6.9-rc7\"). Commite1d09c2c2f57 (\"af_unix: Fix data races around sk->sk_shutdown.\") addresseda comparable issue in the past regarding sk->sk_shutdown. However, itoverlooked resolving this particular data path.
