		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Fix data races in unix_release_sock/unix_stream_sendmsgA data-race condition has been identified in af_unix. In one data path,the write function unix_release_sock() atomically writes tosk->sk_shutdown using WRITE_ONCE. However, on the reader side,unix_stream_sendmsg() does not read it atomically. Consequently, thisissue is causing the following KCSAN splat to occur:\tBUG: KCSAN: data-race in unix_release_sock / unix_stream_sendmsg\twrite (marked) to 0xffff88867256ddbb of 1 bytes by task 7270 on cpu 28:\tunix_release_sock (net/unix/af_unix.c:640)\tunix_release (net/unix/af_unix.c:1050)\tsock_close (net/socket.c:659 net/socket.c:1421)\t__fput (fs/file_table.c:422)\t__fput_sync (fs/file_table.c:508)\t__se_sys_close (fs/open.c:1559 fs/open.c:1541)\t__x64_sys_close (fs/open.c:1541)\tx64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:33)\tdo_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:?)\tentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)\tread to 0xffff88867256ddbb of 1 bytes by task 989 on cpu 14:\tunix_stream_sendmsg (net/unix/af_unix.c:2273)\t__sock_sendmsg (net/socket.c:730 net/socket.c:745)\t____sys_sendmsg (net/socket.c:2584)\t__sys_sendmmsg (net/socket.c:2638 net/socket.c:2724)\t__x64_sys_sendmmsg (net/socket.c:2753 net/socket.c:2750 net/socket.c:2750)\tx64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:33)\tdo_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:?)\tentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)\tvalue changed: 0x01 -> 0x03The line numbers are related to commit dd5a440a31fa (\"Linux 6.9-rc7\").Commit e1d09c2c2f57 (\"af_unix: Fix data races around sk->sk_shutdown.\")addressed a comparable issue in the past regarding sk->sk_shutdown.However, it overlooked resolving this particular data path.This patch only offending unix_stream_sendmsg() function, since theother reads seem to be protected by unix_state_lock() as discussed in",
