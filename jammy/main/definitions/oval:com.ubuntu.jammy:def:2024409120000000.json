		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mac80211: Fix deadlock in ieee80211_sta_ps_deliver_wakeup()The ieee80211_sta_ps_deliver_wakeup() function takes sta->ps_lock tosynchronizes with ieee80211_tx_h_unicast_ps_buf() which is called fromsoftirq context. However using only spin_lock() to get sta->ps_lock inieee80211_sta_ps_deliver_wakeup() does not prevent softirq to executeon this same CPU, to run ieee80211_tx_h_unicast_ps_buf() and try totake this same lock ending in deadlock.
