		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: afs:Fix endless loop in directory parsing If a directory has a block with only\".__afsXXXX\" files in it (from uncompleted silly-rename), these .__afsXXXXfiles are skipped but without advancing the file position in thedir_context. This leads to afs_dir_iterate() repeating the block again andagain. Fix this by making the code that skips the .__afsXXXX file alsomanually advance the file position. The symptoms are a soft lookup:watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#3 stuck for 52s! [check:5737] ...
