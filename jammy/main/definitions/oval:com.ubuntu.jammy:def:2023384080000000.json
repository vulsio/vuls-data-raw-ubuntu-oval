		"Title": "CVE-2023-38408 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38408` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.3\nopenssh-server - 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.3\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.3\nopenssh-tests - 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.3\nssh - 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.3\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.3\nNo subscription required",
