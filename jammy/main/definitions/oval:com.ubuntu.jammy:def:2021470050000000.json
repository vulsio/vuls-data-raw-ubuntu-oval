Let us add a check forpci_epc_feature pointer in pci_epf_test_bind before we access it to avoidany such NULL pointer dereference and return -ENOTSUPP in casepci_epc_feature is not found.When the patch is not applied and EPC features is not implemented in theplatform driver, we see the following dump due to kernel NULL pointerdereference.Call trace: pci_epf_test_bind+0xf4/0x388 pci_epf_bind+0x3c/0x80 pci_epc_epf_link+0xa8/0xcc configfs_symlink+0x1a4/0x48c vfs_symlink+0x104/0x184 do_symlinkat+0x80/0xd4 __arm64_sys_symlinkat+0x1c/0x24 el0_svc_common.constprop.3+0xb8/0x170 el0_svc_handler+0x70/0x88 el0_svc+0x8/0x640Code: d2800581 b9403ab9 f9404ebb 8b394f60 (f9400400)---[ end trace a438e3c5a24f9df0 ]---",
