		"Title": "CVE-2023-38432 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.10. fs/smb/server/smb2misc.c in ksmbd does not validate the relationship between the command payload size and the RFC1002 length specification, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate command payload size, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38432` to fix the vulnerability.
