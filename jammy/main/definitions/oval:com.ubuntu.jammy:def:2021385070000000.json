    "Title": "CVE-2021-38507 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-38507` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nthunderbird - 1:91.3.1+build1-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:91.3.1+build1-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:91.3.1+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:91.3.1+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:91.3.1+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:91.3.1+build1-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
