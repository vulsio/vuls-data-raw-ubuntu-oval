Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack andcluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the diskrepresentation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is alwaysnull terminated.  This causes a read outside of the source stringtriggering the buffer overflow detection.  detected buffer overflow in strlen  ------------[ cut here ]------------  kernel BUG at lib/string.c:1149!  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI  CPU: 1 PID: 910 Comm: mount.ocfs2 Not tainted 5.14.0-1-amd64 #1    Debian 5.14.6-2  RIP: 0010:fortify_panic+0xf/0x11  ...
