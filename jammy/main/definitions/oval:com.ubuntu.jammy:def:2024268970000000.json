		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:ath9k: delay all of ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() until init is complete Theath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() used in ath9k_htc assumes that all the datastructures have been fully initialised by the time it runs. However,because of the order in which things are initialised, this is notguaranteed to be the case, because the device is exposed to the USBsubsystem before the ath9k driver initialisation is completed. We alreadycommitted a partial fix for this in commit: 8b3046abc99e (\"ath9k_htc: fixNULL pointer dereference at ath9k_htc_tx_get_packet()\") However, thatcommit only aborted the WMI_TXSTATUS_EVENTID command in the event tasklet,pairing it with an \"initialisation complete\" bit in the TX struct. It seemssyzbot managed to trigger the race for one of the other commands as well,so let's just move the existing synchronisation bit to cover the wholetasklet (setting it at the end of ath9k_htc_probe_device() instead ofinside ath9k_tx_init()).",
