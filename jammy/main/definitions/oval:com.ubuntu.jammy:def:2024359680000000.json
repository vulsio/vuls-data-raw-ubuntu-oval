		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pds_core: Fix pdsc_check_pci_health function to use work threadWhen the driver notices fw_status == 0xff it tries to perform a PCIreset on itself via pci_reset_function() in the context of the driver'shealth thread. However, pdsc_reset_prepare callspdsc_stop_health_thread(), which attempts to stop/flush the healththread. This results in a deadlock because the stop/flush will nevercomplete since the driver called pci_reset_function() from the healththread context. Fix by changing the pdsc_check_pci_health_function()to queue a newly introduced pdsc_pci_reset_thread() on the pdsc'swork queue.Unloading the driver in the fw_down/dead state uncovered another issue,which can be seen in the following trace:WARNING: CPU: 51 PID: 6914 at kernel/workqueue.c:1450__queue_work+0x358/0x440[...]RIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x358/0x440[...]Call Trace: <TASK> ? __warn+0x85/0x140 ? __queue_work+0x358/0x440 ? report_bug+0xfc/0x1e0 ? handle_bug+0x3f/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 ? __queue_work+0x358/0x440 queue_work_on+0x28/0x30 pdsc_devcmd_locked+0x96/0xe0 [pds_core] pdsc_devcmd_reset+0x71/0xb0 [pds_core] pdsc_teardown+0x51/0xe0 [pds_core] pdsc_remove+0x106/0x200 [pds_core] pci_device_remove+0x37/0xc0 device_release_driver_internal+0xae/0x140 driver_detach+0x48/0x90 bus_remove_driver+0x6d/0xf0 pci_unregister_driver+0x2e/0xa0 pdsc_cleanup_module+0x10/0x780 [pds_core] __x64_sys_delete_module+0x142/0x2b0 ? syscall_trace_enter.isra.18+0x126/0x1a0 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x72/0xdcRIP: 0033:0x7fbd9d03a14b[...]Fix this by preventing the devcmd reset if the FW is not running.",
