		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Input:powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete syzbot hasfound a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver. This happens whenthe device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from thepowermate_device struct. When an asynchronous control message completesafter the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not existanymore and hence the bug. Use usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel anyin-progress requests upon device disconnection. [1]https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=0434ac83f907a1dbdd1e",
