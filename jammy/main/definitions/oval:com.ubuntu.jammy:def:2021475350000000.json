		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/msm/a6xx: Allocate enough space for GMU registers In commit142639a52a01 (\"drm/msm/a6xx: fix crashstate capture for A650\") we changeda6xx_get_gmu_registers() to read 3 sets of registers. Unfortunately, wedidn't change the memory allocation for the array. That leads to a KASANwarning (this was on the chromeos-5.4 kernel, which has the problematiccommit backported to it): BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in_a6xx_get_gmu_registers+0x144/0x430 Write of size 8 at addrffffff80c89432b0 by task A618-worker/209 CPU: 5 PID: 209 Comm: A618-workerTainted: G W 5.4.156-lockdep #22 Hardware name: Google Lazor Limozeenwithout Touchscreen (rev5 - rev8) (DT) Call trace: dump_backtrace+0x0/0x248show_stack+0x20/0x2c dump_stack+0x128/0x1ecprint_address_description+0x88/0x4a0 __kasan_report+0xfc/0x120kasan_report+0x10/0x18 __asan_report_store8_noabort+0x1c/0x24_a6xx_get_gmu_registers+0x144/0x430 a6xx_gpu_state_get+0x330/0x25d4msm_gpu_crashstate_capture+0xa0/0x84c recover_worker+0x328/0x838kthread_worker_fn+0x32c/0x574 kthread+0x2dc/0x39c ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18Allocated by task 209: __kasan_kmalloc+0xfc/0x1c4 kasan_kmalloc+0xc/0x14kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x1f0/0x2a0 a6xx_gpu_state_get+0x164/0x25d4msm_gpu_crashstate_capture+0xa0/0x84c recover_worker+0x328/0x838kthread_worker_fn+0x32c/0x574 kthread+0x2dc/0x39c ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18",
