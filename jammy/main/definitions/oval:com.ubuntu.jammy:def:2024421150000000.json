It was found that all variables in thejffs_inode_infostructure were 5a5a5a5a, except for the first member sem. It is suspectedthat thesevariables are not initialized because they were set to 5a5a5a5a duringmemory testing,which is meant to detect uninitialized memory.The sem variable isinitialized in thefunction jffs2_i_init_once, while other members are initialized inthe function jffs2_init_inode_info.The function jffs2_init_inode_info is called after iget_locked,but in the iget_locked function, the destroy_inode process is triggered,which releases the inode and consequently, the target member of the inodeis not initialized.In concurrent high pressure scenarios, iget_lockedmay enter the destroy_inode branch as described in the code.Since the destroy_inode functionality of jffs2 only releases the target,the fix method is to set target to NULL in jffs2_i_init_once.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42115` to fix the vulnerability.
