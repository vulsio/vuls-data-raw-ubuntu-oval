		"title": "CVE-2024-35977 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition Thecros_ec_uart_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open() before itcalls serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This can trigger a NULL pointerdereference: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:0000000000000000 ... Call Trace: <TASK> ... ? ttyport_receive_buf Asimplified version of crashing code is as follows: static inline size_tserdev_controller_receive_buf(struct serdev_controller *ctrl, const u8*data, size_t count) { struct serdev_device *serdev = ctrl->serdev; if(!serdev || !serdev->ops->receive_buf) // CRASH! return 0; returnserdev->ops->receive_buf(serdev, data, count); } It assumes that ifSERPORT_ACTIVE is set and serdev exists, serdev->ops will also exist. Thisconflicts with the existing cros_ec_uart_probe() logic, as it first callsdevm_serdev_device_open() (which sets SERPORT_ACTIVE), and only later setsserdev->ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). Commit 01f95d42b8f4(\"platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: fix race condition\") attempted to fix asimilar race condition, but while doing so, made the window of error forthis race condition to happen much wider. Attempt to fix the race conditionagain, making sure we fully setup before calling devm_serdev_device_open().",
