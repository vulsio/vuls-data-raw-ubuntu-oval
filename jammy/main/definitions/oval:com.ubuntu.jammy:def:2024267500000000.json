		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Drop oob_skb ref before purging queue in GC. syzbot reportedanother task hung in __unix_gc(). [0] The current while loop assumes thatall of the left candidates have oob_skb and calling kfree_skb(oob_skb)releases the remaining candidates. However, I missed a case that oob_skbhas self-referencing fd and another fd and the latter sk is placed beforethe former in the candidate list. Then, the while loop never proceeds,resulting the task hung. __unix_gc() has the same loop just before purgingthe collected skb, so we can call kfree_skb(oob_skb) there and let__skb_queue_purge() release all inflight sockets.
