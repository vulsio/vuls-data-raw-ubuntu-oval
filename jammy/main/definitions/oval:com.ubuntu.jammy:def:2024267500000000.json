		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Drop oob_skb ref before purging queue in GC.syzbot reported another task hung in __unix_gc().  [0]The current while loop assumes that all of the left candidateshave oob_skb and calling kfree_skb(oob_skb) releases the remainingcandidates.However, I missed a case that oob_skb has self-referencing fd andanother fd and the latter sk is placed before the former in thecandidate list.  Then, the while loop never proceeds, resultingthe task hung.__unix_gc() has the same loop just before purging the collected skb,so we can call kfree_skb(oob_skb) there and let __skb_queue_purge()release all inflight sockets.[0]:Sending NMI from CPU 0 to CPUs 1:NMI backtrace for cpu 1CPU: 1 PID: 2784 Comm: kworker/u4:8 Not tainted6.8.0-rc4-syzkaller-01028-g71b605d32017 #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 01/25/2024Workqueue: events_unbound __unix_gcRIP: 0010:__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc+0x0/0x70 kernel/kcov.c:200Code: 89 fb e8 23 00 00 00 48 8b 3d 84 f5 1a 0c 48 89 de 5b e9 43 26 57 000f 1f 00 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 <f3> 0f 1e fa 488b 04 24 65 48 8b 0d 90 52 70 7e 65 8b 15 91 52 70RSP: 0018:ffffc9000a17fa78 EFLAGS: 00000287RAX: ffffffff8a0a6108 RBX: ffff88802b6c2640 RCX: ffff88802c0b3b80RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000002 RDI: 0000000000000000RBP: ffffc9000a17fbf0 R08: ffffffff89383f1d R09: 1ffff1100ee5ff84R10: dffffc0000000000 R11: ffffed100ee5ff85 R12: 1ffff110056d84eeR13: ffffc9000a17fae0 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffffffff8f47b840FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b9500000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007ffef5687ff8 CR3: 0000000029b34000 CR4: 00000000003506f0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400Call Trace: <NMI> </NMI> <TASK> __unix_gc+0xe69/0xf40 net/unix/garbage.c:343 process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:2633 [inline] process_scheduled_works+0x913/0x1420 kernel/workqueue.c:2706 worker_thread+0xa5f/0x1000 kernel/workqueue.c:2787 kthread+0x2ef/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:388 ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:242 </TASK>",
