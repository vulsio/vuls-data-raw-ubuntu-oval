		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption When tc filters are first added toa net device, the corresponding local port gets bound to an ACL group inthe device. The group contains a list of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points toa different TCAM region where the filters are stored. During forwarding,the ACLs are sequentially evaluated until a match is found. One reason toplace filters in different regions is when they are added with decreasingpriorities and in an alternating order so that two consecutive filters cannever fit in the same region because of their key usage. In Spectrum-2 andnewer ASICs the firmware started to report that the maximum number of ACLsin a group is more than 16, but the layout of the register that configuresACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account for that. It is thereforepossible to hit stack corruption [1] in the rare case where more than 16ACLs in a group are required. Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size tothe minimum between what the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fitin the PAGT register. Add a test case to make sure the machine does notcrash when this condition is hit.
