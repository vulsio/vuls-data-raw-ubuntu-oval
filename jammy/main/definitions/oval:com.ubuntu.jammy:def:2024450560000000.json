		"description": "zksolc is a Solidity compiler for ZKsync. All LLVM versions since 2015 fold`(xor (shl 1, x), -1)` to `(rotl ~1, x)` if run with optimizations enabled.Here `~1` is generated as an unsigned 64 bits number (`2^64-1`). Thisnumber is zero-extended to 256 bits on EraVM target while it should havebeen sign-extended. Thus instead of producing `roti 2^256 - 1, x` thecompiler produces `rotl 2^64 - 1, x`. Analysis has shown that no contractswere affected by the date of publishing this advisory. This issue has beenaddressed in version 1.5.3. Users are advised to upgrade and redeploy allcontracts. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
