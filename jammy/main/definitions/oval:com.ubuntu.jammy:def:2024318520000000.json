		"description": "LLVM before 18.1.3 generates code in which the LR register can beoverwritten without data being saved to the stack, and thus there cansometimes be an exploitable error in the flow of control. This affects theARM backend and can be demonstrated with Clang. NOTE: the vendorperspective is \"we don't have strong objections for a CVE to be created ...It does seem that the likelihood of this miscompile enabling an exploitremains very low, because the miscompile resulting in this JOP gadget issuch that the function is most likely to crash on most valid inputs to thefunction. So, if this function is covered by any testing, the miscompile ismost likely to be discovered before the binary is shipped to production.\"",
