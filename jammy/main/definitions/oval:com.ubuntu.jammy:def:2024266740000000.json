		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/lib: Revert to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user() fixups Duringmemory error injection test on kernels >= v6.4, the kernel panics likebelow. However, this issue couldn't be reproduced on kernels <= v6.3. mce:[Hardware Error]: CPU 296: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 1:bd80000000100134 mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffff821b9776>{__get_user_nocheck_4+0x6/0x20} mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC 411a93533ed ADDR346a8730040 MISC 86 mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:a06d0 TIME1706000767 SOCKET 1 APIC 211 microcode 80001490 mce: [Hardware Error]: Runthe above through 'mcelog --ascii' mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check:Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatallocal machine check The MCA code can recover from an in-kernel #MC if thefixup type is EX_TYPE_UACCESS, explicitly indicating that the kernel isattempting to access userspace memory. However, if the fixup type isEX_TYPE_DEFAULT the only thing that is raised for an in-kernel #MC is apanic. ex_handler_uaccess() would warn if users gave a non-canonicaladdresses (with bit 63 clear) to {get, put}_user(), which was unexpected.Therefore, commit b19b74bc99b1 (\"x86/mm: Rework address range check inget_user() and put_user()\") replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE()for {get, put}_user() fixups. However, the new fixup type EX_TYPE_DEFAULTresults in a panic. Commit 6014bc27561f (\"x86-64: make access_ok()independent of LAM\") added the check gp_fault_address_ok() right before theWARN_ONCE() in ex_handler_uaccess() to not warn about non-canonical useraddresses due to LAM. With that in place, revert back to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA()for {get,put}_user() exception fixups in order to be able to handlein-kernel MCEs correctly again.
