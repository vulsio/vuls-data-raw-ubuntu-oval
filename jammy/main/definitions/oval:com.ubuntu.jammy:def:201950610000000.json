Thiscould lead to different denial of service scenarios, either by causing CAMtable attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking already existingclients in other nearby Aps of the same wireless infrastructure. Anattacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets totrigger this vulnerability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-5061` to fix the vulnerability.
