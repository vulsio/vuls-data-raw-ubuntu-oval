		"Title": "CVE-2022-31117 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with bindings for Python 3.7+. In versions prior to 5.4.0 an error occurring while reallocating a buffer for string decoding can cause the buffer to get freed twice. Due to how UltraJSON uses the internal decoder, this double free is impossible to trigger from Python. This issue has been resolved in version 5.4.0 and all users should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

		"Note": "ccdm94> the embedded ujson code in pandas, eventhough containing similar content as the upstream ujson code, seems to have diverged from the ujson upstream project (they have fully forked ujson), since pandas upstream is maintaining their own ujson bug fixes and changes without re-syncing with the ujson upstream project. There is no indication the ujson fork, as used in pandas, is vulnerable to the same issues as the upstream ujson code."
