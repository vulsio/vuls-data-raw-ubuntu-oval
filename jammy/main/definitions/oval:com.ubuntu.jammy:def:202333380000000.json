		"Title": "CVE-2023-3338 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DECnet networking protocol. This issue could allow a remote user to crash the system. Davide Ornaghi discovered that the DECnet network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. Please note that kernel support for the DECnet has been removed to resolve this CVE.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3338` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic-64k - 5.15.0-86.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-aws - 5.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-aws - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure - 5.15.0-1049.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-azure - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1049.56.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gcp - 5.15.0-1044.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-gcp - 6.2.0-1009.9~22.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gke - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gkeop - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic-64k - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-ibm - 5.15.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-kvm - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency - 5.15.0-86.95\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-86.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-nvidia - 5.15.0-1037.37\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1037.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-oracle - 5.15.0-1045.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-1040-raspi - 5.15.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic-64k - 5.15.0-86.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-aws - 5.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-aws - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure - 5.15.0-1049.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-azure - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1049.56.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-azure-fde - 6.2.0-1005.5~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gcp - 5.15.0-1044.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-gcp - 6.2.0-1009.9~22.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gke - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gkeop - 5.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-6.2.0-25-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-25-generic-64k - 6.2.0-25.25~22.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-ibm - 5.15.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-kvm - 5.15.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency - 5.15.0-86.95\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-86.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1008.8~22.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-nvidia - 5.15.0-1037.37\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-nvidia-lowlatency - 5.15.0-1037.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-1004-oem - 6.1.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-oracle - 5.15.0-1045.51\nNo subscription required",
