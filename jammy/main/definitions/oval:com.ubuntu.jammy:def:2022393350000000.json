		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by theMatrix.org Foundation. The Matrix Federation API allows remote homeserversto request the authorization events in a room. This is necessary so that ahomeserver receiving some events can validate that those events arelegitimate and permitted in their room. However, in versions of Synapse upto and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver answering a query forauthorization events does not sufficiently check that the requesting servershould be able to access them. The issue was patched in Synapse 1.69.0.Homeserver administrators are advised to upgrade.",
