		"title": "CVE-2022-31146 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in theWasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, where functions using reference typesmay be incorrectly missing metadata required for runtime garbagecollection. This means that if a GC happens at runtime then the GC passwill mistakenly think these functions do not have live references to GC'dvalues, reclaiming them and deallocating them. The function will thensubsequently continue to use the values assuming they had not been GC'd,leading later to a use-after-free. This bug was introduced in the migrationto the `regalloc2` register allocator that occurred in the Wasmtime 0.37.0release on 2022-05-20. This bug has been patched and users should upgradeto Wasmtime version 0.38.2. Mitigations for this issue can be achieved bydisabling the reference types proposal by passing `false` to`wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types` or downgrading to Wasmtime 0.36.0or prior.",
