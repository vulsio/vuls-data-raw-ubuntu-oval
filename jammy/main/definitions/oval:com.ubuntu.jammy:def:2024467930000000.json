		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer deref in BYT/CHT boards harderSince commit 13f58267cda3 (\"ASoC: soc.h: don't create dummy Componentvia COMP_DUMMY()\") dummy codecs declared like this:SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEF(dummy,        DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY(COMP_DUMMY()));expand to:static struct snd_soc_dai_link_component dummy[] = {};Which means that dummy is a zero sized array and thus dais[i].codecs shouldnot be dereferenced *at all* since it points to the address of the nextvariable stored in the data section as the \"dummy\" variable has an addressbut no size, so even dereferencing dais[0] is already an out of boundsarray reference.Which means that the if (dais[i].codecs->name) check added incommit 7d99a70b6595 (\"ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer derefin BYT/CHT boards\") relies on that the part of the next variable whichthe name member maps to just happens to be NULL.Which apparently so far it usually is, except when it isn'tand then it results in crashes like this one:[   28.795659] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address:0000000000030011...[   28.795780] Call Trace:[   28.795787]  <TASK>...[   28.795862]  ? strcmp+0x18/0x40[   28.795872]  0xffffffffc150c605[   28.795887]  platform_probe+0x40/0xa0...[   28.795979]  ? __pfx_init_module+0x10/0x10 [snd_soc_sst_bytcr_wm5102]Really fix things this time around by checking dais.num_codecs != 0.",
