		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tcp:Fix shift-out-of-bounds in dctcp_update_alpha(). In dctcp_update_alpha(),we use a module parameter dctcp_shift_g as follows: alpha -=min_not_zero(alpha, alpha >> dctcp_shift_g); ... delivered_ce <<= (10 -dctcp_shift_g); It seems syzkaller started fuzzing module parameters andtriggered shift-out-of-bounds [0] by setting 100 to dctcp_shift_g:memcpy((void*)0x20000080,\"/sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g\\000\", 47); res =syscall(__NR_openat, /*fd=*/0xffffffffffffff9cul, /*file=*/0x20000080ul,/*flags=*/2ul, /*mode=*/0ul); memcpy((void*)0x20000000, \"100\\000\", 4);syscall(__NR_write, /*fd=*/r[0], /*val=*/0x20000000ul, /*len=*/4ul); Let'slimit the max value of dctcp_shift_g by param_set_uint_minmax().
