		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: veth:ensure skb entering GRO are not cloned. After commit d3256efd8e8b (\"veth:allow enabling NAPI even without XDP\"), if GRO is enabled on a veth deviceand TSO is disabled on the peer device, TCP skbs will go through the NAPIcallback. If there is no XDP program attached, the veth code does notperform any share check, and shared/cloned skbs could enter the GRO engine.Ignat reported a BUG triggered later-on due to the above condition: [53.970529][ C1] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:3574!
