		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: enetc: deny offload of tc-based TSN features on VF interfacesTSN features on the ENETC (taprio, cbs, gate, police) are configuredthrough a mix of command BD ring messages and port registers:enetc_port_rd(), enetc_port_wr().Port registers are a region of the ENETC memory map which are onlyaccessible from the PCIe Physical Function. They are not accessible fromthe Virtual Functions.Moreover, attempting to access these registers crashes the kernel:$ echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\\:00\\:00.0/sriov_numvfspci 0000:00:01.0: [1957:ef00] type 00 class 0x020001fsl_enetc_vf 0000:00:01.0: Adding to iommu group 15fsl_enetc_vf 0000:00:01.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)fsl_enetc_vf 0000:00:01.0 eno0vf0: renamed from eth0$ tc qdisc replace dev eno0vf0 root taprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \\\tqueues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 base-time 0 \\\tsched-entry S 0x7f 900000 sched-entry S 0x80 100000 flags 0x2Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff800009551a08Internal error: Oops: 96000007 [#1] PREEMPT SMPpc : enetc_setup_tc_taprio+0x170/0x47clr : enetc_setup_tc_taprio+0x16c/0x47cCall trace: enetc_setup_tc_taprio+0x170/0x47c enetc_setup_tc+0x38/0x2dc taprio_change+0x43c/0x970 taprio_init+0x188/0x1e0 qdisc_create+0x114/0x470 tc_modify_qdisc+0x1fc/0x6c0 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x12c/0x390Split enetc_setup_tc() into separate functions for the PF and for theVF drivers.
