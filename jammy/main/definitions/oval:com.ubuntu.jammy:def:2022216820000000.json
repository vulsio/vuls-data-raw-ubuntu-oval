		"description": "Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. Apath traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. Atthis point the build directory will have the full access that is specifiedin the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain thosepermissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem.However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builderwill launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utilsmirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even withthe `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is thatthese empty directories can be created wherever the user has writepermissions. However, a malicious application could replace the`appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This hasbeen resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of`--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.",
