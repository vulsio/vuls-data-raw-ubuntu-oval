		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: isotp: fix potential CAN frame reception race in isotp_rcv()When receiving a CAN frame the current code logic does not considerconcurrently receiving processes which do not show up in real worldusage.Ziyang Xuan writes:The following syz problem is one of the scenarios. so->rx.len ischanged by isotp_rcv_ff() during isotp_rcv_cf(), so->rx.len equals0 before alloc_skb() and equals 4096 after alloc_skb(). That willtrigger skb_over_panic() in skb_put().=======================================================CPU: 1 PID: 19 Comm: ksoftirqd/1 Not tainted 5.16.0-rc8-syzkaller #0RIP: 0010:skb_panic+0x16c/0x16e net/core/skbuff.c:113Call Trace: <TASK> skb_over_panic net/core/skbuff.c:118 [inline] skb_put.cold+0x24/0x24 net/core/skbuff.c:1990 isotp_rcv_cf net/can/isotp.c:570 [inline] isotp_rcv+0xa38/0x1e30 net/can/isotp.c:668 deliver net/can/af_can.c:574 [inline] can_rcv_filter+0x445/0x8d0 net/can/af_can.c:635 can_receive+0x31d/0x580 net/can/af_can.c:665 can_rcv+0x120/0x1c0 net/can/af_can.c:696 __netif_receive_skb_one_core+0x114/0x180 net/core/dev.c:5465 __netif_receive_skb+0x24/0x1b0 net/core/dev.c:5579Therefore we make sure the state changes and data structures stayconsistent at CAN frame reception time by adding a spin_lock inisotp_rcv().
