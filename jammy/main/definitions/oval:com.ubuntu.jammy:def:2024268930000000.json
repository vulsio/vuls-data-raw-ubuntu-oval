		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware: arm_scmi: Fix double free in SMC transport cleanup pathWhen the generic SCMI code tears down a channel, it calls the chan_freecallback function, defined by each transport. Since multiple protocolsmight share the same transport_info member, chan_free() might want toclean up the same member multiple times within the given SCMI transportimplementation. In this case, it is SMC transport. This will lead to a NULLpointer dereference at the second time:    | scmi_protocol scmi_dev.1: Enabled polling mode TX channel -prot_id:16    | arm-scmi firmware:scmi: SCMI Notifications - Core Enabled.    | arm-scmi firmware:scmi: unable to communicate with SCMI    | Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address0000000000000000    | Mem abort info:    |   ESR = 0x0000000096000004    |   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits    |   SET = 0, FnV = 0    |   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0    |   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault    | Data abort info:    |   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004, ISS2 = 0x00000000    |   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0    |   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0    | user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000881ef8000    | [0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000    | Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP    | Modules linked in:    | CPU: 4 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted6.7.0-rc2-00124-g455ef3d016c9-dirty #793    | Hardware name: FVP Base RevC (DT)    | pstate: 61400009 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO +DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)    | pc : smc_chan_free+0x3c/0x6c    | lr : smc_chan_free+0x3c/0x6c    | Call trace:    |  smc_chan_free+0x3c/0x6c    |  idr_for_each+0x68/0xf8    |  scmi_cleanup_channels.isra.0+0x2c/0x58    |  scmi_probe+0x434/0x734    |  platform_probe+0x68/0xd8    |  really_probe+0x110/0x27c    |  __driver_probe_device+0x78/0x12c    |  driver_probe_device+0x3c/0x118    |  __driver_attach+0x74/0x128    |  bus_for_each_dev+0x78/0xe0    |  driver_attach+0x24/0x30    |  bus_add_driver+0xe4/0x1e8    |  driver_register+0x60/0x128    |  __platform_driver_register+0x28/0x34    |  scmi_driver_init+0x84/0xc0    |  do_one_initcall+0x78/0x33c    |  kernel_init_freeable+0x2b8/0x51c    |  kernel_init+0x24/0x130    |  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20    | Code: f0004701 910a0021 aa1403e5 97b91c70 (b9400280)    | ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---Simply check for the struct pointer being NULL before trying to accessits members, to avoid this situation.This was found when a transport doesn't really work (for instance no SMCservice), the probe routines then tries to clean up, and triggers a crash.",
