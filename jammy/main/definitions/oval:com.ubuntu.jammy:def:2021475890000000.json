		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:igbvf: fix double free in `igbvf_probe`In `igbvf_probe`, if register_netdev() fails, the program will go tolabel err_hw_init, and then to label err_ioremap. In free_netdev() whichis just below label err_ioremap, there is `list_for_each_entry_safe` and`netif_napi_del` which aims to delete all entries in `dev->napi_list`.The program has added an entry `adapter->rx_ring->napi` which is added by`netif_napi_add` in igbvf_alloc_queues(). However, adapter->rx_ring hasbeen freed below label err_hw_init. So this a UAF.In terms of how to patch the problem, we can refer to igbvf_remove() anddelete the entry before `adapter->rx_ring`.The KASAN logs are as follows:[   35.126075] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450[   35.127170] Read of size 8 at addr ffff88810126d990 by task modprobe/366[   35.128360][   35.128643] CPU: 1 PID: 366 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #14[   35.129789] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOSrel-1.12.0-59-gc9ba5276e321-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014[   35.131749] Call Trace:[   35.132199]  dump_stack_lvl+0x59/0x7b[   35.132865]  print_address_description+0x7c/0x3b0[   35.133707]  ? free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450[   35.134378]  __kasan_report+0x160/0x1c0[   35.135063]  ? free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450[   35.135738]  kasan_report+0x4b/0x70[   35.136367]  free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450[   35.137006]  igbvf_probe+0x121d/0x1a10 [igbvf][   35.137808]  ? igbvf_vlan_rx_add_vid+0x100/0x100 [igbvf][   35.138751]  local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0[   35.139461]  pci_device_probe+0x37e/0x6c0[   35.165526][   35.165806] Allocated by task 366:[   35.166414]  ____kasan_kmalloc+0xc4/0xf0[   35.167117]  foo_kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x3c/0x50 [igbvf][   35.168078]  igbvf_probe+0x9c5/0x1a10 [igbvf][   35.168866]  local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0[   35.169565]  pci_device_probe+0x37e/0x6c0[   35.179713][   35.179993] Freed by task 366:[   35.180539]  kasan_set_track+0x4c/0x80[   35.181211]  kasan_set_free_info+0x1f/0x40[   35.181942]  ____kasan_slab_free+0x103/0x140[   35.182703]  kfree+0xe3/0x250[   35.183239]  igbvf_probe+0x1173/0x1a10 [igbvf][   35.184040]  local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0",
