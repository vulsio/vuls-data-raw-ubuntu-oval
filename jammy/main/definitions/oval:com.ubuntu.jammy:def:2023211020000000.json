    "Title": "CVE-2023-21102 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
    "Description": "In __efi_rt_asm_wrapper of efi-rt-wrapper.S, there is a possible bypass of shadow stack protection due to a logic error in the code. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-260821414References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the ARM64 EFI runtime services implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly manage concurrency calls. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-21102` to fix the vulnerability.
