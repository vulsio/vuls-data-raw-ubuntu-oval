		"description": "Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of networkresources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data forreporting. From version 2.4.0 through version 2.12.4, a vulnerabilityexists that may allow privilege escalation for authenticated API users.With a read-ony user's credentials, an attacker can view most attributes ofall config objects including `ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`. This salt isenough to compute a ticket for every possible common name (CN). A ticket,the master node's certificate, and a self-signed certificate are enough tosuccessfully request the desired certificate from Icinga. That certificatemay in turn be used to steal an endpoint or API user's identity. Versions2.12.5 and 2.11.10 both contain a fix the vulnerability. As a workaround,one may either specify queryable types explicitly or filter out ApiListenerobjects.",
