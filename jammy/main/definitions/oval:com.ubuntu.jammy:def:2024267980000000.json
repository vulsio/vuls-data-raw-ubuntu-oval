		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fbcon: always restore the old font data in fbcon_do_set_font()Commit a5a923038d70 (fbdev: fbcon: Properly revert changes whenvc_resize() failed) started restoring old font data upon failure (ofvc_resize()). But it performs so only for user fonts. It means that the\"system\"/internal fonts are not restored at all. So in result, the veryfirst call to fbcon_do_set_font() performs no restore at all uponfailing vc_resize().This can be reproduced by Syzkaller to crash the system on the nextinvocation of font_get(). It's rather hard to hit the allocation failurein vc_resize() on the first font_set(), but not impossible. Esp. iffault injection is used to aid the execution/failure. It wasdemonstrated by Sirius:  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: fffffffffffffff8  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page  PGD cb7b067 P4D cb7b067 PUD cb7d067 PMD 0  Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN  CPU: 1 PID: 8007 Comm: poc Not tainted 6.7.0-g9d1694dc91ce #20  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-104/01/2014  RIP: 0010:fbcon_get_font+0x229/0x800drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:2286  Call Trace:   <TASK>   con_font_get drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:4558 [inline]   con_font_op+0x1fc/0xf20 drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:4673   vt_k_ioctl drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c:474 [inline]   vt_ioctl+0x632/0x2ec0 drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c:752   tty_ioctl+0x6f8/0x1570 drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2803   vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]  ...So restore the font data in any case, not only for user fonts.
