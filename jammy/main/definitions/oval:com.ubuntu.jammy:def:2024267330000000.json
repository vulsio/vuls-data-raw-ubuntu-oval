		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: arp:Prevent overflow in arp_req_get(). syzkaller reported an overflown write inarp_req_get(). [0] When ioctl(SIOCGARP) is issued, arp_req_get() looks upan neighbour entry and copies neigh->ha to struct arpreq.arp_ha.sa_data.The arp_ha here is struct sockaddr, not struct sockaddr_storage, so thesa_data buffer is just 14 bytes. In the splat below, 2 bytes are overflownto the next int field, arp_flags. We initialise the field just after thememcpy(), so it's not a problem. However, when dev->addr_len is greaterthan 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN), arp_netmask is overwritten, which could be setas htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL) in arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get(). Toavoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy(). Note thatcommit b5f0de6df6dc (\"net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexible array in structsockaddr\") just silenced syzkaller.
