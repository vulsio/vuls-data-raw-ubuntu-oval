The splat occurs because skb->data points pastskb->head allocated area. This is because neigh layer does: __skb_pull(skb,skb_network_offset(skb)); ... but skb_network_offset() returns a negativeoffset and __skb_pull() arg is unsigned. IOW, we skb->data gets \"adjusted\"by a huge value. The negative value is returned because skb->head andskb->data distance is more than 64k and skb->network_header (u16) haswrapped around. The bug is in the ip_tunnel infrastructure, which can causedev->needed_headroom to increment ad infinitum. The syzkaller reproducerconsists of packets getting routed via a gre tunnel, and route of greencapsulated packets pointing at another (ipip) tunnel. The ipipencapsulation finds gre0 as next output device. This results in thefollowing pattern: 1). First packet is to be sent out via gre0. Routelookup found an output device, ipip0. 2). ip_tunnel_xmit for gre0 bumpsgre0->needed_headroom based on the future output device,rt.dev->needed_headroom (ipip0). 3). ip output / start_xmit moves skb on toipip0. which runs the same code path again (xmit recursion). 4). Routingstep for the post-gre0-encap packet finds gre0 as output device to use foripip0 encapsulated packet. tunl0->needed_headroom is then incremented basedon the (already bumped) gre0 device headroom. This repeats for every futurepacket: gre0->needed_headroom gets inflated because previous packets' ipip0step incremented rt->dev (gre0) headroom, and ipip0 incremented becausegre0 needed_headroom was increased. For each subsequent packet,gre/ipip0->needed_headroom grows until post-expand-head reallocationsresult in a skb->head/data distance of more than 64k. Once that happens,skb->network_header (u16) wraps around when pskb_expand_head tries to makesure that skb_network_offset() is unchanged after the headroomexpansion/reallocation. After this skb_network_offset(skb) returns adifferent (and negative) result post headroom expansion. The next trip toneigh layer (or anything else that would __skb_pull the network header)makes skb->data point to a memory location outside skb->head area. v2: Capthe needed_headroom update to an arbitarily chosen upperlimit to preventperpetual increase instead of dropping the headroom increment completely.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26804` to fix the vulnerability.
