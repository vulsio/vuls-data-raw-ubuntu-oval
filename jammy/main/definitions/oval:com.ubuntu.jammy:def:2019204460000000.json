    "Description": "In xml.rs in GNOME librsvg before 2.46.2, a crafted SVG file with nested patterns can cause denial of service when passed to the library for processing. The attacker constructs pattern elements so that the number of final rendered objects grows exponentially.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-20446` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-rsvg-2.0 - 2.46.4-1ubuntu1\nlibrsvg2-2 - 2.46.4-1ubuntu1\nlibrsvg2-bin - 2.46.4-1ubuntu1\nlibrsvg2-common - 2.46.4-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",

Applying the patch recovered from version 2.40.21 caused a regression, as per launchpad bug 1889206, and there have been no additional commits in branch 2.40 in the last 2 years (last commit in 2020-02-26). In issue 612, upstream mentions that they will no longer provide fixes to branch 2.40. They also mention the fix to the regression, available for later versions of the code, but backporting it is not viable, as the code has been refactored and is now in an entirely different programming language. This mean there are no possible commits provided that would allow a fix for the regression in releases containing the C version of the code. Therefore, this issue will be marked as ignored for bionic and earlier."
