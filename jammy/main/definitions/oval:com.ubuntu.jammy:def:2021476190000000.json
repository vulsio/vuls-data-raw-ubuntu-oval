		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i40e:Fix queues reservation for XDP When XDP was configured on a system withlarge number of CPUs and X722 NIC there was a call trace with NULL pointerdereference. i40e 0000:87:00.0: failed to get tracking for 256 queues forVSI 0 err -12 i40e 0000:87:00.0: setup of MAIN VSI failed BUG: kernel NULLpointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000 RIP:0010:i40e_xdp+0xea/0x1b0 [i40e] Call Trace: ?i40e_reconfig_rss_queues+0x130/0x130 [i40e] dev_xdp_install+0x61/0xe0dev_xdp_attach+0x18a/0x4c0 dev_change_xdp_fd+0x1e6/0x220do_setlink+0x616/0x1030 ? ahci_port_stop+0x80/0x80 ?ata_qc_issue+0x107/0x1e0 ? lock_timer_base+0x61/0x80 ?__mod_timer+0x202/0x380 rtnl_setlink+0xe5/0x170 ?bpf_lsm_binder_transaction+0x10/0x10 ? security_capable+0x36/0x50rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x121/0x350 ? rtnl_calcit.isra.0+0x100/0x100netlink_rcv_skb+0x50/0xf0 netlink_unicast+0x1d3/0x2a0netlink_sendmsg+0x22a/0x440 sock_sendmsg+0x5e/0x60 __sys_sendto+0xf0/0x160? __sys_getsockname+0x7e/0xc0 ? _copy_from_user+0x3c/0x80 ?__sys_setsockopt+0xc8/0x1a0 __x64_sys_sendto+0x20/0x30do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae RIP:0033:0x7f83fa7a39e0 This was caused by PF queue pile fragmentation due toflow director VSI queue being placed right after main VSI. Because of thismain VSI was not able to resize its queue allocation for XDP resulting inno queues allocated for main VSI when XDP was turned on. Fix this by alwaysallocating last queue in PF queue pile for a flow director VSI.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47619` to fix the vulnerability.
