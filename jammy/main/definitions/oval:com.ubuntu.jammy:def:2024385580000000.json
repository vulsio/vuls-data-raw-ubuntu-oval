		"title": "CVE-2024-38558 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: openvswitch: fix overwriting ct original tuple for ICMPv6OVS_PACKET_CMD_EXECUTE has 3 main attributes: - OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY - Packet metadata in a netlink format. - OVS_PACKET_ATTR_PACKET - Binary packet content. - OVS_PACKET_ATTR_ACTIONS - Actions to execute on the packet.OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY is parsed first to populate sw_flow_key structurewith the metadata like conntrack state, input port, recirculation id,etc.  Then the packet itself gets parsed to populate the rest of thekeys from the packet headers.Whenever the packet parsing code starts parsing the ICMPv6 header, itfirst zeroes out fields in the key corresponding to Neighbor Discoveryinformation even if it is not an ND packet.It is an 'ipv6.nd' field.  However, the 'ipv6' is a union that sharesthe space between 'nd' and 'ct_orig' that holds the original tupleconntrack metadata parsed from the OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY.ND packets should not normally have conntrack state, so it's fine toshare the space, but normal ICMPv6 Echo packets or maybe other types ofICMPv6 can have the state attached and it should not be overwritten.The issue results in all but the last 4 bytes of the destinationaddress being wiped from the original conntrack tuple leading toincorrect packet matching and potentially executing wrong actionsin case this packet recirculates within the datapath or goes backto userspace.ND fields should not be accessed in non-ND packets, so not clearingthem should be fine.  Executing memset() only for actual ND packets toavoid the issue.Initializing the whole thing before parsing is needed because ND packetmay not contain all the options.The issue only affects the OVS_PACKET_CMD_EXECUTE path and doesn'taffect packets entering OVS datapath from network interfaces, becausein this case CT metadata is populated from skb after the packet isalready parsed.",
