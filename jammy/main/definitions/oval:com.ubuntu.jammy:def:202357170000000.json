		"Title": "CVE-2023-5717 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
		"Description": "A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If perf_read_group() is called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer. We recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06. Budimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
