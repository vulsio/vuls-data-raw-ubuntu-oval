		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Fix handling of wrong devices during bond netevent Currentimplementation of bond netevent handler only check if the handled netdev isVF representor and it missing a check if the VF representor is on the samephys device of the bond handling the netevent. Fix by adding the missingcheck and optimizing the check if the netdev is VF representor so it willnot access uninitialized private data and crashes.
