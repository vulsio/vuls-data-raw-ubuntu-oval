		"description": "It was discovered that OpenSSL clients incorrectly handled authenticating servers using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys. In certain cases, the connection will not abort as expected, possibly causing the communication to be intercepted. (CVE-2024-12797)  George Pantelakis and Alicja Kario discovered that OpenSSL had a timing side-channel when performing ECDSA signature computations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover private data. (CVE-2024-13176)  It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain memory operations when using low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial. When being used in this uncommon fashion, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-9143)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7264-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl-dev - 3.3.1-2ubuntu2.1 libssl-doc - 3.3.1-2ubuntu2.1 libssl3t64 - 3.3.1-2ubuntu2.1 openssl - 3.3.1-2ubuntu2.1 No subscription required",
