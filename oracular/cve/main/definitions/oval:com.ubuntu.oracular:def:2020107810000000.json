		"title": "CVE-2020-10781 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - low",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernelmodule, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in the/dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and is not accounted fora user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With thisvulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount ofsystem memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate andterminate random userspace processes, possibly making the systeminoperable.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10781` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required",
