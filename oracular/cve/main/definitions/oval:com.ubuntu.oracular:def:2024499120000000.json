Previously, the code assumed'stream_status' could be null, but did not handle the case where it wasactually null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference.Reported by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc_resource.c:3784planes_changed_for_existing_stream() error: we previously assumed'stream_status' could be null (see line 3774)",
