		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ceph: give up on paths longer than PATH_MAXIf the full path to be built by ceph_mdsc_build_path() happens to belonger than PATH_MAX, then this function will enter an endless (retry)loop, effectively blocking the whole task.  Most of the machinebecomes unusable, making this a very simple and effective DoSvulnerability.I cannot imagine why this retry was ever implemented, but it seemsrather useless and harmful to me.  Let's remove it and fail withENAMETOOLONG instead.",
