Depending on timing between ring stop requestcompletion, interrupt handler removal and code execution this may leadto a NULL pointer dereference in hci_dma_irq_handler() if it gets to runafter the io_data pointer is set to NULL in hci_dma_cleanup().Prevent this my masking the ring interrupts before ring stop request.",
