		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/usb: kalmia: Don't pass act_len in usb_bulk_msg error path syzbotreported that act_len in kalmia_send_init_packet() is uninitialized whenpassing it to the first usb_bulk_msg error path. Jiri Pirko noted that it'spointless to pass it in the error path, and that the value that would beprinted in the second error path would be the value of act_len from thefirst call to usb_bulk_msg.[1] With this in mind, let's just not passact_len to the usb_bulk_msg error paths. 1:https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Y9pY61y1nwTuzMOa@nanopsycho/\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52703` to fix the vulnerability.
