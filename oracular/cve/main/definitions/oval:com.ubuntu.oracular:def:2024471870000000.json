Prior to version 7.0.7,missing initialization of the random seed for \"thash\" leads to datasetshaving predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to dataset fileloading to use excessive time to load, as well as runtime performanceissues during traffic handling. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. Asa workaround, avoid loading datasets from untrusted sources. Avoid datasetrules that track traffic in rules.",
