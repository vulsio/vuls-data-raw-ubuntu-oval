		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errorsUsing WARN() for showing the error of symlink creations don't givemore information than telling that something goes wrong, since theusual code path is a lregister callback from each control elementcreation.  More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as ifit were serious issues.This patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err()instead of WARN().  For making it clearer, add the function name tothe prefix, too.",
