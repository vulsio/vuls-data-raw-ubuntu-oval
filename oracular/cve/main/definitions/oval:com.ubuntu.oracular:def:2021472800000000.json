		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm:Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique() There is atime-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due to retrievingfile_priv->master prior to locking the device's master mutex. An examplecan be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error found bySyzbot:https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This isbecause another process had acquired the device's master mutex indrm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv->master indrm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv->master was subsequently freedbefore the mutex was unlocked. To fix this, we lock the device's mastermutex before retrieving the pointer from from fpriv->master. This patchpasses the Syzbot reproducer test.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47280` to fix the vulnerability.
