		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() firstSetting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racyaccording, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called whilethe operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence ofthis behaviour.Aadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip->flags bothin tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDEDcheck inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only whenthe lock is reserved.",
