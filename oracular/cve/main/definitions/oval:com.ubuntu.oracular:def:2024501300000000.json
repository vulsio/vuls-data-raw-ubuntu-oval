		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: bpf: must hold reference on net namespaceBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x640/0x6b0Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880106fe400 by task repro/72=bpf_nf_link_release+0xda/0x1e0bpf_link_free+0x139/0x2d0bpf_link_release+0x68/0x80__fput+0x414/0xb60Eric says: It seems that bpf was able to defer the __nf_unregister_net_hook() after exit()/close() time. Perhaps a netns reference is missing, because the netns has been dismantled/freed already. bpf_nf_link_attach() does : link->net = net; But I do not see a reference being taken on net.Add such a reference and release it after hook unreg.Note that I was unable to get syzbot reproducer to work, so Ido not know if this resolves this splat.",
