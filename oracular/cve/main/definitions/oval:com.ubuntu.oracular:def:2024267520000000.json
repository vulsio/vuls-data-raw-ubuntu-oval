		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: l2tp:pass correct message length to ip6_append_data l2tp_ip6_sendmsg needs toavoid accounting for the transport header twice when splicing more datainto an already partially-occupied skbuff. To manage this, we check whetherthe skbuff contains data using skb_queue_empty when deciding how much datato append using ip6_append_data. However, the code which performed thecalculation was incorrect: ulen = len +skb_queue_empty(&sk->sk_write_queue) ? transhdrlen : 0; ...due to Coperator precedence, this ends up setting ulen to transhdrlen for messageswith a non-zero length, which results in corrupted packets on the wire. Addparentheses to correct the calculation in line with the original intent.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26752` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
