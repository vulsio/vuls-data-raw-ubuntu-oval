		"title": "CVE-2019-15793 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - medium",
		"description": "In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, several locations which shift ids translateuser/group ids before performing operations in the lower filesystem weretranslating them into init_user_ns, whereas they should have beentranslated into the s_user_ns for the lower filesystem. This resulted inusing ids other than the intended ones in the lower fs, which likely didnot map into the shifts s_user_ns. A local attacker could use this topossibly bypass discretionary access control permissions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-15793` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
