		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: clk-loongson2: Fix potential buffer overflow in flexible-array memberaccessFlexible-array member `hws` in `struct clk_hw_onecell_data` is annotatedwith the `counted_by()` attribute. This means that when memory isallocated for this array, the _counter_, which in this case is member`num` in the flexible structure, should be set to the maximum number ofelements the flexible array can contain, or fewer.In this case, the total number of elements for the flexible array isdetermined by variable `clks_num` when allocating heap space via`devm_kzalloc()`, as shown below:289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;\t...296         for (p = data; p->name; p++)297                 clks_num++;298299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws,clks_num),300                            GFP_KERNEL);So, `clp->clk_data.num` should be set to `clks_num` or less, and notexceed `clks_num`, as is currently the case. Otherwise, if data iswritten into `clp->clk_data.hws[clks_num]`, the instrumentationprovided by the compiler won't detect the overflow, leading to amemory corruption bug at runtime.Fix this issue by setting `clp->clk_data.num` to `clks_num`.",
