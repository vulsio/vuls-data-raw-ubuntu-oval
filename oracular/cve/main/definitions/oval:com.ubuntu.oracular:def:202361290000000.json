		"description": "Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state ofapplications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU providesvector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whetherthe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might becorrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC(message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUsrestores the contents of vector registers in a different order than theyare saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers arecorrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only onnewer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. Theconsequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can bevarious - from no consequences, if the calling application does not dependon the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of theapplication process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registersfor storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be anincorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crashleading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is mostfrequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticatedencryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of thisAEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher isenabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEADcipher is used. This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL canbe potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concreteapplication that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider thisa Low severity security issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-6129` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3t64 - 3.0.10-1ubuntu4\nopenssl - 3.0.10-1ubuntu4\nNo subscription required",
