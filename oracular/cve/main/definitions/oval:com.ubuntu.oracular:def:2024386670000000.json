		"title": "CVE-2024-38667 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: riscv:prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads Top of the kernelthread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. However this is not the casefor the idle threads of the secondary boot harts. Their stacks overlap withtheir pt_regs, so both may get corrupted. Similar issue has been fixed forthe primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28 (\"riscv: prevent stack corruption byreserving task_pt_regs(p) early\"). However that fix was not propagated tothe secondary harts. The problem has been noticed in some CPU hotplug testswith V enabled. The function smp_callin stored several registers on stack,corrupting top of pt_regs structure including status field. As a result,kernel attempted to save or restore inexistent V context.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38667` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic-64k - 6.11.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-aws - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1003-azure - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1001-gcp - 6.11.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.11.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle - 6.11.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.11.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-1003-raspi - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
