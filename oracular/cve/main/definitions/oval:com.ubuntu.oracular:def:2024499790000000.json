		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: gso: fix tcp fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_listDetect tcp gso fraglist skbs with corrupted geometry (see below) andpass these to skb_segment instead of skb_segment_list, as the firstcan segment them correctly.Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs- consist of two or more segments- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment- all but the last must be gso_sizeOptional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) canmodify these skbs, breaking these invariants.In extreme cases they pull all data into skb linear. For TCP, thiscauses a NULL ptr deref in __tcpv4_gso_segment_list_csum attcp_hdr(seg->next).Detect invalid geometry due to pull, by checking head_skb size.Don't just drop, as this may blackhole a destination. Convert to beable to pass to regular skb_segment.Approach and description based on a patch by Willem de Bruijn.",
