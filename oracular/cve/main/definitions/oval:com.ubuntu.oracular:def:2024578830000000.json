		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: hugetlb: independent PMD page table shared countThe folio refcount may be increased unexpectly through try_get_folio() bycaller such as split_huge_pages.  In huge_pmd_unshare(), we use refcountto check whether a pmd page table is shared.  The check is incorrect ifthe refcount is increased by the above caller, and this can cause the pagetable leaked: BUG: Bad page state in process sh  pfn:109324 page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x66pfn:0x109324 flags: 0x17ffff800000000(node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0xfffff) page_type: f2(table) raw: 017ffff800000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 raw: 0000000000000066 0000000000000000 00000000f2000000 0000000000000000 page dumped because: nonzero mapcount ...

The page table itself will be discarded after reporting the   \"nonzero mapcount\".2. The HugeTLB page mapped by the page table miss freeing since we   treat the page table as shared and a shared page table will not be   unmapped.Fix it by introducing independent PMD page table shared count.  Asdescribed by comment, pt_index/pt_mm/pt_frag_refcount are used for s390gmap, x86 pgds and powerpc, pt_share_count is used for x86/arm64/riscvpmds, so we can reuse the field as pt_share_count.",
