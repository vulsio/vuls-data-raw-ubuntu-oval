		"description": "Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privilegedapplication user to view or change different rows from those intended.  Anattack requires the application to use SET ROLE, SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION,or an equivalent feature.  The problem arises when an application queryuses parameters from the attacker or conveys query results to the attacker. If that query reacts to current_setting('role') or the current user ID, itmay modify or return data as though the session had not used SET ROLE orSET SESSION AUTHORIZATION.  The attacker does not control which incorrectuser ID applies.  Query text from less-privileged sources is not a concernhere, because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not sandboxes forunvetted queries.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14,13.17, and 12.21 are affected.",
