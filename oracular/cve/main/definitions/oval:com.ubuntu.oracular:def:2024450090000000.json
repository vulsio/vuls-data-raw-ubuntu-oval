		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ reqAdding the following warning ...  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.add_addr_accepted == 0)... before decrementing the add_addr_accepted counter helped to find abug when running the \"remove single subflow\" subtest from themptcp_join.sh selftest.Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then thesubflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of theRM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement thisadd_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows havenot been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attachedsubflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated bythe host receiving the RM_ADDR.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45009` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic-64k - 6.11.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-aws - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1003-azure - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1001-gcp - 6.11.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.11.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle - 6.11.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.11.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-1003-raspi - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
