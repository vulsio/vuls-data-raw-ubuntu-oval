		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched: fix warning in sched_setaffinityCommit 8f9ea86fdf99b added some logic to sched_setaffinity that includeda WARN when a per-task affinity assignment races with a cpuset update.Specifically, we can have a race where a cpuset update results in thetask affinity no longer being a subset of the cpuset. That's fine; wehave a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARNset up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all withthe requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; itstrivial to create this condition.Reproduced the warning by the following setup:- $PID inside a cpuset cgroup- another thread repeatedly switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1- another thread repeatedly setting the $PID affinity (via taskset) to 2",
