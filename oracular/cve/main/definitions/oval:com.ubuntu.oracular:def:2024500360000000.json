		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()dst_entries_add() uses per-cpu data that might be freed at netnsdismantle from ip6_route_net_exit() calling dst_entries_destroy()Before ip6_route_net_exit() can be called, we release allthe dsts associated with this netns, via calls to dst_release(),which waits an rcu grace period before calling dst_destroy()dst_entries_add() use in dst_destroy() is racy, becausedst_entries_destroy() could have been called already.Decrementing the number of dsts must happen sooner.Notes:1) in CONFIG_XFRM case, dst_destroy() can call   dst_release_immediate(child), this might also cause UAF   if the child does not have DST_NOCOUNT set.   IPSEC maintainers might take a look and see how to address this.2) There is also discussion about removing this count of dst,   which might happen in future kernels.",
