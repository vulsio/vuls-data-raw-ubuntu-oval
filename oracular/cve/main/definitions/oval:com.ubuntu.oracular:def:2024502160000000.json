		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xfs: fix finding a last resort AG in xfs_filestream_pick_agWhen the main loop in xfs_filestream_pick_ag fails to find a suitableAG it tries to just pick the online AG.  But the loop for that usesargs->pag as loop iterator while the later code expects pag to beset.  Fix this by reusing the max_pag case for this last resort, andalso add a check for impossible case of no AG just to make sure thatthe uninitialized pag doesn't even escape in theory.",
