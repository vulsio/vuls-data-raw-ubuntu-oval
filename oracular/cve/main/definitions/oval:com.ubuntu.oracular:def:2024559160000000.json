		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Drivers: hv: util: Avoid accessing a ringbuffer not initialized yetIf the KVP (or VSS) daemon starts before the VMBus channel's ringbuffer isfully initialized, we can hit the panic below:hv_utils: Registering HyperV Utility Driverhv_vmbus: registering driver hv_utils...BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000CPU: 44 UID: 0 PID: 2552 Comm: hv_kvp_daemon Tainted: G E 6.11.0-rc3+ #1RIP: 0010:hv_pkt_iter_first+0x12/0xd0Call Trace:... vmbus_recvpacket hv_kvp_onchannelcallback vmbus_on_event tasklet_action_common tasklet_action handle_softirqs irq_exit_rcu sysvec_hyperv_stimer0 </IRQ> <TASK> asm_sysvec_hyperv_stimer0... kvp_register_done hvt_op_read vfs_read ksys_read __x64_sys_readThis can happen because the KVP/VSS channel callback can be invokedeven before the channel is fully opened:1) as soon as hv_kvp_init() -> hvutil_transport_init() creates/dev/vmbus/hv_kvp, the kvp daemon can open the device file immediately andregister itself to the driver by writing a message KVP_OP_REGISTER1 to thefile (which is handled by kvp_on_msg() ->kvp_handle_handshake()) andreading the file for the driver's response, which is handled byhvt_op_read(), which calls hvt->on_read(), i.e. kvp_register_done().2) the problem with kvp_register_done() is that it can cause thechannel callback to be called even before the channel is fully opened,and when the channel callback is starting to run, util_probe()->vmbus_open() may have not initialized the ringbuffer yet, so thecallback can hit the panic of NULL pointer dereference.To reproduce the panic consistently, we can add a \"ssleep(10)\" for KVP in__vmbus_open(), just before the first hv_ringbuffer_init(), and then weunload and reload the driver hv_utils, and run the daemon manually withinthe 10 seconds.Fix the panic by reordering the steps in util_probe() so the char deventry used by the KVP or VSS daemon is not created until aftervmbus_open() has completed. This reordering prevents the race conditionfrom happening.",
