		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix potential oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()The function nilfs_btree_check_delete(), which checks whether degenerationto direct mapping occurs before deleting a b-tree entry, causes memoryaccess outside the block buffer when retrieving the maximum key if theroot node has no entries.This does not usually happen because b-tree mappings with 0 child nodesare never created by mkfs.nilfs2 or nilfs2 itself.  However, it can happenif the b-tree root node read from a device is configured that way, so fixthis potential issue by adding a check for that case.",
