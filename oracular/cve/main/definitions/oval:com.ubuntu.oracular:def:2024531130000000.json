		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: fix NULL pointer dereference in alloc_pages_bulk_noprofWe triggered a NULL pointer dereference for ac.preferred_zoneref->zone inalloc_pages_bulk_noprof() when the task is migrated between cpusets.When cpuset is enabled, in prepare_alloc_pages(), ac->nodemask may be&current->mems_allowed.  when first_zones_zonelist() is called to findpreferred_zoneref, the ac->nodemask may be modified concurrently if thetask is migrated between different cpusets.  Assuming we have 2 NUMA Node,when traversing Node1 in ac->zonelist, the nodemask is 2, and whentraversing Node2 in ac->zonelist, the nodemask is 1.  As a result, theac->preferred_zoneref points to NULL zone.In alloc_pages_bulk_noprof(), for_each_zone_zonelist_nodemask() finds aallowable zone and calls zonelist_node_idx(ac.preferred_zoneref), leadingto NULL pointer dereference.__alloc_pages_noprof() fixes this issue by checking NULL pointer in commitea57485af8f4 (\"mm, page_alloc: fix check for NULL preferred_zone\") andcommit df76cee6bbeb (\"mm, page_alloc: remove redundant checks from allocfastpath\").To fix it, check NULL pointer for preferred_zoneref->zone.",
