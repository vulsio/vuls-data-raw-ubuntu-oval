		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sfc: Don't invoke xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.Yury reported a crash in the sfc driver originated fromnetpoll_send_udp(). The netconsole sends a message and then netpollinvokes the driver's NAPI function with a budget of zero. It isdedicated to allow driver to free TX resources, that it may have usedwhile sending the packet.In the netpoll case the driver invokes xdp_do_flush() unconditionally,leading to crash because bpf_net_context was never assigned.Invoke xdp_do_flush() only if budget is not zero.",
