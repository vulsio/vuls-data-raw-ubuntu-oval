		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean upCurrently, during link deletion, the link ID is first removed from thevalid_links bitmap before performing any clean-up operations. However, somefunctions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. Onesuch example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -nl80211_remove_link()    cfg80211_remove_link()        ieee80211_del_intf_link()            ieee80211_vif_set_links()                ieee80211_vif_update_links()                    ieee80211_link_stop()                        cfg80211_cac_event()cfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is clearedalready in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.Therefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the linkclean-up.",
