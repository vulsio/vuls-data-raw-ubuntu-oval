		"title": "CVE-2021-26931 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - low",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as usedin Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug,deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at leastunder the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn'tcorrect to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing suchcrashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affectsdrivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-26931` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required",
