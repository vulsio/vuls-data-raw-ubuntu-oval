		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/sgx: Fix deadlock in SGX NUMA node searchWhen the current node doesn't have an EPC section configured by firmwareand all other EPC sections are used up, CPU can get stuck inside thewhile loop that looks for an available EPC page from remote nodesindefinitely, leading to a soft lockup. Note how nid_of_current willnever be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is notset in sgx_numa_mask.Also worth mentioning is that it's perfectly fine for the firmware notto setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section oneach node can enhance performance, it is not a requirement forfunctionality.Rework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory. Thisavoids the deadlock looking for the current SGX-lacking node to show upin the loop when it never will.",
