		"title": "CVE-2022-46175 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - medium",
		"description": "JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to beeasier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The `parse`method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing speciallycrafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. Thisvulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by`JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonlyunderstood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting theprototype of a single object can have significant security impact for anapplication if the object is later used in trusted operations. Thisvulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keyson the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend onhow applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwantedkeys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevationof privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse`should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings toobjects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included inJavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to`JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. Thisvulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-46175` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-json5 - 2.2.3+dfsg-1build1\nNo subscription required",
