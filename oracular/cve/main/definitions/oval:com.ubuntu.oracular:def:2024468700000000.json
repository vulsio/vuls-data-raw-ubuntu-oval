		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35[Why]DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - whichworks fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a racecondition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or registeraccesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefinedstate.[How]We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, butfor now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this racecondition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels therisk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdogtimeout are minimal.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46870` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic-64k - 6.11.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-aws - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1003-azure - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1001-gcp - 6.11.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.11.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle - 6.11.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.11.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-1003-raspi - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
