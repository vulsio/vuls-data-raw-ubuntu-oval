		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user buffer BothIntel and AMD consider it to be architecturally valid for XRSTOR to failwith #PF but nonetheless change the register state. The actual conditionsunder which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seems plausible thatthis might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a page and invalidatesthe shared TLB while another sibling thread is executing XRSTOR on the pagein question. __fpu__restore_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardwareregisters are preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using thefpu_fpregs_owner_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail butmodify the registers. If this happens, then there is a window in which__fpu__restore_sig() could schedule out and the victim task could scheduleback in without reloading its own FPU registers. This would result in partof the FPU state that __fpu__restore_sig() was attempting to load leakinginto the victim task's user-visible state. Invalidate preserved FPUregisters on XRSTOR failure to prevent this situation from corrupting anystate. [1] Frequent readers of the errata lists might imagine \"complexmicroarchitectural conditions\".\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47226` to fix the vulnerability.
