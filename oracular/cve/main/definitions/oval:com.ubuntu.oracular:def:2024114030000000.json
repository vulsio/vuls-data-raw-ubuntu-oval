		"description": "There exists an out of bounds read/write in LibJXL versions prior tocommit 9cc451b91b74ba470fd72bd48c121e9f33d24c99. The JPEG decoder used bythe JPEG XL encoder when doing JPEG recompression (i.e. if usingJxlEncoderAddJPEGFrame on untrusted input) does not properly check boundsin the presence of incomplete codes. This could lead to an out-of-boundswrite. In jpegli which is released as part of the same project, the samevulnerability is present. However, the relevant buffer is part of a biggerstructure, and the code makes no assumptions on the values that could beoverwritten. The issue could however cause jpegli to read uninitialisedmemory, or addresses of functions.",
