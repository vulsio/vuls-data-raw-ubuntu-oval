		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation The patch\"netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy and kernel sideadd/del/test\", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition. But thesynchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows it down:it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead. Eric Dumazetpointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as rcu callback doesnot work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors which need cancelling atdestroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy functions are split into two:cancelling garbage collectors safely at executing the command received bynetlink and moving the remaining part only into the rcu callback.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26910` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
