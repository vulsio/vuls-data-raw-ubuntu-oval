		"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handlingcomponents. An Use-After-Free read vulnerability has been discoveredaffecting the processing of CodecPrivate elements in Matroska streams. Inthe GST_MATROSKA_ID_CODECPRIVATE case within thegst_matroska_demux_parse_stream function, a data chunk is allocated usinggst_ebml_read_binary. Later, the allocated memory is freed in thegst_matroska_track_free function, by the call to g_free(track->codec_priv). Finally, the freed memory is accessed in thecaps_serialize function through gst_value_serialize_buffer. The freedmemory will be accessed in the gst_value_serialize_buffer function. Thisresults in a UAF read vulnerability, as the function tries to processmemory that has already been freed. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47834` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngstreamer1.0-gtk3 - 1.24.8-1ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-good - 1.24.8-1ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-pulseaudio - 1.24.8-1ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-qt5 - 1.24.8-1ubuntu1.1\ngstreamer1.0-qt6 - 1.24.8-1ubuntu1.1\nlibgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-0 - 1.24.8-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
