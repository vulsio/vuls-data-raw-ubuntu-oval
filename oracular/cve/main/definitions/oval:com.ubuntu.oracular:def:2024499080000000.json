Previously, 'afb' was assumed to benull at line 8388, but was used later in the code without a null check.This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.Changes since v1:- Moved the null check for 'afb' to the line where 'afb' is used. (Alex)Fixes the below:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c:8433amdgpu_dm_update_cursor()\terror: we previously assumed 'afb' could be null (see line 8388)",
