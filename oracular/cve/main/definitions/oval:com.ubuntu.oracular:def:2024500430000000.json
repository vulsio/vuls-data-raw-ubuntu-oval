		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix possible badness in FREE_STATEIDWhen multiple FREE_STATEIDs are sent for the same delegation stateid,it can lead to a possible either use-after-free or counter refcountunderflow errors.In nfsd4_free_stateid() under the client lock we find a delegationstateid, however the code drops the lock before calling nfs4_put_stid(),that allows another FREE_STATE to find the stateid again. The first onewill proceed to then free the stateid which leads to eitheruse-after-free or decrementing already zeroed counter.",
