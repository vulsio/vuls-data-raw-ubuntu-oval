		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transferWhen a process' cred struct is replaced, this _almost_ always invokesthe cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (whenKEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT updates the parent's credentials), thecred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock only implements thecred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causesall information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.This basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork()and keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions onitself.Fix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as theexisting cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare()call hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely toaccidentally diverge in the future.)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42318` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic-64k - 6.11.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-aws - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1003-azure - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1001-gcp - 6.11.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.11.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle - 6.11.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.11.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-1003-raspi - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
