		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handleit inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.__octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. Ifskb allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: weshouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to theoctep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is noassociated skb in this case, don't process the packets and don't push themup the network stack - they are skipped.Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffersused by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented tomark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
