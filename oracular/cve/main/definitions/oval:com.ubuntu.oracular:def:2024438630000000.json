		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence pollingIntroduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't removethe fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock tofix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of allfences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to preventthe list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callbackboth deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pendingfences, for which it holds a lock.dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the pollcalls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences listwhich it can never get because it's held by the wait from which itwas called.Old bug, but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf pollinginterfaces. Fix those, in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43863` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic-64k - 6.11.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-aws - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1003-azure - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1001-gcp - 6.11.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.11.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle - 6.11.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.11.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-1003-raspi - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
