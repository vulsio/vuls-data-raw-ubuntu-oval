		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplaceThere is a potential infinite loop issue that can occur when using acombination of tail calls and freplace.In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace oftailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call inentry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets tozero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanismto never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.To fix this issue, the solution is twofold:1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a   prog_array map.2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map   with an freplace program.This ensures that:* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to aprog_array map.Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with atab for proper formatting.",
