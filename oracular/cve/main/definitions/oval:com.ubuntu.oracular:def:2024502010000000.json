		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/radeon: Fix encoder->possible_clonesInclude the encoder itself in its possible_clones bitmask.In the past nothing validated that drivers were populatingpossible_clones correctly, but that changed in commit74d2aacbe840 (\"drm: Validate encoder->possible_clones\").Looks like radeon never got the memo and is still notfollowing the rules 100% correctly.This results in some warnings during driver initialization:Bogus possible_clones: [ENCODER:46:TV-46] possible_clones=0x4 (full encodermask=0x7)WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 170 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_mode_config.c:615drm_mode_config_validate+0x113/0x39c...(cherry picked from commit 3b6e7d40649c0d75572039aff9d0911864c689db)",
