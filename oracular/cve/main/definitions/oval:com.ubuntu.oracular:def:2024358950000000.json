		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf,sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem syzkallerstarted using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes elements from asockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be invoked from anyinterrupt context, locks taken during a map_delete_elem operation must behardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion is possible, asreported by lockdep: CPU0 CPU1 ---- ---- lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);local_irq_disable(); lock(&host->lock); lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);<Interrupt> lock(&host->lock); Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe bydesign. We expects elements to be deleted from sockmap/sockhash only intask (normal) context with interrupts enabled, or in softirq context.Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is_not_ hardirq-unsafe, that is interrupts are disabled, and bail out with anerror. Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifierdoes not allow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.",
