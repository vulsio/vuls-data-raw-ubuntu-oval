		"description": "A flaw was found in rsync. It could allow a server to enumerate thecontents of an arbitrary file from the client's machine. This issue occurswhen files are being copied from a client to a server. During this process,the rsync server will send checksums of local data to the client to comparewith in order to determine what data needs to be sent to the server. Bysending specially constructed checksum values for arbitrary files, anattacker may be able to reconstruct the data of those files byte-by-bytebased on the responses from the client.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-12086` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrsync - 3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
