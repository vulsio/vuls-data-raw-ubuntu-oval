		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mptcp: pm: only mark 'subflow' endp as availableAdding the following warning ...  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.local_addr_used == 0)... before decrementing the local_addr_used counter helped to find a bugwhen running the \"remove single address\" subtest from the mptcp_join.shselftests.Removing a 'signal' endpoint will trigger the removal of all subflowslinked to this endpoint via mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow() withrm_type == MPTCP_MIB_RMSUBFLOW. This will decrement the local_addr_usedcounter, which is wrong in this case because this counter is linked to'subflow' endpoints, and here it is a 'signal' endpoint that is beingremoved.Now, the counter is decremented, only if the ID is being used outsideof mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow(), only for 'subflow' endpoints, andif the ID is not 0 -- local_addr_used is not taking into account theseones. This marking of the ID as being available, and the decrement isdone no matter if a subflow using this ID is currently available,because the subflow could have been closed before.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45010` to fix the vulnerability.
