		"title": "CVE-2024-56755 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATINGIn fscache_create_volume(), there is a missing memory barrier between thebit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause asituation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't beendetected yet, leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is asfollows:  [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work]fscache_perform_lookup  fscache_create_volume                        fscache_perform_lookup                          fscache_create_volume\t\t\t                        fscache_create_volume_work                                                  cachefiles_acquire_volume                                                  clear_and_wake_up_bit    test_and_set_bit                            test_and_set_bit                              goto maybe_wait      goto no_waitIn the above process, cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1enters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waitingprocess. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the-wait- process indefinitely.In commit 3288666c7256 (\"fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() infscache_create_volume_work()\"), barriers were added to similar operationsin fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() tofix this issue.",
