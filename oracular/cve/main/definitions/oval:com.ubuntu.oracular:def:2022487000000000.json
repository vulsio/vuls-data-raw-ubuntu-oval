		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/type1: Unpin zero pages There's currently a reference count leak onthe zero page. We increment the reference via pin_user_pages_remote(), butthe page is later handled as an invalid/reserved page, therefore it's notaccounted against the user and not unpinned by our put_pfn(). Introducingspecial zero page handling in put_pfn() would resolve the leak, but withoutaccounting of the zero page, a single user could still create enoughmappings to generate a reference count overflow. The zero page is alwaysresident, so for our purposes there's no reason to keep it pinned.Therefore, add a loop to walk pages returned from pin_user_pages_remote()and unpin any zero pages.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48700` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
