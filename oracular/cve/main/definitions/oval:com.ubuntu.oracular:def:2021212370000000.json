		"description": "Git LFS is a command line extension for managing large files with Git. OnWindows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat orgit.exe file in the current directory, that program would be executed,permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affectUnix systems. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955.This issue occurs because on Windows, Go includes (and prefers) the currentdirectory when the name of a command run does not contain a directoryseparator. Other than avoiding untrusted repositories or using a differentoperating system, there is no workaround. This is fixed in v2.13.2.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21237` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngit-lfs - 2.13.2-1\nNo subscription required",
