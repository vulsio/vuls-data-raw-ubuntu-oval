Interactionwith this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attackvectors may vary depending on the implementation. The specific flaw existswithin the parsing of tile list data within AV1-encoded video files. Theissue results from the lack of proper validation of the length ofuser-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-basedbuffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in thecontext of the current process.
