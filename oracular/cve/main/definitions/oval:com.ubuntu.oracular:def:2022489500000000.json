		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf: Fix perf_pending_task() UaFPer syzbot it is possible for perf_pending_task() to run after theevent is free()'d. There are two related but distinct cases: - the task_work was already queued before destroying the event; - destroying the event itself queues the task_work.The first cannot be solved using task_work_cancel() sinceperf_release() itself might be called from a task_work (____fput),which means the current->task_works list is already empty andtask_work_cancel() won't be able to find the perf_pending_task()entry.The simplest alternative is extending the perf_event lifetime to coverthe task_work.The second is just silly, queueing a task_work while you know theevent is going away makes no sense and is easily avoided byre-arranging how the event is marked STATE_DEAD and ensuring it goesthrough STATE_OFF on the way down.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48950` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
