		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:block: release rq qos structures for queue without diskblkcg_init_queue() may add rq qos structures to request queue, previouslyblk_cleanup_queue() calls rq_qos_exit() to release them, but commit8e141f9eb803 (\"block: drain file system I/O on del_gendisk\")moves rq_qos_exit() into del_gendisk(), so memory leak is causedbecause queues may not have disk, such as un-present scsi luns, nvmeadmin queue, ...Fixes the issue by adding rq_qos_exit() to blk_cleanup_queue() back.BTW, v5.18 won't need this patch any more since we moveblkcg_init_queue()/blkcg_exit_queue() into disk allocation/releasehandler, and patches have been in for-5.18/block.",
