		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: don't access invalid schedSince 2320c9e6a768 (\"drm/sched: memset() 'job' in drm_sched_job_init()\")accessing job->base.sched can produce unexpected results as theinitialisationof (*job)->base.sched done in amdgpu_job_alloc is overwritten by thememset.This commit fixes an issue when a CS would fail validation and wouldbe rejected after job->num_ibs is incremented. In this case,amdgpu_ib_free(ring->adev, ...) will be called, which would crash themachine because the ring value is bogus.To fix this, pass a NULL pointer to amdgpu_ib_free(): we can do thisbecause the device is actually not used in this function.The next commit will remove the ring argument completely.(cherry picked from commit 2ae520cb12831d264ceb97c61f72c59d33c0dbd7)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46896` to fix the vulnerability.
