		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:Fix null dereference on suspend A race condition exists where a synchronous(noqueue) transfer can be active during a system suspend. This can cause anull pointer dereference exception to occur when the system resumes.Example order of events leading to the exception: 1. spi_sync() calls__spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets ctlr->cur_msg 2. Spi transferbegins via spi_transfer_one_message() 3. System is suspended interruptingthe transfer context 4. System is resumed 6. spi_controller_resume() callsspi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg to NULL 7. Spi transfer contextresumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is called which dereferencescur_msg (which is now NULL) Wait for synchronous transfers to completebefore suspending by acquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspendflag.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52749` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
