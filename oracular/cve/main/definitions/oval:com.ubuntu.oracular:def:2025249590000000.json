		"description": "zx is a tool for writing better scripts. An attacker with control overenvironment variable values can inject unintended environment variablesinto `process.env`. This can lead to arbitrary command execution orunexpected behavior in applications that rely on environment variables forsecurity-sensitive operations. Applications that process untrusted inputand pass it through `dotenv.stringify` are particularly vulnerable. Thisissue has been patched in version 8.3.2. Users should immediately upgradeto this version to mitigate the vulnerability. If upgrading is notfeasible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by sanitizinguser-controlled environment variable values before passing them to`dotenv.stringify`. Specifically, avoid using `\"`, `'`, and backticks invalues, or enforce strict validation of environment variables before usage.",
