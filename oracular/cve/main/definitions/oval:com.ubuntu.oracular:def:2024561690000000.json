		"description": "A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before2.0.0. RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain abackup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback incase a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the productcurrently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (becausefetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yieldsincorrect files, there is no viable fallback. This leads to incompleteroute origin validation data.",
