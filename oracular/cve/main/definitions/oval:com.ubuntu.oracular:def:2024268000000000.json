		"title": "CVE-2024-26800 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls:fix use-after-free on failed backlog decryption When the decrypt requestgoes to the backlog and crypto_aead_decrypt returns -EBUSY,tls_do_decryption will wait until all async decryptions have completed. Ifone of them fails, tls_do_decryption will return -EBADMSG andtls_decrypt_sg jumps to the error path, releasing all the pages. But thepages have been passed to the async callback, and have already beenreleased by tls_decrypt_done. The only true async case is whencrypto_aead_decrypt returns -EINPROGRESS. With -EBUSY, we already waited sowe can tell tls_sw_recvmsg that the data is available for immediate copy,but we need to notify tls_decrypt_sg (via the new ->async_done flag) thatthe memory has already been released.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26800` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
