		"description": "lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may allowlocal users to infer whether any file exists, even within a protecteddirectory tree, because \"Failed to open\" often indicates that a file doesnot exist, whereas \"does not refer to a network namespace path\" oftenindicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that \"we willreport back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way ofknowing why it failed\"; however, in many realistic cases, there are noplausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-47952` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblxc-common - 1:5.0.3-2ubuntu7\nliblxc1t64 - 1:5.0.3-2ubuntu7\nlibpam-cgfs - 1:5.0.3-2ubuntu7\nlxc - 1:5.0.3-2ubuntu7\nlxc-tests - 1:5.0.3-2ubuntu7\nlxc-utils - 1:5.0.3-2ubuntu7\nlxc1 - 1:5.0.3-2ubuntu7\nNo subscription required",
