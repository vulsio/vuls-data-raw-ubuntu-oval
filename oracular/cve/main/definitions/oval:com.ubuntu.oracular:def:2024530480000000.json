		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: fix crash on probe for DPLL enabled E810 LOMThe E810 Lan On Motherboard (LOM) design is vendor specific. Intelprovides the reference design, but it is up to vendor on the finalproduct design. For some cases, like Linux DPLL support, the staticvalues defined in the driver does not reflect the actual LOM design.Current implementation of dpll pins is causing the crash on probeof the ice driver for such DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs:WARNING: (...) at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:495 dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330...Call Trace: <TASK> ? __warn+0x83/0x130 ? dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330 ? report_bug+0x1b7/0x1d0 ? handle_bug+0x42/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 ? dpll_pin_get+0x117/0x330 ? dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330 ? dpll_pin_get+0x117/0x330 ice_dpll_get_pins.isra.0+0x52/0xe0 [ice]...The number of dpll pins enabled by LOM vendor is greater than expectedand defined in the driver for Intel designed NICs, which causes the crash.Prevent the crash and allow generic pin initialization within Linux DPLLsubsystem for DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs.Newly designed solution for described issue will be based on \"per HWdesign\" pin initialization. It requires pin information dynamicallyacquired from the firmware and is already in progress, planned fornext-tree only.",
