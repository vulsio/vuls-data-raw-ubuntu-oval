		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:libbpf: Handle size overflow for ringbuf mmapThe maximum size of ringbuf is 2GB on x86-64 host, so 2 * max_entrieswill overflow u32 when mapping producer page and data pages. Onlycasting max_entries to size_t is not enough, because for 32-bitsapplication on 64-bits kernel the size of read-only mmap regionalso could overflow size_t.So fixing it by casting the size of read-only mmap region into a __u64and checking whether or not there will be overflow during mmap.",
