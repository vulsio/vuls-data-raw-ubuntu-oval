		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: phy:ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered Thepower_supply frame-work is not really designed for there to be long livingin kernel references to power_supply devices. Specifically unregistering apower_supply while some other code has a reference to it triggers a WARN inpower_supply_unregister(): WARN_ON(atomic_dec_return(&psy->use_cnt));Folllowed by the power_supply still getting removed and the backing datafreed anyway, leaving the tusb1210 charger-detect code with a danglingreference, resulting in a crash the next time tusb1210_get_online() iscalled. Fix this by only holding the reference in tusb1210_get_online()freeing it at the end of the function. Note this still leaves a theoreticalrace window, but it avoids the issue when manually rmmod-ing the chargerchip driver during development.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35986` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic - 6.11.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-7-generic-64k - 6.11.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-aws - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1003-azure - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1001-gcp - 6.11.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.11.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.11.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle - 6.11.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.11.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.11.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.11.0-1003-raspi - 6.11.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
