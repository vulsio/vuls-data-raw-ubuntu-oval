		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: mana: Fix race on per-CQ variable napi work_doneAfter calling napi_complete_done(), the NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit may becleared, and another CPU can start napi thread and access per-CQ variable,cq->work_done. If the other thread (for example, from busy_poll) setsit to a value >= budget, this thread will continue to run when it shouldstop, and cause memory corruption and panic.To fix this issue, save the per-CQ work_done variable in a local variablebefore napi_complete_done(), so it won't be corrupted by a possibleconcurrent thread after napi_complete_done().Also, add a flag bit to advertise to the NIC firmware: the NAPI work_donevariable race is fixed, so the driver is able to reliably support featureslike busy_poll.",
