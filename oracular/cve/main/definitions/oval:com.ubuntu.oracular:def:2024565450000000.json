Normally, devres_open_group() is called from__hid_device_probe() but Hyper-V HID driver overrides 'hid_dev->driver'with 'mousevsc_hid_driver' stub and basically re-implements__hid_device_probe() by calling hid_parse() and hid_hw_start() but notdevres_open_group(). hid_device_probe() does not call __hid_device_probe()for it. Later, when the driver is removed, hid_device_remove() callsdevres_release_group() as it doesn't check whether hdev->driver wasinitially overridden or not.The issue seems to be related to the commit 62c68e7cee33 (\"HID: ensuretimely release of driver-allocated resources\") but the commit itself seemsto be correct.Fix the issue by dropping the 'hid_dev->driver' override and usinghid_register_driver()/hid_unregister_driver() instead. Alternatively, itwould have been possible to rely on the default handling butHID_CONNECT_DEFAULT implies HID_CONNECT_HIDRAW and it doesn't seem to workfor mousevsc as-is.",
