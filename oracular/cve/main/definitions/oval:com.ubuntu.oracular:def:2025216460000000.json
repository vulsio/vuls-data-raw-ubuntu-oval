		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:afs: Fix the maximum cell name lengthThe kafs filesystem limits the maximum length of a cell to 256 bytes, but aproblem occurs if someone actually does that: kafs tries to create adirectory under /proc/net/afs/ with the name of the cell, but that failswith a warning:        WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at fs/proc/generic.c:405because procfs limits the maximum filename length to 255.However, the DNS limits the maximum lookup length and, by extension, themaximum cell name, to 255 less two (length count and trailing NUL).Fix this by limiting the maximum acceptable cellname length to 253.  Thisalso allows us to be sure we can create the \"/afs/.<cell>/\" mountpoint too.Further, split the YFS VL record cell name maximum to be the 256 allowed bythe protocol and ignore the record retrieved by YFSVL.GetCellName if itexceeds 253.",
