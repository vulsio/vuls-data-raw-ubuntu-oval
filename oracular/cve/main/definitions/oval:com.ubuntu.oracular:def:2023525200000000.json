		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix reference leak If a duplicate attribute isfound using kset_find_obj(), a reference to that attribute is returnedwhich needs to be disposed accordingly using kobject_put(). Move thesetting name validation into a separate function to allow for this changewithout having to duplicate the cleanup code for this setting. As a sidenote, a very similar bug was fixed in commit 7295a996fdab (\"platform/x86:dell-sysman: Fix reference leak\"), so it seems that the bug was copied fromthat driver. Compile-tested only.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52520` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
