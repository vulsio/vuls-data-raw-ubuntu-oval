		"description": "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior toversions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3, undici uses `Math.random()` to choosethe boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the outputof `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values areknown. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests toan attacker-controlled website, they can use this to leak the necessaryvalues. Therefore, an attacker can tamper with the requests going to thebackend APIs if certain conditions are met. This is fixed in versions5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3. As a workaround, do not issue multipart requeststo attacker controlled servers.",
