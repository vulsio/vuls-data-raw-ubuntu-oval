		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nommu: pass NULL argument to vma_iter_prealloc()When deleting a vma entry from a maple tree, it has to pass NULL tovma_iter_prealloc() in order to calculate internal state of the tree, butit passed a wrong argument.  As a result, nommu kernels crashed uponaccessing a vma iterator, such as acct_collect() reading the size of vmaentries after do_munmap().This commit fixes this issue by passing a right argument to thepreallocation call.",
