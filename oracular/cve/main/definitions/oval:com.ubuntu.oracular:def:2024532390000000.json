		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: 6fire: Release resources at card releaseThe current 6fire code tries to release the resources right after thecall of usb6fire_chip_abort().  But at this moment, the card objectmight be still in use (as we're calling snd_card_free_when_closed()).For avoid potential UAFs, move the release of resources to the card'sprivate_free instead of the manual call of usb6fire_chip_destroy() atthe USB disconnect callback.",
