		"title": "CVE-2018-13405 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - medium",
		"description": "The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through3.16 allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership,in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writableby a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the non-member cantrigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. Theintended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of adirectory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. Thenon-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable andSGID.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-13405` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
