		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init error pathIn an event where the platform running the device control planeis rebooted, reset is detected on the driver. It releasesall the resources and waits for the reset to complete. Once thereset is done, it tries to build the resources back. At thistime if the device control plane is not yet started, thenthe driver timeouts on the virtchnl message and retries toestablish the mailbox again.In the retry flow, mailbox is deinitialized but the mailboxworkqueue is still alive and polling for the mailbox message.This results in accessing the released control queue leading tonull-ptr-deref. Fix it by unrolling the work queue cancellationand mailbox deinitialization in the reverse order which they gotinitialized.",
