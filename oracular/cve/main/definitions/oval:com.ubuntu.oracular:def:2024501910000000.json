		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem errorsWhen the filesystem is mounted with errors=remount-ro, we were settingSB_RDONLY flag to stop all filesystem modifications. We knew this missesproper locking (sb->s_umount) and does not go through proper filesystemremount procedure but it has been the way this worked since early ext2days and it was good enough for catastrophic situation damagemitigation. Recently, syzbot has found a way (see link) to triggerwarnings in filesystem freezing because the code got confused bySB_RDONLY changing under its hands. Since these days we setEXT4_FLAGS_SHUTDOWN on the superblock which is enough to stop allfilesystem modifications, modifying SB_RDONLY shouldn't be needed. Sostop doing that.",
