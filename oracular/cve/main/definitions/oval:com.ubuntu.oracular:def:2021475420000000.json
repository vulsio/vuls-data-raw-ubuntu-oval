		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:qlogic: qlcnic: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings()In qlcnic_83xx_add_rings(), the indirect function ofahw->hw_ops->alloc_mbx_args will be called to allocate memory forcmd.req.arg, and there is a dereference of it in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings(),which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of the indirectfunction like qlcnic_83xx_alloc_mbx_args(). Fix this bug by adding a checkof alloc_mbx_args(), this patch imitates the logic of mbx_cmd()'s failurehandling. This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employsdifferential checking to identify inconsistent security operations (e.g.,checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the inconsistentoperations are not recovered in the current function or the callers, sothey constitute bugs. Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it canbe a false positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers havecross-reviewed the bug. Builds with CONFIG_QLCNIC=m show no new warnings,and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47542` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
