		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:mac80211: improve CSA/ECSA connection refusal As mentioned in the previouscommit, we pretty quickly found that some APs have ECSA elements stuck intheir probe response, so using that to not attempt to connect while CSA ishappening we never connect to such an AP. Improve this situation bychecking more carefully and ignoring the ECSA if cfg80211 has previouslydetected the ECSA element being stuck in the probe response. Additionally,allow connecting to an AP that's switching to a channel it's already using,unless it's using quiet mode. In this case, we may just have to adjustbandwidth later. If it's actually switching channels, it's better not totry to connect in the middle of that.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26682` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
