		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i40e: Fix macvlan leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hashThis patch addresses a macvlan leak issue in the i40e driver caused byconcurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash. The leak occurs when multiplethreads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading toinconsistent state and potential memory leaks.To fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroingvf->default_lan_addr.addr withspin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock),ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.Additionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) ini40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.Reproduction steps:1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them.2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting\tportvlan and/or mac filters).3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the\tmac_filter_hash.This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash andpreventsthe described leak.",
