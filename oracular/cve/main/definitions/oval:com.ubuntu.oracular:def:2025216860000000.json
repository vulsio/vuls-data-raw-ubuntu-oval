		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contextsWhen IORING_REGISTER_CLONE_BUFFERS is used to clone buffers from uringinstance A to uring instance B, where A and B use different MMs foraccounting, the accounting can go wrong:If uring instance A is closed before uring instance B, the pinned memorycounters for uring instance B will be decremented, even though the pinnedmemory was originally accounted through uring instance A; so the MM ofuring instance B can end up with negative locked memory.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2025-21686` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
