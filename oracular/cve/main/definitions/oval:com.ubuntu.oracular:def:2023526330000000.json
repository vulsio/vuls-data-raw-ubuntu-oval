		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: um:time-travel: fix time corruption In 'basic' time-travel mode (without=inf-cpu or =ext), we still get timer interrupts. These can happen atarbitrary points in time, i.e. while in timer_read(), which pushes timeforward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get the interrupt aftercalculating the new time to push to, but before actually finishing that,the interrupt will set the time to a value that's incompatible with theforward, and we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do theforwarding. Fix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating theadjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts disabled.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52633` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
