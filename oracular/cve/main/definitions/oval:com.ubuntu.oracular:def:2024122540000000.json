		"title": "CVE-2024-12254 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - medium",
		"description": "Starting in Python 3.12.0, theasyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines() method would not \"pause\" writing and signal to the Protocol to drainthe buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the \"high-watermark\". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.This vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio modulewith protocols, and using .writelines() method which had newzero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all ofthese factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.",
