		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ring-buffer: Fix reader locking when changing the sub buffer orderThe function ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set() updates eachring_buffer_per_cpu and installs new sub buffers that match the requestedpage order. This operation may be invoked concurrently with readers thatrely on some of the modified data, such as the head bit (RB_PAGE_HEAD), orthe ring_buffer_per_cpu.pages and reader_page pointers. However, noexclusive access is acquired by ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set(). Modifyingthe mentioned data while a reader also operates on them can then result inincorrect memory access and various crashes.Fix the problem by taking the reader_lock when updating a specificring_buffer_per_cpu in ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set().",
