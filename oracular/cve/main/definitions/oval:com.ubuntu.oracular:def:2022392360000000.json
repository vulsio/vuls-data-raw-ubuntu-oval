		"description": "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript.Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events candisrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentiallyimpacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that thematrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding orcorrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched inmatrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the syncprocessor to store data, and restarting the client are possibleworkarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearingall storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to anunaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to othervulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39236` to fix the vulnerability.
