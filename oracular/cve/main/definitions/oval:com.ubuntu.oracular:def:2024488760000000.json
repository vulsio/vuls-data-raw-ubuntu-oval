		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:stackdepot: fix stack_depot_save_flags() in NMI contextPer documentation, stack_depot_save_flags() was meant to be usable fromNMI context if STACK_DEPOT_FLAG_CAN_ALLOC is unset.  However, it stillwould try to take the pool_lock in an attempt to save a stack trace in thecurrent pool (if space is available).This could result in deadlock if an NMI is handled while pool_lock isalready held.  To avoid deadlock, only try to take the lock in NMI contextand give up if unsuccessful.The documentation is fixed to clearly convey this.",
