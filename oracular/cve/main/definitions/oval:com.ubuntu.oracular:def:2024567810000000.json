		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/prom_init: Fixup missing powermac #size-cellsOn some powermacs `escc` nodes are missing `#size-cells` properties,which is deprecated and now triggers a warning at boot since commit045b14ca5c36 (\"of: WARN on deprecated #address-cells/#size-cellshandling\").For example:  Missing '#size-cells' in /pci@f2000000/mac-io@c/escc@13000  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at drivers/of/base.c:133of_bus_n_size_cells+0x98/0x108  Hardware name: PowerMac3,1 7400 0xc0209 PowerMac  ...

Notethat `escc-legacy` nodes are also missing `#size-cells` properties, butthey are skipped by the macio driver, so leave them alone.Depends-on: 045b14ca5c36 (\"of: WARN on deprecated#address-cells/#size-cells handling\")",
