		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mtd: spinand: winbond: Fix 512GW, 01GW, 01JW and 02JW ECC informationThese four chips:* W25N512GW* W25N01GW* W25N01JW* W25N02JWall require a single bit of ECC strength and thus feature an on-dieHamming-like ECC engine. There is no point in filling a ->get_status()callback for them because the main ECC status bytes are located instandard places, and retrieving the number of bitflips in case ofcorrected chunk is both useless and unsupported (if there are bitflips,then there is 1 at most, so no need to query the chip for that).Without this change, a kernel warning triggers every time a bit flips.",
