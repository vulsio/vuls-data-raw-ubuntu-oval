		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix NULL dereference in AEAD crypto operationWhen sealing or unsealing a key blob we currently do not wait forthe AEAD cipher operation to finish and simply return after submittingthe request. If there is some load on the system we can exit beforethe cipher operation is done and the buffer we read from/write tois already removed from the stack. This will e.g. result in NULLpointer dereference errors in the DCP driver during blob creation.Fix this by waiting for the AEAD cipher operation to finish beforeresuming the seal and unseal calls.",
