		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: usb: lan78xx: Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocationIn lan78xx_probe(), the buffer `buf` was being freed twice: onceimplicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the`URB_FREE_BUFFER` flag and again explicitly by `kfree(buf)`. This causeda double free issue.To resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls tosimplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant`kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`, ensuringit is correctly managed by  `usb_fill_int_urb()` and freed by`usb_free_urb()` as intended.",
