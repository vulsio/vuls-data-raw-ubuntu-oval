		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSD: Fix NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE's handling of large file sizesiattr::ia_size is a loff_t, so these NFSv3 procedures must becareful to deal with incoming client size values that are largerthan s64_max without corrupting the value.Silently capping the value results in storing a different valuethan the client passed in which is unexpected behavior, so removethe min_t() check in decode_sattr3().Note that RFC 1813 permits only the WRITE procedure to returnNFS3ERR_FBIG. We believe that NFSv3 reference implementationsalso return NFS3ERR_FBIG when ia_size is too large.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48829` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
