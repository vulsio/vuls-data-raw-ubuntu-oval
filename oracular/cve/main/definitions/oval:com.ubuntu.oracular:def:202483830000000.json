		"description": "Firefox normally asks for confirmation before asking the operating systemto find an application to handle a scheme that the browser does notsupport. It did not ask before doing so for the Usenet-related schemesnews: and snews:. Since most operating systems don't have a trustednewsreader installed by default, an unscrupulous program that the userdownloaded could register itself as a handler. The website that served theapplication download could then launch that application at will. Thisvulnerability affects Firefox < 130, Firefox ESR < 128.2, and Firefox ESR <115.15.",
