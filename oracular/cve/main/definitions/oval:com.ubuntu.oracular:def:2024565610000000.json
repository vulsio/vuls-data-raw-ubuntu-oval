		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: endpoint: Fix PCI domain ID release in pci_epc_destroy()pci_epc_destroy() invokes pci_bus_release_domain_nr() to release the PCIdomain ID, but there are two issues:  - 'epc->dev' is passed to pci_bus_release_domain_nr() which was already    freed by device_unregister(), leading to a use-after-free issue.  - Domain ID corresponds to the EPC device parent, so passing 'epc->dev'    is also wrong.Fix these issues by passing 'epc->dev.parent' topci_bus_release_domain_nr() and also do it before device_unregister().[mani: reworded subject and description]",
