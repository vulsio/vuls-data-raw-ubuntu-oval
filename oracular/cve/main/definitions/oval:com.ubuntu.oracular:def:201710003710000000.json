		"title": "CVE-2017-1000371 on Ubuntu 24.10 (oracular) - medium",
		"description": "The offset2lib patch as used by the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability,if RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte of memory isallocated (the maximum under the 1/4 restriction) then the stack will begrown down to 0x80000000, and as the PIE binary is mapped above 0x80000000the minimum distance between the end of the PIE binary's read-write segmentand the start of the stack becomes small enough that the stack guard pagecan be jumped over by an attacker. This affects Linux Kernel version4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 andCVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000371` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
