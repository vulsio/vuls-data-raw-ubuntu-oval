		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by theMatrix.org Foundation. A malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X withpermission to create certain state events can disable outbound federationfrom X to an arbitrary homeserver Y. Synapse instances with federationdisabled are not affected. In versions of Synapse up to and including 1.73,Synapse did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, meaning that it waspossible to create an arbitrarily large invite event. Synapse 1.74 refusesto create oversized `invite_room_state` fields. Server operators shouldupgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.",
