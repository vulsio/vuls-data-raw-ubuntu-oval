This bugwas later reproduced when the driver was copied to create the qmp-usbcdriver.Restore the driver data initialisation at probe to avoid a NULL-pointerdereference on runtime suspend.Apparently no one uses runtime PM, which currently needs to be enabledmanually through sysfs, with these drivers.",
