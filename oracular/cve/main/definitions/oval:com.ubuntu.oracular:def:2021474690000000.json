		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses Currently we have aglobal spi_add_lock which we take when adding new devices so that we cancheck that we're not trying to reuse a chip select that's alreadycontrolled. This means that if the SPI device is itself a SPI controllerand triggers the instantiation of further SPI devices we trigger a deadlockas we try to register and instantiate those devices while in the process ofdoing so for the parent controller and hence already holding the globalspi_add_lock. Since we only care about concurrency within a single SPI busmove the lock to be per controller, avoiding the deadlock. This can beeasily triggered in the case of spi-mux.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47469` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
