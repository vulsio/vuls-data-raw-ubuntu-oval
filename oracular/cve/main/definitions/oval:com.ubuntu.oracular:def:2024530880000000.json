		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync stateFix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filtersbecoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs underheavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLANfilters by setting mac and port VLAN.1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.Reproduction steps:1. Spawn multiple VFs.2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.3. Observe errors in dmesg:\"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,\tplease set promiscuous on manually for VF XX\".Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly butmust be removed using the full process.",
