		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:arm64/neonbs - fix out-of-bounds access on short input The bit-slicedimplementation of AES-CTR operates on blocks of 128 bytes, and will fallback to the plain NEON version for tail blocks or inputs that are shorterthan 128 bytes to begin with. It will call straight into the plain NEON asmhelper, which performs all memory accesses in granules of 16 bytes (thesize of a NEON register). For this reason, the associated plain NEON gluecode will copy inputs shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer, giventhat this is a rare occurrence and it is not worth the effort to workaround this in the asm code. The fallback from the bit-sliced NEON versionfails to take this into account, potentially resulting in out-of-boundsaccesses. So clone the same workaround, and use a temp buffer for shortin/outputs.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26789` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
