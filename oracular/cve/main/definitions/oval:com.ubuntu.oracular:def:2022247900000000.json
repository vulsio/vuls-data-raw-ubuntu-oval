When using Puma behind a proxy that does notproperly validate that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a requeststarts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-endproxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Usersare advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround: when deploying aproxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality to make surethat the request matches the RFC7230 standard.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24790` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npuma - 5.6.5-3ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
