		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfs: Fix ceph copy to cache on write-beginAt the end of netfs_unlock_read_folio() in which folios are markedappropriately for copying to the cache (either with by being marked dirtyand having their private data set or by having PG_private_2 set) and thenunlocked, the folio_queue struct has the entry pointing to the foliocleared.  This presents a problem for netfs_pgpriv2_write_to_the_cache(),which is used to write folios marked with PG_private_2 to the cache as itexpects to be able to trawl the folio_queue list thereafter to find therelevant folios, leading to a hang.Fix this by not clearing the folio_queue entry if we're going to do thedeprecated copy-to-cache.  The clearance will be done instead as the foliosare written to the cache.This can be reproduced by starting cachefiles, mounting a ceph filesystemwith \"-o fsc\" and writing to it.",
