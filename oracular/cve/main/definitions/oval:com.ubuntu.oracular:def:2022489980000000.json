The problem is encouteredwith tests added by commit 38608ee7b690 (\"bpf, tests: Add load storetest case for tail call\")This happens because tail call is done to a BPF prog with a differentstack_depth. At the time being, the stack is kept as is when the callertail calls its callee. But at exit, the callee restores the stack basedon its own properties. Therefore here, at each run, r1 is erroneouslyincreased by 32 - 16 = 16 bytes.This was done that way in order to pass the tail call count from callerto callee through the stack. As powerpc32 doesn't have a red zone inthe stack, it was necessary the maintain the stack as is for the tailcall. But it was not anticipated that the BPF frame size could bedifferent.Let's take a new approach. Use register r4 to carry the tail call countduring the tail call, and save it into the stack at function entry ifrequired. This means the input parameter must be in r3, which is morecorrect as it is a 32 bits parameter, then tail call better match withnormal BPF function entry, the down side being that we move that inputparameter back and forth between r3 and r4. That can be optimised later.Doing that also has the advantage of maximising the common parts betweentail calls and a normal function exit.With the fix, tail call tests are now successfull:  test_bpf: #0 Tail call leaf jited:1 53 PASS  test_bpf: #1 Tail call 2 jited:1 115 PASS  test_bpf: #2 Tail call 3 jited:1 154 PASS  test_bpf: #3 Tail call 4 jited:1 165 PASS  test_bpf: #4 Tail call load/store leaf jited:1 101 PASS  test_bpf: #5 Tail call load/store jited:1 141 PASS  test_bpf: #6 Tail call error path, max count reached jited:1 994 PASS  test_bpf: #7 Tail call count preserved across function calls jited:1140975 PASS  test_bpf: #8 Tail call error path, NULL target jited:1 110 PASS  test_bpf: #9 Tail call error path, index out of range jited:1 69 PASS  test_bpf: test_tail_calls: Summary: 10 PASSED, 0 FAILED, [10/10 JIT'ed]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48998` to fix the vulnerability.
