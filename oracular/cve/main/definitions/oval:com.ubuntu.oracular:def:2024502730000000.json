		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the listAt insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existingref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head'sref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list membernot reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of thelist to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which canhappen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transactionabort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we calllist_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false sincethe list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequencewe call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in aninvalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poisonpointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED andCONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferencesotherwise.So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",
