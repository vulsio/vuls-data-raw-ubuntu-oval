		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB KASAN is seen toincrease stack usage, to the point that it was reported to lead to stackoverflow on some 32-bit machines (see link). To avoid overflows the stacksize was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07 (\"powerpc/kasan:Force thread size increase with KASAN\"). However with a 32KB stack size tobegin with, the doubling leads to a 64KB stack, which causes build errors:arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range(0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and0x0000000000007fff) Although the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KBstack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seemsto be in the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build. So only increase thestack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26710` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
