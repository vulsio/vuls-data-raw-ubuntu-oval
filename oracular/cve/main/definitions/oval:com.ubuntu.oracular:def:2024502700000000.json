		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/damon/core: avoid overflow in damon_feed_loop_next_input()damon_feed_loop_next_input() is inefficient and fragile to overflows.Specifically, 'score_goal_diff_bp' calculation can overflow when 'score'is high.  The calculation is actually unnecessary at all because 'goal' isa constant of value 10,000.  Calculation of 'compensation' is againfragile to overflow.  Final calculation of return value for under-achivingcase is again fragile to overflow when the current score isunder-achieving the target.Add two corner cases handling at the beginning of the function to make thebody easier to read, and rewrite the body of the function to avoidoverflows and the unnecessary bp value calcuation.",
