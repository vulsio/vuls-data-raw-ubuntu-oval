		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: Fix circular locking dependency The rule inside kvm enforces thatthe vcpu->mutex is taken *inside* kvm->lock. The rule is violated by thepkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquires the kvm->lock while already holding thevcpu->mutex lock from kvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular lockingdependency altogether by protecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock,much like we already do for other forms of VM-scoped data.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26691` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
