		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid NULL pointer dereferenceiwl_mvm_tx_skb_sta() and iwl_mvm_tx_mpdu() verify that the mvmvstapointer is not NULL.It retrieves this pointer using iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211, which isdereferencing the ieee80211_sta pointer.If sta is NULL, iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211 will dereference a NULLpointer.Fix this by checking the sta pointer before retrieving the mvmstafrom it. If sta is not NULL, then mvmsta isn't either.",
