		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by asignalvsock_connect() expects that the socket could already be in theTCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes up with a signalpending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, andit is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it'scommon for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection issuccessful the socket will be added to the connected table a secondtime, corrupting the list.Prevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is receivedwhile waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not inthe connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it willprevent list corruption from a double add.Note for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e (\"vsock: correctremoval of socket from the list\"), which is in all current stable treesexcept 4.9.y.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48786` to fix the vulnerability.
