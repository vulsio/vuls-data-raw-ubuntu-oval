		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: Prevent a bad reference count on CPU nodesWhen populating cache leaves we previously fetched the CPU device nodeat the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through aspecific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' forthe node that was acquired.Since we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, wecan simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, andwe are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.Moreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiringthe device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case.",
