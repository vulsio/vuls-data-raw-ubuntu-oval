The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsnap-confine - 2.65.3+24.10\nsnapd - 2.65.3+24.10\nsnapd-xdg-open - 2.65.3+24.10\nubuntu-core-launcher - 2.65.3+24.10\nubuntu-core-snapd-units - 2.65.3+24.10\nubuntu-snappy - 2.65.3+24.10\nubuntu-snappy-cli - 2.65.3+24.10\nNo subscription required",
