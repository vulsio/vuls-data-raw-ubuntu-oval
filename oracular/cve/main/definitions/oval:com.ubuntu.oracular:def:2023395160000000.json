		"description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault managementframework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison datastored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed byadministrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim'sbrowser at view-time. The script under `data_sources.php` displays the datasource management information (e.g. data source path, polling configurationetc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. CENSUS foundthat an adversary that is able to configure a malicious data-source path,can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader)privileges. A user that possesses the 'GeneralAdministration>Sites/Devices/Data' permissions can configure the datasource path in Cacti. This configuration occurs through`http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. The same page can be used forpreviewing the data source path. This issue has been addressed in version1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade shouldmanually escape HTML output.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39516` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncacti - 1.2.26+ds1-1\nNo subscription required",
