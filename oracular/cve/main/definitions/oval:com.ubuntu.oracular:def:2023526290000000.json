		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sh:push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug Theoriginal code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync() inswitch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop the worker, itcould be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result, a use-after-free bugcan occur. The details are shown below: (cpu 0) | (cpu 1)switch_drv_remove() | flush_work() | ... | switch_timer // timer |schedule_work(&psw->work) timer_shutdown_sync() | ... | switch_work_handler// worker kfree(psw) // free | | psw->state = 0 // use This patch putstimer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to mitigate the bugs. As aresult, the worker and timer will be stopped safely before the deallocateoperations.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52629` to fix the vulnerability.
