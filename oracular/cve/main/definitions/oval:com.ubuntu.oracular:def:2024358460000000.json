		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory Christian reportsa NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap shrinker. Theissue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1] and the Red Hatbugzilla [2]. The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot timeflag, the zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL. This isokay in many places, like the lruvec operations. But it crashes inmemcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting ofcgroup's the zswap memory to begin with. Nhat spotted that the memcg can beNULL in the memcg-disabled case, and I was then able to reproduce the crashlocally as well.
