		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/pci: Fix disabling memory if DVSEC CXL Range does not match a CFMWSwindow The Linux CXL subsystem is built on the assumption that HPA == SPA.That is, the host physical address (HPA) the HDM decoder registers areprogrammed with are system physical addresses (SPA). During HDM decodersetup, the DVSEC CXL range registers (cxl-3.1, 8.1.3.8) are checked if thememory is enabled and the CXL range is in a HPA window that is described ina CFMWS structure of the CXL host bridge (cxl-3.1, 9.18.1.3). Now, if theHPA is not an SPA, the CXL range does not match a CFMWS window and the CXLmemory range will be disabled then. The HDM decoder stops working whichcauses system memory being disabled and further a system hang during HDMdecoder initialization, typically when a CXL enabled kernel boots. Preventa system hang and do not disable the HDM decoder if the decoder's CXL rangeis not found in a CFMWS window. Note the change only fixes a hardware hang,but does not implement HPA/SPA translation. Support for this can be addedin a follow on patch series.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26761` to fix the vulnerability.
