		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flushIn terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty.And if an application does overflow a bit, it'll have a few entries.However, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test casethat generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them cantake quite a while.Check for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks anddo so if necessary. There's no state to maintain here as overflowsalways prune from head-of-list, hence it's fine to drop and reacquirethe locks at the end of the loop.",
