		"description": "Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Acommand injection vulnerability on the 1.3.x DEV branch allows anyunauthenticated user to execute arbitrary command on the server when`register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. In `cmd_realtime.php` line 119,the `$poller_id` used as part of the command execution is sourced from`$_SERVER['argv']`, which can be controlled by URL when`register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. And this option is `On` bydefault in many environments such as the main PHP Docker image for PHP.Commit 53e8014d1f082034e0646edc6286cde3800c683d contains a patch for theissue, but this commit was reverted in commit99633903cad0de5ace636249de16f77e57a3c8fc.",
