		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: enetc:Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint irq_set_affinity_hit() storesa reference to the cpumask_t parameter in the irq descriptor, and thatreference can be accessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Sincethe cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has only temporarystorage (it's on the stack memory), later accesses to it are illegal. Thusreads from the corresponding procfs affinity_hint file can result in pagingrequest oops. The issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, whichprovides a permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47368` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic - 6.8.0-31.31\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-generic-64k - 6.8.0-31.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-aws - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-azure - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gcp - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-31-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-31.31.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle - 6.8.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1004-raspi - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
