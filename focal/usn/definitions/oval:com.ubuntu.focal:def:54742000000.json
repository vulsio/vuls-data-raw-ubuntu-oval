		"description": "USN-5474-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Varnish Cache. Unfortunately the fix for CVE-2020-11653 was incomplete. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Varnish Cache could have an assertion failure when a  TLS termination proxy uses PROXY version 2. A remote attacker could possibly  use this issue to restart the daemon and cause a performance loss.  (CVE-2020-11653)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5474-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  varnish - 6.2.1-2ubuntu0.2 varnish-doc - 6.2.1-2ubuntu0.2 libvarnishapi-dev - 6.2.1-2ubuntu0.2 libvarnishapi2 - 6.2.1-2ubuntu0.2 No subscription required",
