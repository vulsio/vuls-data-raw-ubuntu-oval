		"description": "Daniel Moghimi discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly clear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various instructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to sensitive information. (CVE-2022-40982)  Tavis Ormandy discovered that some AMD processors did not properly handle speculative execution of certain vector register instructions. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20593)  It was discovered that the universal 32bit network packet classifier implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3609)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing network scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3611)  It was discovered that the network packet classifier with netfilter/firewall marks implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3776)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6324-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-gkeop-headers-5.4.0-1075 - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-tools-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-image-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-gkeop-source-5.4.0 - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-headers-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-gkeop-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1075 - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-gkeop-tools-5.4.0-1075 - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-modules-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79 No subscription required  linux-image-gkeop-5.4 - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-headers-gkeop - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-gkeop-5.4 - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-image-gkeop - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-modules-extra-gkeop-5.4 - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-gkeop - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-cloud-tools-gkeop - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-modules-extra-gkeop - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-tools-gkeop - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-tools-gkeop-5.4 - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-headers-gkeop-5.4 - 5.4.0.1075.73 linux-cloud-tools-gkeop-5.4 - 5.4.0.1075.73 No subscription required",
