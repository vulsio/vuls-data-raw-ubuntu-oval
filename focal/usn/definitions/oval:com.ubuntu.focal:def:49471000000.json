		"description": "Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the x25 implementation in the Linux kernel contained overflows when handling addresses from user space. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-35519)  It was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not prevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2021-28375)  It was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate passed encryption key sizes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29646)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)  Arnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-30002)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4947-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.6.0-1056-oem - 5.6.0-1056.60 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.6.0.1056.52 No subscription required",
