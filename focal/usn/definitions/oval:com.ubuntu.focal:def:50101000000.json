		"description": "Lei Sun discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain MMIO operations. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-15469)  Wenxiang Qian discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain ATAPI commands. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2020-29443)  Cheolwoo Myung discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled SCSI device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-35504, CVE-2020-35505, CVE-2021-3392)  Alex Xu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio-fs shared file system daemon. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to read and write to host devices. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.10. (CVE-2020-35517)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled ARM Generic Interrupt Controller emulation. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.10. (CVE-2021-20221)  Alexander Bulekov, Cheolwoo Myung, Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann, and Simon Werner discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled e1000 device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to hang, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.10. (CVE-2021-20257)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled SDHCI controller emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. In the default installation, when QEMU is used in combination with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. (CVE-2021-3409)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain NIC emulation devices. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to hang or crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.10. (CVE-2021-3416)  Remy Noel discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the USB redirector device. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3527)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio vhost-user GPU device. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2021-3544)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio vhost-user GPU device. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive host information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2021-3545)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio vhost-user GPU device. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. In the default installation, when QEMU is used in combination with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2021-3546)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the PVRDMA device. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. In the default installation, when QEMU is used in combination with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2021-3582, CVE-2021-3607, CVE-2021-3608)  It was discovered that QEMU SLiRP networking incorrectly handled certain udp packets. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to leak sensitive information from the host.
