		"description": "Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory allocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to potential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42703)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3524)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3564)  It was discovered that the ISDN implementation of the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3565)  It was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3566)  It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8152 USB Ethernet adapter driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3594)  It was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3621)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5756-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-modules-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-azure-tools-5.4.0-1098 - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-azure-headers-5.4.0-1098 - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-headers-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-azure-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1098 - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-tools-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 linux-image-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104 No subscription required  linux-tools-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1098.92 linux-modules-extra-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1098.92 linux-image-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1098.92 linux-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1098.92 linux-headers-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1098.92 linux-cloud-tools-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1098.92 No subscription required",
