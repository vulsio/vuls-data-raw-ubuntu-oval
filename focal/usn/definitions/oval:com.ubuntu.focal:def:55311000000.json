		"description": "Pietro Borrello discovered that protobuf-c contained an invalid arithmetic shift. This vulnerability allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via unspecified vectors (CVE-2022-33070).  It was discovered that protobuf-c contained an unsigned integer overflow. This vulnerability allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via unspecified vectors.  Todd Miller discovered that protobuf-c contained a possible NULL dereference. This could cause a vulnerability that allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via unspecified vectors.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5531-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libprotobuf-c-dev - 1.3.3-1ubuntu0.1 protobuf-c-compiler - 1.3.3-1ubuntu0.1 libprotobuf-c1 - 1.3.3-1ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
