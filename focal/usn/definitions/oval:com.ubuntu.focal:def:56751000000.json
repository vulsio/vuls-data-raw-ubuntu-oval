		"description": "Isaac Boukris and Andrew Bartlett discovered that Heimdal's KDC was not properly performing checksum algorithm verifications in the S4U2Self extension module. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack and request S4U2Self tickets for any user known by the application. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-16860)  It was discovered that Heimdal was not properly handling the verification of key exchanges when an anonymous PKINIT was being used. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack and expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-12098)  Joseph Sutton discovered that Heimdal was not properly handling memory management operations when dealing with TGS-REQ tickets that were missing information. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3671)  Michał Kępień discovered that Heimdal was not properly handling logical conditions that related to memory management operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-3116)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5675-1` to fix the vulnerability.
