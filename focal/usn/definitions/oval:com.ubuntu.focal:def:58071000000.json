If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted XPM file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libXpm to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-44617)  Marco Ivaldi discovered that libXpm incorrectly handled certain XPM files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted XPM file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libXpm to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-46285)  Alan Coopersmith discovered that libXpm incorrectly handled calling external helper binaries. If libXpm was being used by a setuid binary, a local attacker could possibly use this issue to escalate privileges.
