		"description": "Loris Reiff discovered that the BPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in the getsockopt BPF hook. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-20194)  It was discovered that the priority inheritance futex implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3347)  It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability during device setup. A local attacker with access to the nbd device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3348)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4884-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.10.0-1017-oem - 5.10.0-1017.18 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1017.18 linux-image-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1017.18 No subscription required",
