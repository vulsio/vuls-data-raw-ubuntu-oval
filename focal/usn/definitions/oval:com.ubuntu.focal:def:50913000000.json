		"title": "USN-5091-3 -- Linux kernel (Azure) regression",
		"description": "USN-5091-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Linux 5.4-based kernels. Unfortunately, for Linux kernels intended for use within Microsoft Azure environments, that update introduced a regression that could cause the kernel to fail to boot in large Azure instance types. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Ofek Kirzner, Adam Morrison, Benedict Schlueter, and Piotr Krysiuk  discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel missed possible  mispredicted branches due to type confusion, allowing a side-channel  attack. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.  (CVE-2021-33624)   It was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not  properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker  could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)   Alexey Kardashevskiy discovered that the KVM implementation for PowerPC  systems in the Linux kernel did not properly validate RTAS arguments in  some situations. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial  of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2021-37576)   It was discovered that the Virtio console implementation in the Linux  kernel did not properly validate input lengths in some situations. A local  attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system  crash). (CVE-2021-38160)   Michael Wakabayashi discovered that the NFSv4 client implementation in the  Linux kernel did not properly order connection setup operations. An  attacker controlling a remote NFS server could use this to cause a denial  of service on the client. (CVE-2021-38199)   It was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux  kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically  proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system  crash). (CVE-2021-38204)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5091-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-image-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-headers-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-azure-headers-5.4.0-1061 - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-modules-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-azure-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1061 - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-azure-tools-5.4.0-1061 - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-tools-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-1061-azure - 5.4.0-1061.64 No subscription required  linux-image-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1061.59 linux-cloud-tools-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1061.59 linux-tools-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1061.59 linux-modules-extra-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1061.59 linux-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1061.59 linux-headers-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1061.59 No subscription required",
