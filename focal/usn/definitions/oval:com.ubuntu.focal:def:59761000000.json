		"description": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in certain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)  It was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2 VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)  It was discovered that the Intel 740 frame buffer driver in the Linux kernel contained a divide by zero vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3061)  It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3628)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36280)  It was discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3646)  Khalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3649)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Roccat HID driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41850)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0394)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5976-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-oem-5.14-headers-5.14.0-1059 - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-headers-5.14.0-1059-oem - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-modules-5.14.0-1059-oem - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-image-5.14.0-1059-oem - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-tools-5.14.0-1059-oem - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-oem-5.14-tools-5.14.0-1059 - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1059-oem - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.14.0-1059-oem - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-oem-5.14-tools-host - 5.14.0-1059.67 linux-buildinfo-5.14.0-1059-oem - 5.14.0-1059.67 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-image-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-headers-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-tools-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-tools-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-tools-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-headers-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-headers-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-headers-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-tools-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1059.57 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1059.57 No subscription required",
