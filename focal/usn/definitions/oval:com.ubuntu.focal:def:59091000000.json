		"description": "It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3628)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth stack in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3640)  Khalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3649)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the SMSC UFX USB driver implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41849)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Roccat HID driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41850)  Tam√°s Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-42895)  It was discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-20928)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5909-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1103.109+cvm1.1 linux-image-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1103.109+cvm1.1 No subscription required  linux-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1103.109+cvm1.36 linux-modules-extra-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1103.109+cvm1.36 linux-image-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1103.109+cvm1.36 linux-cloud-tools-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1103.109+cvm1.36 linux-tools-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1103.109+cvm1.36 linux-headers-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1103.109+cvm1.36 No subscription required",
