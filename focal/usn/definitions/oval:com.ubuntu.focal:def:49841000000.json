		"description": "Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28660)  It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-28688)  It was discovered that the fuse user space file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-28950)  John Stultz discovered that the audio driver for Qualcomm SDM845 systems in the Linux kernel did not properly validate port ID numbers. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28952)  Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)  Vince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell processors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)  It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28972)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-29647)  Arnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-30002)  Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)  It was discovered that the CIPSO implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to use- after-free vulnerabilities. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33033)  马哲宇 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4984-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.8.0-55-generic-64k - 5.8.0-55.62~20.04.1 linux-image-5.8.0-55-generic-lpae - 5.8.0-55.62~20.04.1 linux-image-5.8.0-55-generic - 5.8.0-55.62~20.04.1 linux-image-5.8.0-55-lowlatency - 5.8.0-55.62~20.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-virtual-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-virtual-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-generic-64k-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-generic-64k-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.55.62~20.04.39 No subscription required",
