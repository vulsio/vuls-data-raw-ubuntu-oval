		"description": "USN-7117-1 fixed vulnerabilities in needrestart. The update introduced a regression in needrestart. This update fixes the problem for LXC containers.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Qualys discovered that needrestart passed unsanitized data to a library   (libmodule-scandeps-perl) which expects safe input. A local attacker could  possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code as root.  (CVE-2024-11003)    Qualys discovered that the library libmodule-scandeps-perl incorrectly   parsed perl code. This could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary  shell commands. (CVE-2024-10224)    Qualys discovered that needrestart incorrectly used the PYTHONPATH   environment variable to spawn a new Python interpreter. A local attacker   could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code as root.   (CVE-2024-48990)    Qualys discovered that needrestart incorrectly checked the path to the  Python interpreter. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to win  a race condition and execute arbitrary code as root. (CVE-2024-48991)    Qualys discovered that needrestart incorrectly used the RUBYLIB  environment variable to spawn a new Ruby interpreter. A local attacker  could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code as root.  (CVE-2024-48992)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7117-3` to fix the vulnerability.
