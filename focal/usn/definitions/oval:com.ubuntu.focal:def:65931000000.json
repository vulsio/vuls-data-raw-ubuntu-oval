		"description": "It was discovered that GnuTLS had a timing side-channel when processing malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover sensitive information. (CVE-2024-0553)  It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled certain certificate chains with a cross-signing loop. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause GnuTLS to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 23.04, and Ubuntu 23.10. (CVE-2024-0567)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6593-1` to fix the vulnerability.
