		"description": "USN-7096-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 8. The update introduced several minor regressions. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Andy Boothe discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK 8 did not  properly handle access under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated   attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.   (CVE-2024-21208)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not properly  handle vectorization under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated   attacker could possibly use this issue to access unauthorized resources   and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-21210, CVE-2024-21235)    It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK 8 did not   properly handle deserialization under certain circumstances. An   unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial  of service. (CVE-2024-21217)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 was not properly  bounding certain UTF-8 strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow. An  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or  execute arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  (CVE-2024-21131)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 could be made to  run into an infinite loop. If an automated system were tricked into  processing excessively large symbols, an attacker could possibly use this  issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was only addressed in  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21138)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not properly  perform range check elimination. An attacker could possibly use this issue  to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java  sandbox restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.   (CVE-2024-21140)    Yakov Shafranovich discovered that the Concurrency component of OpenJDK 8  incorrectly performed header validation in the Pack200 archive format. An  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This   issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21144)    Sergey Bylokhov discovered that OpenJDK 8 did not properly manage memory  when handling 2D images. An attacker could possibly use this issue to  obtain sensitive information. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu   16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21145)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly  handled memory when performing range check elimination under certain  circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox  restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.   (CVE-2024-21147)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly  handled certain exceptions with specially crafted long messages. An  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.  This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21011)    Vladimir Kondratyev discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8  incorrectly handled address offset calculations in the C1 compiler. An  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service  or execute arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu  16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21068)    Yakov Shafranovich discovered that OpenJDK 8 did not properly manage  memory in the Pack200 archive format. An attacker could possibly use this  issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was only addressed in  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21085)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly  handled array accesses in the C2 compiler. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This  issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21094)    Yi Yang discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly  handled array accesses in the C1 compiler. An attacker could possibly  use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or  bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu  16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20918)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not  properly verify bytecode in certain situations. An attacker could  possibly use this issue to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This   issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20919)    It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 had an  optimization flaw when generating range check loop predicates. An attacker  could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute  arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This issue was only   addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20921)    Valentin Eudeline discovered that OpenJDK 8 incorrectly handled certain  options in the Nashorn JavaScript subcomponent. An attacker could  possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue was only   addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20926)    It was discovered that OpenJDK 8 could produce debug logs that contained  private keys used for digital signatures. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to obtain sensitive information. This issue was only addressed  in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20945)    Hubert Kario discovered that the TLS implementation in OpenJDK 8 had a  timing side-channel and incorrectly handled RSA padding. A remote attacker  could possibly use this issue to recover sensitive information. This   issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
