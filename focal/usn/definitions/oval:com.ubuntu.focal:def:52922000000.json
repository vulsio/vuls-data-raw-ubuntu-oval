		"description": "USN-5292-1 fixed vulnerabilities in snapd. This update provides the corresponding update for the riscv64 architecture.  Original advisory details:   James Troup discovered that snap did not properly manage the permissions for  the snap directories. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to expose  sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3155)    Ian Johnson discovered that snapd did not properly validate content interfaces  and layout paths. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to inject  arbitrary AppArmor policy rules, resulting in a bypass of intended access  restrictions. (CVE-2021-4120)    The Qualys Research Team discovered that snapd did not properly validate the  location of the snap-confine binary. A local attacker could possibly use this  issue to execute other arbitrary binaries and escalate privileges.  (CVE-2021-44730)    The Qualys Research Team discovered that a race condition existed in the snapd  snap-confine binary when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. A  local attacker could possibly use this issue to escalate privileges and  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-44731)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5292-2` to fix the vulnerability.
