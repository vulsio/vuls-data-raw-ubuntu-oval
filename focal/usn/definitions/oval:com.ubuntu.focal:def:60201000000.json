		"description": "It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3669)  It was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2 VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)  Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4382)  It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6020-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66 linux-bluefield-headers-5.4.0-1060 - 5.4.0-1060.66 linux-bluefield-tools-5.4.0-1060 - 5.4.0-1060.66 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66 linux-modules-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66 linux-headers-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66 linux-tools-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66 No subscription required  linux-bluefield - 5.4.0.1060.55 linux-tools-bluefield - 5.4.0.1060.55 linux-image-bluefield - 5.4.0.1060.55 linux-headers-bluefield - 5.4.0.1060.55 No subscription required",
