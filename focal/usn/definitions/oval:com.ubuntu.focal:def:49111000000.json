		"description": "It was discovered that the Nouveau GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25639)  Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)  It was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not prevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2021-28375)  It was discovered that the fuse user space file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-28950)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4911-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.10.0-1021-oem - 5.10.0-1021.22 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1021.22 linux-image-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1021.22 No subscription required",
