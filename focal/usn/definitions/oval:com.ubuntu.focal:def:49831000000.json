		"description": "Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce limits for pointer operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33200)  Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel performed out of bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-29155)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent speculative loads in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-31829)  Reiji Watanabe discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent user space from tampering with an array index value, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3501)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4983-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.10.0-1029-oem - 5.10.0-1029.30 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1029.30 linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.10.0.1029.30 linux-image-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1029.30 No subscription required",
