		"description": "It was discovered that the implementation of the 6pack and mkiss protocols in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1195)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1199)  Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1204)  Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1205)  Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1789)  It was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28388)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-33981)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5539-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47 linux-headers-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47 linux-bluefield-headers-5.4.0-1042 - 5.4.0-1042.47 linux-tools-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47 linux-image-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47 linux-bluefield-tools-5.4.0-1042 - 5.4.0-1042.47 No subscription required  linux-bluefield - 5.4.0.1042.41 linux-tools-bluefield - 5.4.0.1042.41 linux-image-bluefield - 5.4.0.1042.41 linux-headers-bluefield - 5.4.0.1042.41 No subscription required",
