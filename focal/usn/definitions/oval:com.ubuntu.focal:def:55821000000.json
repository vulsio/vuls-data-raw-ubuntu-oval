		"description": "Arthur Mongodin discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data validation. A local attacker could use this to escalate privileges in certain situations. (CVE-2022-34918)  Zhenpeng Lin discovered that the network packet scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly remove all references to a route filter before freeing it in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2588)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not prevent one nft object from referencing an nft set in another nft table, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2586)  It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-0494)  Hu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1048)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)  It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1679)  It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)  Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1974)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic context operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1975)  Felix Fu discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket states, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-28893)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5582-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94+cvm1.2 linux-image-5.4.0-1089-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94+cvm1.2 No subscription required  linux-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1089.94+cvm1.29 linux-modules-extra-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1089.94+cvm1.29 linux-image-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1089.94+cvm1.29 linux-cloud-tools-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1089.94+cvm1.29 linux-tools-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1089.94+cvm1.29 linux-headers-azure-fde - 5.4.0.1089.94+cvm1.29 No subscription required",
