		"description": "It was discovered that the console keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25656)  Minh Yuan discovered that the tty driver in the Linux kernel contained race conditions when handling fonts. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25668)  Bodong Zhao discovered a use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25669)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25704)  Julien Grall discovered that the Xen dom0 event handler in the Linux kernel did not properly limit the number of events queued. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-27673)  Jinoh Kang discovered that the Xen event channel infrastructure in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. An attacker in guest could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (dom0 crash). (CVE-2020-27675)  Daniel Axtens discovered that PowerPC RTAS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict memory accesses in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to arbitrarily modify kernel memory, potentially bypassing kernel lockdown restrictions. (CVE-2020-27777)  It was discovered that the jfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-27815)  Shisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered that Speakup screen reader driver in the Linux kernel did not correctly handle setting line discipline in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-27830, CVE-2020-28941)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the infiniband hfi1 device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-27835)  It was discovered that an information leak existed in the syscall implementation in the Linux kernel on 32 bit systems. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-28588)  Minh Yuan discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle fonts in some conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-28974)  Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered that the Xen event processing backend in the Linux kernel did not properly limit the number of events queued. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-29568)  Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered a race condition the Xen paravirt block backend in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-29569)  Jann Horn discovered that the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel did not use consistent locking in some situations, leading to a read-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-29660)  Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel in the locking for the TIOCSPGRP ioctl(), leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-29661)  It was discovered that a race condition existed that caused the Linux kernel to not properly restrict exit signal delivery. A local attacker could possibly use this to send signals to arbitrary processes. (CVE-2020-35508)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4751-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.8.0-44-lowlatency - 5.8.0-44.50~20.04.1 linux-image-5.8.0-44-generic-lpae - 5.8.0-44.50~20.04.1 linux-image-5.8.0-44-generic - 5.8.0-44.50~20.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-virtual-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-generic-64k-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-generic-64k-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-virtual-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04 - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-20.04-edge - 5.8.0.44.50~20.04.30 No subscription required",
