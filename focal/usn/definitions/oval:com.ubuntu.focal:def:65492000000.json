		"description": "It was discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition while handling device descriptors in certain situations, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-37453)  Lin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a policy data structure, leading to an out-of-bounds vulnerability. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3773)  Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39189)  Sunjoo Park discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate u32 packets content, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39192)  Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SCTP data, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39193)  Lucas Leong discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle state filters, leading to an out- of-bounds read vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39194)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in QXL virtual GPU driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use after free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-39198)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in certain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42754)  Jason Wang discovered that the virtio ring implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle iov buffers in some situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2023-5158)  Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5178)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5717)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6549-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-buildinfo-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-tools-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-image-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-gkeop-5.15-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1034 - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-gkeop-5.15-tools-5.15.0-1034 - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-gkeop-5.15-headers-5.15.0-1034 - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-headers-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-modules-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gkeop - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-gkeop-edge - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-image-gkeop-5.15 - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-cloud-tools-gkeop-edge - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-headers-gkeop-edge - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-headers-gkeop-5.15 - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-tools-gkeop-edge - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-cloud-tools-gkeop-5.15 - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-gkeop-5.15 - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-modules-extra-gkeop-edge - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-gkeop-edge - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-tools-gkeop-5.15 - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 linux-modules-extra-gkeop-5.15 - 5.15.0.1034.40~20.04.30 No subscription required",
