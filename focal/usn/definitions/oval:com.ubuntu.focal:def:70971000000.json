		"description": "Andy Boothe discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK 11 did not properly handle access under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-21208)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 11 did not properly handle vectorization under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to access unauthorized resources and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-21210, CVE-2024-21235)  It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK 11 did not properly handle deserialization under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-21217)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 11 was not properly bounding certain UTF-8 strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21131)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 11 could be made to run into an infinite loop. If an automated system were tricked into processing excessively large symbols, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21138)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 11 did not properly perform range check elimination. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21140)  Yakov Shafranovich discovered that the Concurrency component of OpenJDK 11 incorrectly performed header validation in the Pack200 archive format.
