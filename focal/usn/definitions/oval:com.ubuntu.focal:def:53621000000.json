		"description": "Nick Gregory discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly handled network offload functionality. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-25636)  Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by ARM to their processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-23960)  It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict pointer types in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-23222)  Max Kellermann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly handled Unix pipes. A local attacker could potentially use this to modify any file that could be opened for reading. (CVE-2022-0847)  Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang discovered that the cgroups implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1 release_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2022-0492)  William Liu and Jamie Hill-Daniel discovered that the file system context functionality in the Linux kernel contained an integer underflow vulnerability, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0185)  Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by Intel to their processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0001)  Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)  It was discovered that the NFS server implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4090)  Kirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-4155)  It was discovered that the AMD Radeon GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate writes in the debugfs file system. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42327)  Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0330)  Samuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured. (CVE-2022-0435)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation for s390 systems in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent memory operations on PVM guests that were in non-protected mode. A local attacker could use this to obtain unauthorized memory write access. (CVE-2022-0516)  It was discovered that the ICMPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-0742)  It was discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain failure conditions, leading to a stale entry in the file descriptor table. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2022-22942)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5362-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-buildinfo-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-intel-5.13-source-5.13.0 - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-modules-extra-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-image-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-tools-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-intel-5.13-tools-host - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-intel-5.13-tools-5.13.0-1010 - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-intel-5.13-tools-common - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-headers-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-intel-5.13-cloud-tools-common - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-intel-5.13-headers-5.13.0-1010 - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-intel-5.13-cloud-tools-5.13.0-1010 - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-cloud-tools-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 linux-modules-5.13.0-1010-intel - 5.13.0-1010.10 No subscription required  linux-cloud-tools-intel - 5.13.0.1010.11 linux-tools-intel - 5.13.0.1010.11 linux-intel - 5.13.0.1010.11 linux-headers-intel - 5.13.0.1010.11 linux-image-intel - 5.13.0.1010.11 No subscription required",
