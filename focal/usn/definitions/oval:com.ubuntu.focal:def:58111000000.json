		"description": "Matthieu Barjole and Victor Cutillas discovered that Sudo incorrectly handled user-specified editors when using the sudoedit command. A local attacker that has permission to use the sudoedit command could possibly use this issue to edit arbitrary files. (CVE-2023-22809)  It was discovered that the Protobuf-c library, used by Sudo, incorrectly handled certain arithmetic shifts. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Sudo to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-33070)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5811-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  sudo-ldap - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1.4 sudo - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1.4 No subscription required",
