An attacker could possibly use  this issue to inject additional shell commands and perform arbitrary code  execution. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-29599)    It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values  when processing PDF files. If a user or automated system using ImageMagick  were tricked into opening a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker could  exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu  20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-20224)    Zhang Xiaohui discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain  values when processing image data. If a user or automated system using  ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an  attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only  affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-20241, CVE-2021-20243)    It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values  when processing visual effects based image files.
