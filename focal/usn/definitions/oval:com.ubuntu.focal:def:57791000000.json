		"description": "It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some RPC messages, leading to a buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43945)  Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory allocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to potential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42703)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3524)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3564)  It was discovered that the ISDN implementation of the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3565)  It was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3566)  It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8152 USB Ethernet adapter driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3594)  It was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3621)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5779-1` to fix the vulnerability.
