		"description": "Ilja Van Sprundel discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform size validations on incoming packets in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-3655)  It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764)  It was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)  It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel when preallocating objects for stack maps. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-41864)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be resolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2021-43056)  It was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations that could trigger an array out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43389)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5139-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-oem-5.10-tools-host - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-tools-5.10.0-1051-oem - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-oem-5.10-tools-5.10.0-1051 - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-image-5.10.0-1051-oem - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-oem-5.10-headers-5.10.0-1051 - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-headers-5.10.0-1051-oem - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-modules-5.10.0-1051-oem - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-image-unsigned-5.10.0-1051-oem - 5.10.0-1051.53 linux-buildinfo-5.10.0-1051-oem - 5.10.0-1051.53 No subscription required  linux-oem-20.04 - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-headers-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-tools-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-headers-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-headers-oem-20.04 - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-tools-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-tools-oem-20.04 - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-image-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1051.53 linux-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1051.53 No subscription required",
