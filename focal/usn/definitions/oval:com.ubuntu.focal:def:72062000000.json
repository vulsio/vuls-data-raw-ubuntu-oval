Original advisory details:   Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync  did not properly handle checksum lengths. An attacker could use this  issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-12084)    Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync  compared checksums with uninitialized memory. An attacker could exploit  this issue to leak sensitive information. (CVE-2024-12085)    Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync  incorrectly handled file checksums. A malicious server could use this  to expose arbitrary client files. (CVE-2024-12086)    Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync  mishandled symlinks for some settings. An attacker could exploit this  to write files outside the intended directory. (CVE-2024-12087)    Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync  failed to verify symbolic link destinations for some settings. An  attacker could exploit this for path traversal attacks. (CVE-2024-12088)    Aleksei Gorban discovered a race condition in rsync's handling of  symbolic links. An attacker could use this to access sensitive  information or escalate privileges. (CVE-2024-12747)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7206-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  rsync - 3.1.3-8ubuntu0.9 No subscription required",
