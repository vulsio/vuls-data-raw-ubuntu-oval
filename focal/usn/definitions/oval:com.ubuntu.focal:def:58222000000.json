		"description": "USN-5822-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Samba. The update for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS introduced regressions in certain environments. Pending investigation of these regressions, this update temporarily reverts the security fixes.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Samba incorrectly handled the bad password count  logic. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass bad  passwords lockouts. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 22.10.  (CVE-2021-20251)    Evgeny Legerov discovered that Samba incorrectly handled buffers in  certain GSSAPI routines of Heimdal. A remote attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service.  (CVE-2022-3437)    Tom Tervoort discovered that Samba incorrectly used weak rc4-hmac Kerberos  keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to elevate  privileges. (CVE-2022-37966, CVE-2022-37967)    It was discovered that Samba supported weak RC4/HMAC-MD5 in NetLogon Secure  Channel. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to elevate  privileges. (CVE-2022-38023)    Greg Hudson discovered that Samba incorrectly handled PAC parsing. On  32-bit systems, a remote attacker could use this issue to escalate  privileges, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42898)    Joseph Sutton discovered that Samba could be forced to issue rc4-hmac  encrypted Kerberos tickets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue  to escalate privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and  Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-45141)    WARNING: The fixes included in these updates introduce several important  behavior changes which may cause compatibility problems interacting with  systems still expecting the former behavior.
