(CVE-2016-10033, CVE-2016-10045)  It was discovered that PHPMailer was not properly escaping characters in certain fields of the code_generator.php example code.

(CVE-2017-5223)  Sehun Oh discovered that PHPMailer was not properly processing untrusted non-local file attachments, which could lead to an object injection.
