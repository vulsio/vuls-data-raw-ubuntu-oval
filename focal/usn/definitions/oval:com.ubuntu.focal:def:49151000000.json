		"description": "It was discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the application of file system capabilities with respect to user namespaces. A local attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2021-3493)  Vincent Dehors discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly handle faults in copy_from_user() when passing through ioctls to an underlying file system. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3492)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4915-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.6.0-1054-oem - 5.6.0-1054.58 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.6.0.1054.50 No subscription required",
