		"description": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Android Binder IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20421)  David Leadbeater discovered that the netfilter IRC protocol tracking implementation in the Linux Kernel incorrectly handled certain message payloads in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or bypass firewall filtering. (CVE-2022-2663)  It was discovered that the Intel 740 frame buffer driver in the Linux kernel contained a divide by zero vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3061)  It was discovered that the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3303)  Gwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3586)  It was discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3646)  Hyunwoo Kim discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the PXA3xx graphics driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-39842)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the EFI capsule loader driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-40307)  Zheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang discovered that the RealTek RTL8712U wireless driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4095)  It was discovered that the USB monitoring (usbmon) component in the Linux kernel did not properly set permissions on memory mapped in to user space processes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43750)  Jann Horn discovered a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when unmapping VMAs in certain situations, resulting in possible use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-39188)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5791-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-azure-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1100 - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-cloud-tools-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-azure-headers-5.4.0-1100 - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-headers-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-azure-tools-5.4.0-1100 - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-tools-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-image-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 linux-modules-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106 No subscription required  linux-image-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1100.93 linux-tools-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1100.93 linux-modules-extra-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1100.93 linux-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1100.93 linux-headers-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1100.93 linux-cloud-tools-azure-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1100.93 No subscription required",
