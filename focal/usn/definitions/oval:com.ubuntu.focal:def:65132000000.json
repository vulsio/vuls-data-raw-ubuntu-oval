		"description": "USN-6513-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain plist files.  If a user or an automated system were tricked into processing a specially  crafted plist file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to consume  resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-48564)    It was discovered that Python instances of ssl.SSLSocket were vulnerable  to a bypass of the TLS handshake. An attacker could possibly use this  issue to cause applications to treat unauthenticated received data before  TLS handshake as authenticated data after TLS handshake. (CVE-2023-40217)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6513-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python3.8-minimal - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 python3.8-full - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 libpython3.8-minimal - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 python3.8-examples - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 python3.8-dev - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 libpython3.8-dev - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 python3.8-venv - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 libpython3.8 - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 idle-python3.8 - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 libpython3.8-testsuite - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 libpython3.8-stdlib - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 python3.8 - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 python3.8-doc - 3.8.10-0ubuntu1~20.04.9 No subscription required",
