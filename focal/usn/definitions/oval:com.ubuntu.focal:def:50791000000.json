		"title": "USN-5079-1 -- curl vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when sending data to an MQTT server. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22945)  Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled upgrades to TLS. When receiving certain responses from servers, curl would continue without TLS even when the option to require a successful upgrade to TLS was specified. (CVE-2021-22946)  Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled responses received before STARTTLS. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject responses and intercept communications. (CVE-2021-22947)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5079-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 libcurl3-gnutls - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 libcurl4-doc - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 libcurl3-nss - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 libcurl4 - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 curl - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7 No subscription required",
