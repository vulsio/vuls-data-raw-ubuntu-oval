		"description": "It was discovered that BlueZ did not properly restrict non-bonded devices from injecting HID events into the input subsystem. This could allow a physically proximate attacker to inject keystrokes and execute arbitrary commands whilst the device is discoverable.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6540-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libbluetooth3 - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 bluez-tests - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 bluez-obexd - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 bluetooth - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 bluez - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 bluez-hcidump - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 bluez-cups - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 libbluetooth-dev - 5.53-0ubuntu3.7 No subscription required",
