		"description": "Ziming Zhang and VictorV discovered that the QEMU SLiRP networking implementation incorrectly handled replying to certain ICMP echo requests. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to leak host memory to obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-10756)  Eric Blake and Xueqiang Wei discovered that the QEMU NDB implementation incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-10761)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the QEMU SM501 graphics driver incorrectly handled certain operations. An attacker inside a guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12829)  It was discovered that the QEMU SD memory card implementation incorrectly handled certain memory operations. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-13253)  Ren Ding and Hanqing Zhao discovered that the QEMU ES1370 audio driver incorrectly handled certain invalid frame counts. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-13361)  Ren Ding and Hanqing Zhao discovered that the QEMU MegaRAID SAS SCSI driver incorrectly handled certain memory operations. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-13362)  Alexander Bulekov discovered that QEMU MegaRAID SAS SCSI driver incorrectly handled certain memory space operations. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-13659)  Ren Ding, Hanqing Zhao, Alexander Bulekov, and Anatoly Trosinenko discovered that the QEMU incorrectly handled certain msi-x mmio operations. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-13754)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain memory copy operations when loading ROM contents. If a user were tricked into running an untrusted kernel image, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to run arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-13765)  Ren Ding, Hanqing Zhao, and Yi Ren discovered that the QEMU ATI video driver incorrectly handled certain index values. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-13800)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the QEMU OSS audio driver incorrectly handled certain operations. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-14415)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the QEMU XGMAC Ethernet controller incorrectly handled packet transmission. An attacker inside a guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-15863)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the QEMU e1000e Ethernet controller incorrectly handled packet processing. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-16092)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4467-1` to fix the vulnerability.
