		"description": "Fabian Bäumer, Marcus Brinkmann, Jörg Schwenk discovered that the SSH protocol was vulnerable to a prefix truncation attack. If a remote attacker was able to intercept SSH communications, extension negotiation messages could be truncated, possibly leading to certain algorithms and features being downgraded. This issue is known as the Terrapin attack. This update adds protocol extensions to mitigate this issue.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6598-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python3-paramiko - 2.6.0-2ubuntu0.3 paramiko-doc - 2.6.0-2ubuntu0.3 No subscription required",
