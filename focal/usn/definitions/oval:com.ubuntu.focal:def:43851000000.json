		"description": "It was discovered that memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY read operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly exposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0543)  It was discovered that on some Intel processors, partial data values previously read from a vector register on a physical core may be propagated into unused portions of the store buffer. A local attacker could possible use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0548)  It was discovered that on some Intel processors, data from the most recently evicted modified L1 data cache (L1D) line may be propagated into an unused (invalid) L1D fill buffer. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0549)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4385-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  intel-microcode - 3.20200609.0ubuntu0.20.04.0 No subscription required",
