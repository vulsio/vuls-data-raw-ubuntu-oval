		"description": "Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3609)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce limits for pointer operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33200)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation did not properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24586)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled encrypted fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to decrypt fragments. (CVE-2020-24587)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled certain malformed frames. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious server, a physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-24588)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-25673)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders. A physically proximate attacker could inject malicious packets to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-26139)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation did not properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets. (CVE-2020-26141)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation accepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate  attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation could reassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate  selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)  Or Cohen discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23133)  Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel performed out of bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-29155)  Manfred Paul discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds vulnerability. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-31440)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent speculative loads in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-31829)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4999-1` to fix the vulnerability.
