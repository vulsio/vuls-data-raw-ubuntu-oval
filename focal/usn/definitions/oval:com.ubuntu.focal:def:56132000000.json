		"description": "USN-5613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Vim. Unfortunately that update failed to include binary packages for some architectures. This update fixes that regression.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks  when executing spell suggestion commands. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2022-0943)    It was discovered that Vim was using freed memory when dealing with  regular expressions through its old regular expression engine. If a user  were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could  crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve  code execution. (CVE-2022-1154)    It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing checks on name of  lambda functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service. This issue affected only Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  (CVE-2022-1420)    It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing bounds checks  when processing invalid commands with composing characters in Ex  mode. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of  service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1616)    It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing latin1 data  when issuing Ex commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to  cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1619)    It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing memory  management when dealing with invalid regular expression patterns in  buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of  service. (CVE-2022-1620)    It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing invalid bytes  when performing spell check operations. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2022-1621)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5613-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  vim-common - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-athena - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 xxd - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-gtk - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-gui-common - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-doc - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-tiny - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-runtime - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-gtk3 - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 vim-nox - 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.9 No subscription required",
