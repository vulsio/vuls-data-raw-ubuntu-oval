		"description": "It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly manage HTTP/2 streams. An  attacker could possibly use this to cause Tomcat to consume resources,  resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-11996)  It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly release the HTTP/1.1  processor after the upgrade to HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this to generate an OutOfMemoryException, resulting in a denial of service.  (CVE-2020-13934)  It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly validate the payload length in a WebSocket frame. An attacker could possibly use this to trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-13935)  It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly deserialize untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-9484)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4596-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  tomcat9-docs - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 tomcat9 - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 tomcat9-admin - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 tomcat9-common - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 libtomcat9-java - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 tomcat9-user - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 libtomcat9-embed-java - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 tomcat9-examples - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
