		"description": "Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32233)  Gwangun Jung discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-31436)  Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2023-30456)  It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1380)  Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)  Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)  It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)  Xingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1513)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI TCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)  Jean-Baptiste Cayrou discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling inode locking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2023-2612)  It was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32269)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1118)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6132-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-5.4.0-1064-bluefield - 5.4.0-1064.70 linux-bluefield-tools-5.4.0-1064 - 5.4.0-1064.70 linux-headers-5.4.0-1064-bluefield - 5.4.0-1064.70 linux-bluefield-headers-5.4.0-1064 - 5.4.0-1064.70 linux-tools-5.4.0-1064-bluefield - 5.4.0-1064.70 linux-image-5.4.0-1064-bluefield - 5.4.0-1064.70 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1064-bluefield - 5.4.0-1064.70 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-bluefield - 5.4.0-1064.70 No subscription required  linux-bluefield - 5.4.0.1064.59 linux-tools-bluefield - 5.4.0.1064.59 linux-image-bluefield - 5.4.0.1064.59 linux-headers-bluefield - 5.4.0.1064.59 No subscription required",
