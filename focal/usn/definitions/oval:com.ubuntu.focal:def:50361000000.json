		"description": "It was discovered that Tor incorrectly handled certain memory operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-8955)  It was discovered that Tor did not properly handle the input length to dump_desc() function.

(CVE-2021-28089)  It was discovered that Tor did not properly sanitize the relay nickname in dirvote_add_signatures_to_pending_consensus() function. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause an assertion failure and then cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-28090)  It was discovered that Tor did not properly validate the layer hint on half-open streams. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass the access control, leading to remote code execution. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-34548)  It was discovered that Tor was using an insecure hash function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-34549)  It was discovered that Tor did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted request, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly reading sensitive data. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-34550)  It was discovered that Tor mishandles the relationship between batch-signature verification and single-signature verification. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause an assertion failure and then cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-38385)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5036-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  tor - 0.4.2.7-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 tor-geoipdb - 0.4.2.7-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
