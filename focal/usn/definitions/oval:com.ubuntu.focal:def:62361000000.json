		"description": "It was discovered that ConnMan could be made to write out of bounds. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ConnMan to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-26675, CVE-2021-33833)  It was discovered that ConnMan could be made to leak sensitive information via the gdhcp component. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain information for further exploitation. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-26676)  It was discovered that ConnMan could be made to read out of bounds. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to case ConnMan to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-23096, CVE-2022-23097)  It was discovered that ConnMan could be made to run into an infinite loop. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ConnMan to consume resources and to stop operating, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-23098)  It was discovered that ConnMan could be made to write out of bounds via the gweb component. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ConnMan to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-32292)  It was discovered that ConnMan did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ConnMan to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-32293)  It was discovered that ConnMan could be made to write out of bounds via the gdhcp component. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ConnMan to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-28488)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6236-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  connman - 1.36-2ubuntu0.1 connman-doc - 1.36-2ubuntu0.1 connman-vpn - 1.36-2ubuntu0.1 connman-dev - 1.36-2ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
