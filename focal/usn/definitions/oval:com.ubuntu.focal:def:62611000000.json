		"description": "It was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3090)  Shir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-32629)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3390)  Tanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35001)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6261-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-headers-5.4.0-1018-iot - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-iot - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-image-5.4.0-1018-iot - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-iot-headers-5.4.0-1018 - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-iot-tools-common - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-modules-5.4.0-1018-iot - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1018-iot - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-tools-5.4.0-1018-iot - 5.4.0-1018.19 linux-iot-tools-5.4.0-1018 - 5.4.0-1018.19 No subscription required  linux-tools-iot - 5.4.0.1018.16 linux-headers-iot - 5.4.0.1018.16 linux-iot - 5.4.0.1018.16 linux-image-iot - 5.4.0.1018.16 No subscription required",
