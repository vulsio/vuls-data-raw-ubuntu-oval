		"description": "USN-4916-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Unfortunately, the fix for CVE-2021-3493 introduced a memory leak in some situations. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux kernel did  not properly validate the application of file system capabilities with  respect to user namespaces. A local attacker could use this to gain  elevated privileges. (CVE-2021-3493)   Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF JIT compiler for x86 in the Linux  kernel did not properly validate computation of branch displacements in  some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of  service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-29154)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4916-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.6.0-1055-oem - 5.6.0-1055.59 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.6.0.1055.51 No subscription required",
