		"description": "It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly handle removing a non-existent device id. An attacker with CAP_SYS_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3739)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3743)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3753)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly account for the memory usage of certain IPC objects. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3759)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5117-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1017-oem - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-tools-5.13.0-1017-oem - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-image-5.13.0-1017-oem - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-oem-5.13-headers-5.13.0-1017 - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-buildinfo-5.13.0-1017-oem - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-oem-5.13-tools-host - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-headers-5.13.0-1017-oem - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-modules-5.13.0-1017-oem - 5.13.0-1017.21 linux-oem-5.13-tools-5.13.0-1017 - 5.13.0-1017.21 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1017.21 linux-headers-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1017.21 linux-tools-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1017.21 linux-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1017.21 No subscription required",
