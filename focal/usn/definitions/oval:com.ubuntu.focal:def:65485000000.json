		"description": "It was discovered that Spectre-BHB mitigations were missing for Ampere processors. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-3006)  It was discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition while handling device descriptors in certain situations, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-37453)  Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39189)  Sunjoo Park discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate u32 packets content, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39192)  Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SCTP data, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39193)  Lucas Leong discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle state filters, leading to an out- of-bounds read vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39194)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in certain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42754)  Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5178)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5717)  It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform cryptographic operations in some situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6176)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6548-5` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1028-iot - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-image-5.4.0-1028-iot - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-modules-5.4.0-1028-iot - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-iot-tools-common - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-iot - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-tools-5.4.0-1028-iot - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-iot-headers-5.4.0-1028 - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-headers-5.4.0-1028-iot - 5.4.0-1028.29 linux-iot-tools-5.4.0-1028 - 5.4.0-1028.29 No subscription required  linux-iot - 5.4.0.1028.26 linux-tools-iot - 5.4.0.1028.26 linux-headers-iot - 5.4.0.1028.26 linux-image-iot - 5.4.0.1028.26 No subscription required",
