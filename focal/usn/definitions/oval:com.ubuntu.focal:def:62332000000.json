		"description": "USN-6233-1 fixed vulnerabilities in YAJL. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that YAJL was not properly performing bounds checks when  decoding a string with escape sequences. If a user or automated system  using YAJL were tricked into processing specially crafted input, an  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service  (application abort). (CVE-2017-16516)    It was discovered that YAJL was not properly handling memory allocation  when dealing with large inputs, which could lead to heap memory  corruption. If a user or automated system using YAJL were tricked into  running a specially crafted large input, an attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-24795)    It was discovered that memory leaks existed in one of the YAJL parsing  functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of  service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-33460)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6233-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  yajl-tools - 2.1.0-3ubuntu0.20.04.1 libyajl-doc - 2.1.0-3ubuntu0.20.04.1 libyajl-dev - 2.1.0-3ubuntu0.20.04.1 libyajl2 - 2.1.0-3ubuntu0.20.04.1 No subscription required",
