		"description": "USN-6744-1 fixed a vulnerability in Pillow (Python 3). This update provides the corresponding updates for Pillow (Python 2) in  Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  Original advisory details:   Hugo van Kemenade discovered that Pillow was not properly performing   bounds checks when processing an ICC file, which could lead to a buffer  overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a   specially crafted ICC file, an attacker could possibly use this issue   to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6744-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-pil - 6.2.1-3ubuntu0.1~esm2 python-pil.imagetk - 6.2.1-3ubuntu0.1~esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
