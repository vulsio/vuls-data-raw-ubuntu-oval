Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Pillow incorrectly handled certain image files. If  a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-crafted  image file, a remote attacker could possibly cause Pillow to crash,  resulting in a denial of service.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4430-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python3-pil.imagetk - 7.0.0-4ubuntu0.1 python-pil-doc - 7.0.0-4ubuntu0.1 python3-pil - 7.0.0-4ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
