		"description": "Ilja Van Sprundel discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform size validations on incoming packets in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-3655)  It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764)  It was discovered that the Aspeed Low Pin Count (LPC) Bus Controller implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform boundary checks in some situations, allowing out-of-bounds write access. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. In Ubuntu, this issue only affected systems running armhf kernels. (CVE-2021-42252)  Jann Horn discovered that the SELinux subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle subjective credentials for tasks in some situations. On systems where SELinux has been enabled, a local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43057)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5162-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-buildinfo-5.13.0-1020-oem - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-image-5.13.0-1020-oem - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-oem-5.13-tools-host - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1020-oem - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-oem-5.13-tools-5.13.0-1020 - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-headers-5.13.0-1020-oem - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-oem-5.13-headers-5.13.0-1020 - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-modules-5.13.0-1020-oem - 5.13.0-1020.24 linux-tools-5.13.0-1020-oem - 5.13.0-1020.24 No subscription required  linux-headers-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1020.24 linux-image-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1020.24 linux-tools-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1020.24 linux-oem-20.04c - 5.13.0.1020.24 No subscription required",
