		"description": "USN-5523-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in LibTIFF. This update provides the fixes for CVE-2022-0907, CVE-2022-0908, CVE-2022-0909, CVE-2022-0924 and CVE-2022-22844 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly perf   orming checks to  guarantee that allocated memory space existed, which could lead to a  NULL pointer dereference via a specially crafted file. An attacker  could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2022-0907, CVE-2022-0908)    It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to  avoid division calculations where the denominator value was zero,  which could lead to an undefined behavior situation via a specially  crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service. (CVE-2022-0909)    It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing bounds  checks, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially  crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service or to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0924)    It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing the  calculation of data that would eventually be used as a reference for  bounds checking operations, which could lead to an out-of-bounds  read via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive  information. (CVE-2020-19131)    It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly terminating a  function execution when processing incorrect data, which could lead  to an out-of-bounds read via a specially crafted file. An attacker  could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to  expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-19144)    It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks  when setting the value for data later used as reference during memory  access, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially  crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service or to expose sensitive information.  (CVE-2022-22844)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5523-2` to fix the vulnerability.
