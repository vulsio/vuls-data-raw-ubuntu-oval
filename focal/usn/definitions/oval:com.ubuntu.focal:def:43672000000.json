		"title": "USN-4367-2 -- Linux kernel regression",
		"description": "USN-4367-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the 5.4 Linux kernel. Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression in overlayfs. This update corrects the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not  properly detect that a block was marked dirty in some situations. An  attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when  unmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19377)   It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain  mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker  with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial  of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)   It was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race  condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could  possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute  arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4367-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.4.0-33-generic - 5.4.0-33.37 linux-image-5.4.0-33-lowlatency - 5.4.0-33.37 linux-image-5.4.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-33.37 No subscription required  linux-image-virtual-hwe-20.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-20.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic-lpae - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-virtual-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-oem - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic-hwe-20.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-20.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-oem-osp1 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-lowlatency - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-generic-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-virtual-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.33.38 linux-image-virtual - 5.4.0.33.38 No subscription required",
