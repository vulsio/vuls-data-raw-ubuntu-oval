		"description": "It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain scripts. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash. (CVE-2022-48560)  It was discovered that Python did not properly handle XML entity declarations in plist files. An attacker could possibly use this vulnerability to perform an XML External Entity (XXE) injection, resulting in a denial of service or information disclosure. (CVE-2022-48565)  It was discovered that Python did not properly provide constant-time processing for a crypto operation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a timing attack and recover sensitive information. (CVE-2022-48566)  It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain inputs. If a user or an automated system were tricked into running a specially crafted input, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-24329)  It was discovered that Python instances of ssl.SSLSocket were vulnerable to a bypass of the TLS handshake. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause applications to treat unauthenticated received data before TLS handshake as authenticated data after TLS handshake. (CVE-2023-40217)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7180-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  idle-python2.7 - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 libpython2.7 - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 libpython2.7-dev - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 libpython2.7-minimal - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 libpython2.7-stdlib - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 libpython2.7-testsuite - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 python2.7 - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 python2.7-dev - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 python2.7-doc - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 python2.7-examples - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 python2.7-minimal - 2.7.18-1~20.04.7 No subscription required",
