		"description": "Ramin Farajpour Cami discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled certain malformed unix socket names. A remote attacker could exploit this with a crafted socket name, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-20839)  It was discovered that LibVNCServer did not properly access byte-aligned data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-20840)  Christian Beier discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled anonymous TLS connections.
