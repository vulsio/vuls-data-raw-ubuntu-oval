		"description": "It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some RPC messages, leading to a buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43945)  Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory allocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to potential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42703)  Roger Pau Monn√© discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)  Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen network device frontend driver in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled socket buffers (skb) references when communicating with certain backends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2022-33743)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3524)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3564)  It was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3566)  It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8152 USB Ethernet adapter driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3594)  It was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3621)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5789-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-tools-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-image-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-modules-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-headers-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-oem-5.14-tools-5.14.0-1055 - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-buildinfo-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-oem-5.14-headers-5.14.0-1055 - 5.14.0-1055.62 linux-oem-5.14-tools-host - 5.14.0-1055.62 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-image-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-headers-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-tools-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-tools-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-tools-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-headers-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-headers-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-headers-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-tools-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1055.53 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1055.53 No subscription required",
