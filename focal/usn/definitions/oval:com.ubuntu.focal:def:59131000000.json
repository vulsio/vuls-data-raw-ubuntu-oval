		"description": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in certain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)  Lee Jones discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20566)  It was discovered that the ISDN implementation of the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3565)  It was discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36879)  It was discovered that the USB monitoring (usbmon) component in the Linux kernel did not properly set permissions on memory mapped in to user space processes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43750)  It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4379)  It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-47520)  Jos√© Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5913-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-oem-5.14-headers-5.14.0-1058 - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-headers-5.14.0-1058-oem - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-buildinfo-5.14.0-1058-oem - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-oem-5.14-tools-5.14.0-1058 - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-modules-5.14.0-1058-oem - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1058-oem - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-image-5.14.0-1058-oem - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-modules-iwlwifi-5.14.0-1058-oem - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-tools-5.14.0-1058-oem - 5.14.0-1058.66 linux-oem-5.14-tools-host - 5.14.0-1058.66 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-image-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-headers-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-tools-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-tools-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-image-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-tools-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-headers-oem-20.04b - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-headers-oem-20.04c - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-headers-oem-20.04d - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-tools-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1058.56 linux-modules-iwlwifi-oem-20.04 - 5.14.0.1058.56 No subscription required",
