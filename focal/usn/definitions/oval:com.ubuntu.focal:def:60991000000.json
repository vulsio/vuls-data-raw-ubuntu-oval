		"description": "It was discovered that ncurses was incorrectly performing bounds checks when processing invalid hashcodes. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-17594)  It was discovered that ncurses was incorrectly handling end-of-string characters when processing terminfo and termcap files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-17595)  It was discovered that ncurses was incorrectly handling end-of-string characters when converting between termcap and terminfo formats. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-39537)  It was discovered that ncurses was incorrectly performing bounds checks when dealing with corrupt terminfo data while reading a terminfo file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-29458)  It was discovered that ncurses was parsing environment variables when running with setuid applications and not properly handling the processing of malformed data when doing so. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-29491)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6099-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ncurses-examples - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib32ncurses-dev - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib32ncursesw6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libtinfo-dev - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libncursesw5 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libtinfo5 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libtinfo6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib32tinfo6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib32ncurses6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libncurses5-dev - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib64tinfo6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 ncurses-bin - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib64ncurses6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libncurses-dev - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libncurses6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libncurses5 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 ncurses-base - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 ncurses-doc - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib64ncurses-dev - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 ncurses-term - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libncursesw6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 libncursesw5-dev - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 lib64ncursesw6 - 6.2-0ubuntu2.1 No subscription required",
