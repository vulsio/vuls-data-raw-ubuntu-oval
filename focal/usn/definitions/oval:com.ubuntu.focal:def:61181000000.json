		"description": "Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)  Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)  It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)  Xingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1513)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI TCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)  It was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32269)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1118)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6118-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-headers-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-oracle-tools-5.4.0-1101 - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-tools-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-oracle-headers-5.4.0-1101 - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-modules-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110 linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110 No subscription required  linux-tools-oracle-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1101.94 linux-image-oracle-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1101.94 linux-headers-oracle-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1101.94 linux-oracle-lts-20.04 - 5.4.0.1101.94 No subscription required",
