		"description": "Ryota Shiga discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify that a BPF program only reserved as much memory for a ring buffer as was allocated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3489)  Manfred Paul discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly track bounds on bitwise operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3490)  Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong discovered that the io_uring implementation of the Linux kernel did not properly enforce the MAX_RW_COUNT limit in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3491)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)  It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-28688)  It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a deadlock condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-28951)  John Stultz discovered that the audio driver for Qualcomm SDM845 systems in the Linux kernel did not properly validate port ID numbers. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28952)  Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)  Vince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell processors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)  It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28972)  It was discovered that the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver for the Linux kernel did not properly handle receive queue overrun when jumbo frames were enabled in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29264)  It was discovered that the vDPA backend virtio driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-29266)  It was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate passed encryption key sizes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29646)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-29647)  It was discovered that the BPF user mode driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-29649)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)  Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel for AMD processors contained race conditions on nested VMCB controls. A local attacker in a guest vm could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2021-29657)  Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)  马哲宇 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4948-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.10.0-1026-oem - 5.10.0-1026.27 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-20.04b - 5.10.0.1026.27 linux-image-oem-20.04-edge - 5.10.0.1026.27 No subscription required",
