		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/bridge: lt8912b: Fix crash on bridge detach The lt8912b driver, in itsbridge detach function, calls drm_connector_unregister() anddrm_connector_cleanup(). drm_connector_unregister() should be called onlyfor connectors explicitly registered with drm_connector_register(), whichis not the case in lt8912b. The driver's drm_connector_funcs.destroy hookis set to drm_connector_cleanup(). Thus the driver should not call eitherdrm_connector_unregister() nor drm_connector_cleanup() in itslt8912_bridge_detach(), as they cause a crash on bridge detach: Unable tohandle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000Mem abort info: ESR = 0x0000000096000006 EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL =32 bits SET = 0, FnV = 0 EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 FSC = 0x06: level 2 translationfault Data abort info: ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000006, ISS2 = 0x00000000 CM = 0,WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0 GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=00000000858f3000[0000000000000000] pgd=0800000085918003, p4d=0800000085918003,pud=0800000085431003, pmd=0000000000000000 Internal error: Oops:0000000096000006 [#1] PREEMPT SMP Modules linked in: tidss(-)display_connector lontium_lt8912b tc358768 panel_lvds panel_simpledrm_dma_helper drm_kms_helper drm drm_panel_orientation_quirks CPU: 3 PID:462 Comm: rmmod Tainted: G W 6.5.0-rc2+ #2 Hardware name: Toradex VerdinAM62 on Verdin Development Board (DT) pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO-TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) pc : drm_connector_cleanup+0x78/0x2d4 [drm] lr :lt8912_bridge_detach+0x54/0x6c [lontium_lt8912b] sp : ffff800082ed3a90 x29:ffff800082ed3a90 x28: ffff0000040c1940 x27: 0000000000000000 x26:0000000000000000 x25: dead000000000122 x24: dead000000000122 x23:dead000000000100 x22: ffff000003fb6388 x21: 0000000000000000 x20:0000000000000000 x19: ffff000003fb6260 x18: fffffffffffe56e8 x17:0000000000000000 x16: 0010000000000000 x15: 0000000000000038 x14:0000000000000000 x13: ffff800081914b48 x12: 000000000000040e x11:000000000000015a x10: ffff80008196ebb8 x9 : ffff800081914b48 x8 :00000000ffffefff x7 : ffff0000040c1940 x6 : ffff80007aa649d0 x5 :0000000000000000 x4 : 0000000000000001 x3 : ffff80008159e008 x2 :0000000000000000 x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : 0000000000000000 Call trace:drm_connector_cleanup+0x78/0x2d4 [drm] lt8912_bridge_detach+0x54/0x6c[lontium_lt8912b] drm_bridge_detach+0x44/0x84 [drm]drm_encoder_cleanup+0x40/0xb8 [drm] drmm_encoder_alloc_release+0x1c/0x30[drm] drm_managed_release+0xac/0x148 [drm] drm_dev_put.part.0+0x88/0xb8[drm] devm_drm_dev_init_release+0x14/0x24 [drm]devm_action_release+0x14/0x20 release_nodes+0x5c/0x90devres_release_all+0x8c/0xe0 device_unbind_cleanup+0x18/0x68device_release_driver_internal+0x208/0x23c driver_detach+0x4c/0x94bus_remove_driver+0x70/0xf4 driver_unregister+0x30/0x60platform_driver_unregister+0x14/0x20 tidss_platform_driver_exit+0x18/0xb2c[tidss] __arm64_sys_delete_module+0x1a0/0x2b4 invoke_syscall+0x48/0x110el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x60/0x10c do_el0_svc_compat+0x1c/0x40el0_svc_compat+0x40/0xac el0t_32_sync_handler+0xb0/0x138el0t_32_sync+0x194/0x198 Code: 9104a276 f2fbd5b7 aa0203e1 91008af8(f85c0420)",
