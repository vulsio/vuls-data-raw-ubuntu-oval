		"Title": "CVE-2022-27666 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c and net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat. It was discovered that the IPsec implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate enough memory when performing ESP transformations, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-27666` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-generic - 5.4.0-107.121\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-107.121\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-107-generic -
