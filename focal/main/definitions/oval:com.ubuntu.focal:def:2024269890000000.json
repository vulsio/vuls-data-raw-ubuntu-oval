Such MEMBLOCK_NOMAP regionsshould not be saved during hibernation.This problem was introduced by changes to the pfn_valid() logic incommit a7d9f306ba70 (\"arm64: drop pfn_valid_within() and simplifypfn_valid()\").Similar to other architectures, drop the !can_set_direct_map() check inkernel_page_present() so that page_is_savable() skips such pages.[catalin.marinas@arm.com: rework commit message]",
