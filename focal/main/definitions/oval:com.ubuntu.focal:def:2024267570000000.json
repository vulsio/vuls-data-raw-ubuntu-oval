		"title": "CVE-2024-26757 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: md:Don't ignore read-only array in md_check_recovery() Usually if the array isnot read-write, md_check_recovery() won't register new sync_thread in thefirst place. And if the array is read-write and sync_thread is registered,md_set_readonly() will unregister sync_thread before setting the arrayread-only. md/raid follow this behavior hence there is no problem. Aftercommit f52f5c71f3d4 (\"md: fix stopping sync thread\"), following hang can betriggered by test shell/integrity-caching.sh: 1) array is read-only.dm-raid update super block: rs_update_sbs ro = mddev->ro mddev->ro = 0 ->set array read-write md_update_sb 2) register new sync thread concurrently.3) dm-raid set array back to read-only: rs_update_sbs mddev->ro = ro 4)stop the array: raid_dtr md_stop stop_sync_thread set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_INTR,&mddev->recovery); md_wakeup_thread_directly(mddev->sync_thread);wait_event(..., !test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery)) 5) syncthread done: md_do_sync set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_DONE, &mddev->recovery);md_wakeup_thread(mddev->thread); 6) daemon thread can't unregister syncthread: md_check_recovery if (!md_is_rdwr(mddev) &&!test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED, &mddev->recovery)) return; -> ->MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING can't be cleared, hence step 4 hang; The root cause isthat dm-raid manipulate 'mddev->ro' by itself, however, dm-raid reallyshould stop sync thread before setting the array read-only. Unfortunately,I need to read more code before I can refacter the handler of 'mddev->ro'in dm-raid, hence let's fix the problem the easy way for now to preventdm-raid regression.",
