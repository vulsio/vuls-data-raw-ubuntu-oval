To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should bealive when calling lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and movessock_put and ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe totry to hold the ep under rcu_read_lock insctp_transport_traverse_process(). If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, itmeans this ep is still alive and we have held it and can continue to dumpit; If it returns false, it means this ep is dead and can be freed afterrcu_read_unlock, and we should skip it. In sctp_sock_dump(), after lockingthe sk, if this ep is different from tsp->asoc->ep, it means during thisdumping, this asoc was peeled off before calling lock_sock(), and the skshould be skipped; If this ep is the same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means nopeeloff happens on this asoc, and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happeneither until release_sock. Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay theport release, as the port release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() beforecalling call_rcu(). Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe toaccess the sk by asoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().Thanks Jones to bring this issue up. v1->v2: - improve the changelog. - addkfree(ep) into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46929` to fix the vulnerability.
