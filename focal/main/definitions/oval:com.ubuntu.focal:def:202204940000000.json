		"Title": "CVE-2022-0494 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "A kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with confidentiality. It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0494` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-bluefield - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-kvm - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1033-oem - 5.14.0-1033.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1068-raspi - 5.4.0-1068.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-bluefield - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-kvm - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1033-oem - 5.14.0-1033.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
