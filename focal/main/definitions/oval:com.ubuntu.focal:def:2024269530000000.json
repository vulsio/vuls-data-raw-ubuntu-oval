		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:esp: fix bad handling of pages from page_pool When the skb is reorganizedduring esp_output (!esp->inline), the pages coming from the original skbfragments are supposed to be released back to the system through put_page.But if the skb fragment pages are originating from a page_pool, callingput_page on them will trigger a page_pool leak which will eventually resultin a crash. This leak can be easily observed when using CONFIG_DEBUG_VM anddoing ipsec + gre (non offloaded) forwarding: BUG: Bad page state inprocess ksoftirqd/16 pfn:1451b6 page:00000000de2b8d32 refcount:0 mapcount:0mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x1451b6000 pfn:0x1451b6 flags:0x200000000000000(node=0|zone=2) page_type: 0xffffffff() raw:0200000000000000 dead000000000040 ffff88810d23c000 0000000000000000 raw:00000001451b6000 0000000000000001 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000 pagedumped because: page_pool leak Modules linked in: ip_gre gre mlx5_ibmlx5_core xt_conntrack xt_MASQUERADE nf_conntrack_netlink nfnetlinkiptable_nat nf_nat xt_addrtype br_netfilter rpcrdma rdma_ucm ib_iserlibiscsi scsi_transport_iscsi ib_umad rdma_cm ib_ipoib iw_cm ib_cmib_uverbs ib_core overlay zram zsmalloc fuse [last unloaded: mlx5_core]CPU: 16 PID: 96 Comm: ksoftirqd/16 Not tainted 6.8.0-rc4+ #22 Hardwarename: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOSrel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014 Call Trace: <TASK>dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50 bad_page+0x70/0xf0free_unref_page_prepare+0x27a/0x460 free_unref_page+0x38/0x120esp_ssg_unref.isra.0+0x15f/0x200 esp_output_tail+0x66d/0x780esp_xmit+0x2c5/0x360 validate_xmit_xfrm+0x313/0x370 ?validate_xmit_skb+0x1d/0x330 validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x70sch_direct_xmit+0x23e/0x350 __dev_queue_xmit+0x337/0xba0 ?nf_hook_slow+0x3f/0xd0 ip_finish_output2+0x25e/0x580iptunnel_xmit+0x19b/0x240 ip_tunnel_xmit+0x5fb/0xb60 ipgre_xmit+0x14d/0x280[ip_gre] dev_hard_start_xmit+0xc3/0x1c0 __dev_queue_xmit+0x208/0xba0 ?nf_hook_slow+0x3f/0xd0 ip_finish_output2+0x1ca/0x580ip_sublist_rcv_finish+0x32/0x40 ip_sublist_rcv+0x1b2/0x1f0 ?ip_rcv_finish_core.constprop.0+0x460/0x460 ip_list_rcv+0x103/0x130__netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x181/0x1e0netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x1b3/0x2c0 napi_gro_receive+0xc8/0x200gro_cell_poll+0x52/0x90 __napi_poll+0x25/0x1a0 net_rx_action+0x28e/0x300__do_softirq+0xc3/0x276 ? sort_range+0x20/0x20 run_ksoftirqd+0x1e/0x30smpboot_thread_fn+0xa6/0x130 kthread+0xcd/0x100 ?kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20 ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50 ?kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20 ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20 </TASK> Thesuggested fix is to introduce a new wrapper (skb_page_unref) that coverspage refcounting for page_pool pages as well.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26953` to fix the vulnerability.
