		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: fix locking for Tx timestamp tracking flushCommit 4dd0d5c33c3e (\"ice: add lock around Tx timestamp tracker flush\")added a lock around the Tx timestamp tracker flow which is used tocleanup any left over SKBs and prepare for device removal.This lock is problematic because it is being held around a call toice_clear_phy_tstamp. The clear function takes a mutex to send a PHYwrite command to firmware. This could lead to a deadlock if the mutexactually sleeps, and causes the following warning on a kernel withpreemption debugging enabled:[  715.419426] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context atkernel/locking/mutex.c:573[  715.427900] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 3100,name: rmmod[  715.435652] INFO: lockdep is turned off.[  715.439591] Preemption disabled at:[  715.439594] [<0000000000000000>] 0x0[  715.446678] CPU: 52 PID: 3100 Comm: rmmod Tainted: G        W  OE5.15.0-rc4+ #42 bdd7ec3018e725f159ca0d372ce8c2c0e784891c[  715.458058] Hardware name: Intel Corporation S2600STQ/S2600STQ, BIOSSE5C620.86B.02.01.0010.010620200716 01/06/2020[  715.468483] Call Trace:[  715.470940]  dump_stack_lvl+0x6a/0x9a[  715.474613]  ___might_sleep.cold+0x224/0x26a[  715.478895]  __mutex_lock+0xb3/0x1440[  715.482569]  ? stack_depot_save+0x378/0x500[  715.486763]  ? ice_sq_send_cmd+0x78/0x14c0 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.494979]  ? kfree+0xc1/0x520[  715.498128]  ? mutex_lock_io_nested+0x12a0/0x12a0[  715.502837]  ? kasan_set_free_info+0x20/0x30[  715.507110]  ? __kasan_slab_free+0x10b/0x140[  715.511385]  ? slab_free_freelist_hook+0xc7/0x220[  715.516092]  ? kfree+0xc1/0x520[  715.519235]  ? ice_deinit_lag+0x16c/0x220 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.527359]  ? ice_remove+0x1cf/0x6a0 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.535133]  ? pci_device_remove+0xab/0x1d0[  715.539318]  ? __device_release_driver+0x35b/0x690[  715.544110]  ? driver_detach+0x214/0x2f0[  715.548035]  ? bus_remove_driver+0x11d/0x2f0[  715.552309]  ? pci_unregister_driver+0x26/0x250[  715.556840]  ? ice_module_exit+0xc/0x2f [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.564799]  ? __do_sys_delete_module.constprop.0+0x2d8/0x4e0[  715.570554]  ? do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90[  715.574303]  ? entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae[  715.579529]  ? start_flush_work+0x542/0x8f0[  715.583719]  ? ice_sq_send_cmd+0x78/0x14c0 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.591923]  ice_sq_send_cmd+0x78/0x14c0 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.599960]  ? wait_for_completion_io+0x250/0x250[  715.604662]  ? lock_acquire+0x196/0x200[  715.608504]  ? do_raw_spin_trylock+0xa5/0x160[  715.612864]  ice_sbq_rw_reg+0x1e6/0x2f0 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.620813]  ? ice_reset+0x130/0x130 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.628497]  ? __debug_check_no_obj_freed+0x1e8/0x3c0[  715.633550]  ? trace_hardirqs_on+0x1c/0x130[  715.637748]  ice_write_phy_reg_e810+0x70/0xf0 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.646220]  ? do_raw_spin_trylock+0xa5/0x160[  715.650581]  ? ice_ptp_release+0x910/0x910 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.658797]  ? ice_ptp_release+0x255/0x910 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.667013]  ice_clear_phy_tstamp+0x2c/0x110 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.675403]  ice_ptp_release+0x408/0x910 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.683440]  ice_remove+0x560/0x6a0 [ice9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d][  715.691037]  ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x46/0x73[  715.696005]  pci_device_remove+0xab/0x1d0[  715.700018]  __device_release_driver+0x35b/0x690[  715.704637]  driver_detach+0x214/0x2f0[  715.708389]  bus_remove_driver+0x11d/0x2f0[  715.712489]  pci_unregister_driver+0x26/0x250[  71---truncated---",
