		"description": "The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to supportencrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line toolfor use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcryptfunction `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current usedis authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user fromrunning an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system.In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with aManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not thefirst one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list wastested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could notbe run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailablelayers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failurewould occur later due to the layers not being available. However, thisverdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in theManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image hadpreviously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4.Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24778` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncontainerd - 1.5.9-0ubuntu1~20.04.6\nNo subscription required",
