		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_mpls: Fix warning during failed attribute validationThe 'TCA_MPLS_LABEL' attribute is of 'NLA_U32' type, but has avalidation type of 'NLA_VALIDATE_FUNCTION'. This is an invalidcombination according to the comment above 'struct nla_policy':\"Meaning of `validate' field, use via NLA_POLICY_VALIDATE_FN:   NLA_BINARY           Validation function called for the attribute.   All other            Unused - but note that it's a union\"This can trigger the warning [1] in nla_get_range_unsigned() whenvalidation of the attribute fails. Despite being of 'NLA_U32' type, theassociated 'min'/'max' fields in the policy are negative as they arealiased by the 'validate' field.Fix by changing the attribute type to 'NLA_BINARY' which is consistentwith the above comment and all other users of NLA_POLICY_VALIDATE_FN().As a result, move the length validation to the validation function.No regressions in MPLS tests: # ./tdc.py -f tc-tests/actions/mpls.json [...] # echo $? 0[1]WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 17743 at lib/nlattr.c:118nla_get_range_unsigned+0x1d8/0x1e0 lib/nlattr.c:117Modules linked in:CPU: 0 PID: 17743 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted 6.1.0-rc8 #3Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOSrel-1.13.0-48-gd9c812dda519-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:nla_get_range_unsigned+0x1d8/0x1e0 lib/nlattr.c:117[...]Call Trace: <TASK> __netlink_policy_dump_write_attr+0x23d/0x990 net/netlink/policy.c:310 netlink_policy_dump_write_attr+0x22/0x30 net/netlink/policy.c:411 netlink_ack_tlv_fill net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2454 [inline] netlink_ack+0x546/0x760 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2506 netlink_rcv_skb+0x1b7/0x240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2546 rtnetlink_rcv+0x18/0x20 net/core/rtnetlink.c:6109 netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1319 [inline] netlink_unicast+0x5e9/0x6b0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1345 netlink_sendmsg+0x739/0x860 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1921 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:714 [inline] sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:734 [inline] ____sys_sendmsg+0x38f/0x500 net/socket.c:2482 ___sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2536 [inline] __sys_sendmsg+0x197/0x230 net/socket.c:2565 __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2574 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2572 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x42/0x50 net/socket.c:2572 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x2b/0x70 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52906` to fix the vulnerability.
