		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: misc:alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge There is an issuewith the ASPM(optional) capability checking function. A device might beattached to root complex directly, in this case, bus->self(bridge) will beNULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL. Sincealcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's ASPMcapability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later byalcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can dohere is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply returnwhen bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.
