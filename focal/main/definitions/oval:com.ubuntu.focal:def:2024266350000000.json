		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: llc:Drop support for ETH_P_TR_802_2. syzbot reported an uninit-value bug below.[0] llc supports ETH_P_802_2 (0x0004) and used to support ETH_P_TR_802_2(0x0011), and syzbot abused the latter to trigger the bug. write$tun(r0,&(0x7f0000000040)={@val={0x0, 0x11}, @val, @mpls={[], @llc={@snap={0xaa,0x1, ')', \"90e5dd\"}}}}, 0x16) llc_conn_handler() initialises localvariables {saddr,daddr}.mac based on skb inllc_pdu_decode_sa()/llc_pdu_decode_da() and passes them to __llc_lookup().However, the initialisation is done only when skb->protocol ishtons(ETH_P_802_2), otherwise, __llc_lookup_established() and__llc_lookup_listener() will read garbage. The missing initialisationexisted prior to commit 211ed865108e (\"net: delete all instances of specialprocessing for token ring\"). It removed the part to kick out the token ringstuff but forgot to close the door allowing ETH_P_TR_802_2 packets to sneakinto llc_rcv(). Let's remove llc_tr_packet_type and complete thedeprecation.
