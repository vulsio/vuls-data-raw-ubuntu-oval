    "Title": "CVE-2021-25329 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41, 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 or 7.0.0. to 7.0.107 with a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be used, the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494. Note that both the previously published prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and the previously published mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to this issue.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-25329` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtomcat9-embed-java - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.2\nlibtomcat9-java - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.2\ntomcat9 - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.2\ntomcat9-admin - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.2\ntomcat9-common - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.2\ntomcat9-examples - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.2\ntomcat9-user - 9.0.31-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
