		"Description": "In ion_buffer_kmap_get of ion.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-205573273References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the Ion Memory Manager subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability.
