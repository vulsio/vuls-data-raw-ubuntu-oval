		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slub: actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoning It turns out that SLUBredzoning (\"slub_debug=Z\") checks from s->object_size rather than froms->inuse (which is normally bumped to make room for the freelist pointer),so a cache created with an object size less than 24 would have the freelistpointer written beyond s->object_size, causing the redzone to be corruptedby the freelist pointer. This was very visible with \"slub_debug=ZF\": BUGtest (Tainted: G B ): Right Redzone overwritten-----------------------------------------------------------------------------INFO: 0xffff957ead1c05de-0xffff957ead1c05df @offset=1502.
