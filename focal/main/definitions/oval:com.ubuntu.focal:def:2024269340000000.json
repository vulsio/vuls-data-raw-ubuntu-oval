		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface() Among the attribute filecallback routines in drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c, theinterface_authorized_store() function is the only one which acquires adevice lock on an ancestor device: It calls usb_deauthorize_interface(),which locks the interface's parent USB device. The will lead to deadlock ifanother process already owns that lock and tries to remove the interface,whether through a configuration change or because the device has beendisconnected. As part of the removal procedure, device_del() waits for allongoing sysfs attribute callbacks to complete. Butusb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete until the device lock has beenreleased, and the lock won't be released until the removal has finished.The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is to usethe sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs not to waitfor the attribute callback.
