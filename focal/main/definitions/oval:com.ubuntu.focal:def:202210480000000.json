		"Title": "CVE-2022-1048 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s sound subsystem in the way a user triggers concurrent calls of PCM hw_params. The hw_free ioctls or similar race condition happens inside ALSA PCM for other ioctls. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Hu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1048` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-bluefield - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-kvm - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1033-oem - 5.14.0-1033.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1068-raspi - 5.4.0-1068.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-bluefield - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-kvm - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1033-oem - 5.14.0-1033.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required",
