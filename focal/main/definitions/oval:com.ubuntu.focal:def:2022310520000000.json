		"description": "Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chatnetwork. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages canexhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unboundedrecursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for therequest causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process maycrash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either bymalicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that alocal user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remoteusers are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL previewendpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false`set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with`url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected.Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` arenot affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeserverswith URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher.Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.",
