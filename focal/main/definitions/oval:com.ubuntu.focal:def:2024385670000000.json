While therewas a check for a specific 4th endpoint, since it can switch typesbetween bulk and interrupt, other endpoints are trusted implicitly.Similar warning is triggered in a couple of other syzbot issues [2].Fix the issue by doing a comprehensive check of all endpointstaking into account difference between high- and full-speedconfiguration.[1] Syzkaller report:...WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 4721 at drivers/usb/core/urb.c:504usb_submit_urb+0xed6/0x1880 drivers/usb/core/urb.c:504...Call Trace: <TASK> carl9170_usb_send_rx_irq_urb+0x273/0x340drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:504 carl9170_usb_init_device drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:939[inline] carl9170_usb_firmware_finish drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:999[inline] carl9170_usb_firmware_step2+0x175/0x240drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:1028 request_firmware_work_func+0x130/0x240drivers/base/firmware_loader/main.c:1107 process_one_work+0x9bf/0x1710 kernel/workqueue.c:2289 worker_thread+0x669/0x1090 kernel/workqueue.c:2436 kthread+0x2e8/0x3a0 kernel/kthread.c:376 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:308 </TASK>[2] Related syzkaller crashes:",
