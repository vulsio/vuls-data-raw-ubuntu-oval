		"Title": "CVE-2023-20928 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "In binder_vma_close of binder.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-254837884References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-20928` to fix the vulnerability.
