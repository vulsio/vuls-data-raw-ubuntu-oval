		"Title": "CVE-2021-33655 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "When sending malicous data to kernel by ioctl cmd FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO,kernel will write memory out of bounds. It was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of- bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33655` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-aws - 5.15.0-1020.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-azure - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-bluefield - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-gcp - 5.15.0-1018.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-gke - 5.4.0-1083.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gke - 5.15.0-1016.19~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gkeop - 5.4.0-1053.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1016.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-kvm - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1049-oem - 5.14.0-1049.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-oracle - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1070-raspi - 5.4.0-1070.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-aws - 5.15.0-1020.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-azure - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-bluefield - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-gcp - 5.15.0-1018.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-gke - 5.4.0-1083.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gke - 5.15.0-1016.19~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gkeop - 5.4.0-1053.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1016.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-kvm - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1049-oem - 5.14.0-1049.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-oracle - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
