		"Title": "CVE-2023-4692 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue may allow an attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS filesystem image, leading to grub's heap metadata corruption. In some circumstances, the attack may also corrupt the UEFI firmware heap metadata. As a result, arbitrary code execution and secure boot protection bypass may be achieved. It was discovered that a specially crafted file system image could cause a heap-based out-of-bounds write. An attacker could potentially use this to perform arbitrary code execution bypass and bypass secure boot protections.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4692` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.187.6~20.04.1\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.187.6~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\nNo subscription required",
