    "Title": "CVE-2023-3159 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "A use after free issue was discovered in driver/firewire in outbound_phy_packet_callback in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with special privilege may cause a use after free problem when queue_event() fails. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3159` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic -
