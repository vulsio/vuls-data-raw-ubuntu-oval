		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/entry: Clear X86_FEATURE_SMAP when CONFIG_X86_SMAP=nCommit  3c73b81a9164 (\"x86/entry, selftests: Further improve user entry sanitychecks\")added a warning if AC is set when in the kernel.Commit  662a0221893a3d (\"x86/entry: Fix AC assertion\")changed the warning to only fire if the CPU supports SMAP.However, the warning can still trigger on a machine that supports SMAPbut where it's disabled in the kernel config and when running thesyscall_nt selftest, for example:  ------------[ cut here ]------------  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 49 at irqentry_enter_from_user_mode  CPU: 0 PID: 49 Comm: init Tainted: G                T 5.15.0-rc4+ #98e6202628ee053b4f310759978284bd8bb0ce6905  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS1.10.2-1ubuntu1 04/01/2014  RIP: 0010:irqentry_enter_from_user_mode  ...
