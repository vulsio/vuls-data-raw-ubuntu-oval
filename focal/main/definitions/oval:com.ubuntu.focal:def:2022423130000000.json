		"Description": "Xenstore: guests can let run xenstored out of memory T[his CNA informationrecord relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains whichaspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Malicious guests cancause xenstored to allocate vast amounts of memory, eventually resulting ina Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored. There are multiple ways how guestscan cause large memory allocations in xenstored: - - by issuing newrequests to xenstored without reading the responses, causing the responsesto be buffered in memory - - by causing large number of watch events to begenerated via setting up multiple xenstore watches and then e.g. deletingmany xenstore nodes below the watched path - - by creating as many nodes asallowed with the maximum allowed size and path length in as manytransactions as possible - - by accessing many nodes inside a transaction",
