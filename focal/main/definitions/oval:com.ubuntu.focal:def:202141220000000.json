    "Description": "It was found that a specially crafted LUKS header could trick cryptsetup into disabling encryption during the recovery of the device.

The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncryptsetup - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.4\ncryptsetup-bin - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.4\ncryptsetup-initramfs - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.4\ncryptsetup-run - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.4\nlibcryptsetup12 - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.4\nNo subscription required",
