From the call trace, we can find threeinterrupts (noted A, B, C above): interrupt (A) is preempted by (B), whichis further interrupted by (C). Subsequent investigations show that (B)results in nmi_enter() being called, but that it actually is a spuriousinterrupt. Furthermore, interrupts are reenabled in the context of (B), and(C) fires with NMI priority. We end-up with a nested NMI situation,something we definitely do not want to (and cannot) handle. The bug here isthat spurious interrupts should never result in any state change, and weshould just return to the interrupted context. Moving the handling ofspurious interrupts as early as possible in the GICv3 handler fixes thisissue.
