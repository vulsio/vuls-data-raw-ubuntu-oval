		"title": "CVE-2022-33744 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of guestson Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep track of the foreign mappings.Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the related lockheld, resulting in a small race window, which can be used by unprivilegedguests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies of the rbtree. Theseinconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) of dom0, e.g. bycausing crashes or the inability to perform further mappings of otherguests' memory pages.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33744` to fix the vulnerability.
