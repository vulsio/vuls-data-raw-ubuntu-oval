		"Title": "CVE-2022-27672 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "When SMT is enabled, certain AMD processors may speculatively execute instructions using a target from the sibling thread after an SMT mode switch potentially resulting in information disclosure. It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-27672` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gke - 5.15.0-1033.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gkeop - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1091-raspi - 5.4.0-1091.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gke - 5.15.0-1033.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gkeop - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1027-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1027.31\nNo subscription required",
