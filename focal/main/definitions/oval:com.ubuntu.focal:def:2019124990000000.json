		"Title": "CVE-2019-12499 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "Firejail before 0.9.60 allows truncation (resizing to length 0) of the firejail binary on the host by running exploit code inside a firejail sandbox and having the sandbox terminated. To succeed, certain conditions need to be fulfilled: The jail (with the exploit code inside) needs to be started as root, and it also needs to be terminated as root from the host (either by stopping it ungracefully (e.g., SIGKILL), or by using the --shutdown control command). This is similar to CVE-2019-5736.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-12499` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirejail - 0.9.60-2\nfirejail-profiles - 0.9.60-2\nNo subscription required",
