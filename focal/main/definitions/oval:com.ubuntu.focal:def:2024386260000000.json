During the read, bit FR_SENT will be set on therequest.(2) calls fuse_dev_write() to send an USE_NOTIFY_RESEND notifyThe resend notify will resend all processing requests, so the INITrequest is moved from processing list to pending list again.(3) calls fuse_dev_read() with an invalid output addressfuse_dev_read() will try to copy the same INIT request to the outputaddress, but it will fail due to the invalid address, so the INITrequest is ended and triggers the warning in fuse_request_end().Fix it by clearing FR_SENT when re-adding requests into pending list.",
