		"description": "Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, parallel HTTP 1.1 server forRuby/Rack applications. When using Puma behind a proxy that does notproperly validate that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a requeststarts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-endproxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Usersare advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround: when deploying aproxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality to make surethat the request matches the RFC7230 standard.",
