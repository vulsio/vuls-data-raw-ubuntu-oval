		"description": "In Waitress through version 1.4.0, if a proxy server is used in front ofwaitress, an invalid request may be sent by an attacker that bypasses thefront-end and is parsed differently by waitress leading to a potential forHTTP request smuggling. Specially crafted requests containing specialwhitespace characters in the Transfer-Encoding header would get parsed byWaitress as being a chunked request, but a front-end server would use theContent-Length instead as the Transfer-Encoding header is consideredinvalid due to containing invalid characters. If a front-end server doesHTTP pipelining to a backend Waitress server this could lead to HTTPrequest splitting which may lead to potential cache poisoning or unexpectedinformation disclosure. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.1 through morestrict HTTP field validation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-16789` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-waitress - 1.4.1-1\nNo subscription required",
