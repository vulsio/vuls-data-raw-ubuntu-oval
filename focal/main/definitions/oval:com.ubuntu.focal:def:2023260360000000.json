		"description": "ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television softwareapplication for Linux which supports IP, USB and Analog cameras. Versionsprior to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33 contain a Local File Inclusion (UntrustedSearch Path) vulnerability via /web/index.php. By controlling $view, anylocal file ending in .php can be executed. This is supposed to be mitigatedby calling detaintPath, however dentaintPath does not properly sandbox thepath. This can be exploited by constructing paths like \"..././\", which getreplaced by \"../\". This issue is patched in versions 1.36.33 and 1.37.33.",
