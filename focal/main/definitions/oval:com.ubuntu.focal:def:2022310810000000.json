		"Title": "CVE-2022-31081 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions priorto 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploitedto gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It isuncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are servedon top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library iscommonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to updateto resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional requesthandling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst =$conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request`object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl =$rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that shouldbe dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length'SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a commaseparated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`).Anything else MUST be rejected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-31081` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibhttp-daemon-perl - 6.06-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
