		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:workqueue: Fix spruious data race in __flush_work()When flushing a work item for cancellation, __flush_work() knows that itexclusively owns the work item through its PENDING bit. 134874e2eee9(\"workqueue: Allow cancel_work_sync() and disable_work() from atomiccontexts on BH work items\") added a read of @work->data to determinewhetherto use busy wait for BH work items that are being canceled. While the readis safe when @from_cancel, @work->data was read before testing @from_cancelto simplify code structure:\tdata = *work_data_bits(work);\tif (from_cancel &&\t    !WARN_ON_ONCE(data & WORK_STRUCT_PWQ) && (data & WORK_OFFQ_BH)) {While the read data was never used if !@from_cancel, this could triggerKCSAN data race detection spuriously:  ==================================================================  BUG: KCSAN: data-race in __flush_work / __flush_work  write to 0xffff8881223aa3e8 of 8 bytes by task 3998 on cpu 0:   instrument_write include/linux/instrumented.h:41 [inline]   ___set_bit include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-non-atomic.h:28[inline]   insert_wq_barrier kernel/workqueue.c:3790 [inline]   start_flush_work kernel/workqueue.c:4142 [inline]   __flush_work+0x30b/0x570 kernel/workqueue.c:4178   flush_work kernel/workqueue.c:4229 [inline]   ...  read to 0xffff8881223aa3e8 of 8 bytes by task 50 on cpu 1:   __flush_work+0x42a/0x570 kernel/workqueue.c:4188   flush_work kernel/workqueue.c:4229 [inline]   flush_delayed_work+0x66/0x70 kernel/workqueue.c:4251   ...  value changed: 0x0000000000400000 -> 0xffff88810006c00dReorganize the code so that @from_cancel is tested before @work->data isaccessed.
