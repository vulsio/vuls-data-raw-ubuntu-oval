		"Title": "CVE-2022-45887 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/usb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c has a memory leak because of the lack of a dvb_frontend_detach call. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45887` to fix the vulnerability.
