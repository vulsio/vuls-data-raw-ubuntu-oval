		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Fix command stats access after freeCommand may fail while driver is reloading and can't accept FW commandstill command interface is reinitialized. Such command failure is beinglogged to command stats. This results in NULL pointer access as commandstats structure is being freed and reallocated during mlx5 devlinkreload (see kernel log below).Fix it by making command stats statically allocated on driver probe.Kernel log:[ 2394.808802] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at000000000002a9c0[ 2394.810610] PGD 0 P4D 0[ 2394.811811] Oops: 0002 [#1] SMP NOPTI...[ 2394.815482] RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x183/0x1d0...[ 2394.829505] Call Trace:[ 2394.830667]  _raw_spin_lock_irq+0x23/0x26[ 2394.831858]  cmd_status_err+0x55/0x110 [mlx5_core][ 2394.833020]  mlx5_access_reg+0xe7/0x150 [mlx5_core][ 2394.834175]  mlx5_query_port_ptys+0x78/0xa0 [mlx5_core][ 2394.835337]  mlx5e_ethtool_get_link_ksettings+0x74/0x590 [mlx5_core][ 2394.836454]  ? kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x140/0x1c0[ 2394.837562]  __rh_call_get_link_ksettings+0x33/0x100[ 2394.838663]  ? __rtnl_unlock+0x25/0x50[ 2394.839755]  __ethtool_get_link_ksettings+0x72/0x150[ 2394.840862]  duplex_show+0x6e/0xc0[ 2394.841963]  dev_attr_show+0x1c/0x40[ 2394.843048]  sysfs_kf_seq_show+0x9b/0x100[ 2394.844123]  seq_read+0x153/0x410[ 2394.845187]  vfs_read+0x91/0x140[ 2394.846226]  ksys_read+0x4f/0xb0[ 2394.847234]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x1a0[ 2394.848228]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x65/0xca\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48884` to fix the vulnerability.
