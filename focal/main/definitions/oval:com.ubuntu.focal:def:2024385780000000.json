		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ecryptfs: Fix buffer size for tag 66 packetThe 'TAG 66 Packet Format' description is missing the cipher code andchecksum fields that are packed into the message packet. As a result,the buffer allocated for the packet is 3 bytes too small andwrite_tag_66_packet() will write up to 3 bytes past the end of thebuffer.Fix this by increasing the size of the allocation so the whole packetwill always fit in the buffer.This fixes the below kasan slab-out-of-bounds bug:  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds inecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set+0x7d6/0xde0  Write of size 1 at addr ffff88800afbb2a5 by task touch/181  CPU: 0 PID: 181 Comm: touch Not tainted 6.6.13-gnu #14c9534092be820851bb687b82d1f92a426598dc6  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.2/GNUGuix 04/01/2014  Call Trace:   <TASK>   dump_stack_lvl+0x4c/0x70   print_report+0xc5/0x610   ? ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set+0x7d6/0xde0   ? kasan_complete_mode_report_info+0x44/0x210   ? ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set+0x7d6/0xde0   kasan_report+0xc2/0x110   ? ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set+0x7d6/0xde0   __asan_store1+0x62/0x80   ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set+0x7d6/0xde0   ? __pfx_ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set+0x10/0x10   ? __alloc_pages+0x2e2/0x540   ? __pfx_ovl_open+0x10/0x10 [overlay30837f11141636a8e1793533a02e6e2e885dad1d]   ? dentry_open+0x8f/0xd0   ecryptfs_write_metadata+0x30a/0x550   ? __pfx_ecryptfs_write_metadata+0x10/0x10   ? ecryptfs_get_lower_file+0x6b/0x190   ecryptfs_initialize_file+0x77/0x150   ecryptfs_create+0x1c2/0x2f0   path_openat+0x17cf/0x1ba0   ? __pfx_path_openat+0x10/0x10   do_filp_open+0x15e/0x290   ? __pfx_do_filp_open+0x10/0x10   ? __kasan_check_write+0x18/0x30   ? _raw_spin_lock+0x86/0xf0   ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock+0x10/0x10   ? __kasan_check_write+0x18/0x30   ? alloc_fd+0xf4/0x330   do_sys_openat2+0x122/0x160   ? __pfx_do_sys_openat2+0x10/0x10   __x64_sys_openat+0xef/0x170   ? __pfx___x64_sys_openat+0x10/0x10   do_syscall_64+0x60/0xd0   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0xd8  RIP: 0033:0x7f00a703fd67  Code: 25 00 00 41 00 3d 00 00 41 00 74 37 64 8b 04 25 18 00 00 00 85 c075 5b 44 89 e2 48 89 ee bf 9c ff ff ff b8 01 01 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0ff ff 0f 87 85 00 00 00 48 83 c4 68 5d 41 5c c3 0f 1f  RSP: 002b:00007ffc088e30b0 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000101  RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffc088e3368 RCX: 00007f00a703fd67  RDX: 0000000000000941 RSI: 00007ffc088e48d7 RDI: 00000000ffffff9c  RBP: 00007ffc088e48d7 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000  R10: 00000000000001b6 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000941  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00007ffc088e48d7 R15: 00007f00a7180040   </TASK>  Allocated by task 181:   kasan_save_stack+0x2f/0x60   kasan_set_track+0x29/0x40   kasan_save_alloc_info+0x25/0x40   __kasan_kmalloc+0xc5/0xd0   __kmalloc+0x66/0x160   ecryptfs_generate_key_packet_set+0x6d2/0xde0   ecryptfs_write_metadata+0x30a/0x550   ecryptfs_initialize_file+0x77/0x150   ecryptfs_create+0x1c2/0x2f0   path_openat+0x17cf/0x1ba0   do_filp_open+0x15e/0x290   do_sys_openat2+0x122/0x160   __x64_sys_openat+0xef/0x170   do_syscall_64+0x60/0xd0   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0xd8",
