		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfs:fix UAF in direct writes In production we have been hitting the followingwarning consistently ------------[ cut here ]------------ refcount_t:underflow; use-after-free. WARNING: CPU: 17 PID: 1800359 atlib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0 Workqueue: nfsiodnfs_direct_write_schedule_work [nfs] RIP:0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0 PKRU: 55555554 Call Trace: <TASK> ?__warn+0x9f/0x130 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0 ?report_bug+0xcc/0x150 ? handle_bug+0x3d/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x40 ?asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0xe0nfs_direct_write_schedule_work+0x237/0x250 [nfs]process_one_work+0x12f/0x4a0 worker_thread+0x14e/0x3b0 ?ZSTD_getCParams_internal+0x220/0x220 kthread+0xdc/0x120 ?__btf_name_valid+0xa0/0xa0 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 This is because we'recompleting the nfs_direct_request twice in a row. The source of this iswhen we have our commit requests to submit, we process them and send themoff, and then in the completion path for the commit requests we have if(nfs_commit_end(cinfo.mds)) nfs_direct_write_complete(dreq); However sincewe're submitting asynchronous requests we sometimes have one that completesbefore we submit the next one, so we end up calling complete on thenfs_direct_request twice. The only other place we usenfs_generic_commit_list() is in __nfs_commit_inode, which wraps this callin a nfs_commit_begin(); nfs_commit_end(); Which is a common pattern forthis style of completion handling, one that is also repeated in the directcode with get_dreq()/put_dreq() calls around where we process events aswell as in the completion paths. Fix this by using the same pattern for thecommit requests. Before with my 200 node rocksdb stress running thiswarning would pop every 10ish minutes. With my patch the stress test hasbeen running for several hours without popping.",
