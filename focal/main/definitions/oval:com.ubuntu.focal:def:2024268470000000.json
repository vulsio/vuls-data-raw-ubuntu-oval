		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/rtas: use correct function name for resetting TCE tablesThe PAPR spec spells the function name as  \"ibm,reset-pe-dma-windows\"but in practice firmware uses the singular form:  \"ibm,reset-pe-dma-window\"in the device tree.
