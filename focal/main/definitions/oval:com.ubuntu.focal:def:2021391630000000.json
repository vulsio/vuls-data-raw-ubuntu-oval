		"description": "Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice overIP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name,avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of theroom. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerablehomeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to creategroups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can creategroups. However, homeserver administrators can already access thisinformation in the database or using the admin API. As a result, onlyhomeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` hasbeen set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potentialworkarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to`false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) toprevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that areusing a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality,block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and`/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.",
