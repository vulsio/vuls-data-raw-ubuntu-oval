		"title": "CVE-2023-1078 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets)protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of alist causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this withrds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info*info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled bylocal user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of boundsaccess, and a lock corruption.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1078` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-149.166\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-kvm - 5.4.0-1091.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-aws - 5.4.0-1102.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-azure - 5.4.0-1108.114\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-bluefield - 5.4.0-1064.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gcp - 5.4.0-1105.114\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-gke - 5.4.0-1099.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gke - 5.15.0-1033.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-gkeop - 5.4.0-1069.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-ibm - 5.4.0-1049.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1085-raspi - 5.4.0-1085.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1024.28\nNo subscription required",
