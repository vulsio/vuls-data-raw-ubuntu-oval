		"Title": "CVE-2021-46822 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "The PPM reader in libjpeg-turbo through 2.0.90 mishandles use of tjLoadImage for loading a 16-bit binary PPM file into a grayscale buffer and loading a 16-bit binary PGM file into an RGB buffer. This is related to a heap-based buffer overflow in the get_word_rgb_row function in rdppm.c.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46822` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjpeg-turbo-progs - 2.0.3-0ubuntu1.20.04.3\nlibjpeg-turbo-test - 2.0.3-0ubuntu1.20.04.3\nlibjpeg-turbo8 - 2.0.3-0ubuntu1.20.04.3\nlibturbojpeg - 2.0.3-0ubuntu1.20.04.3\nNo subscription required",

		"Note": "mdeslaur> per the upstream fix, no known applications attempt to load a 16-bit PPM file into a grayscale uncompressed image buffer, which is the vulnerability described in this CVE. As such, downgrading priority to low as this vulnerability isn't exposed. ccdm94> As per the description in commit f35fd27ec64, this only affects versions of libjpeg-turbo which have the tjLoadImage function implemented. This function was introduced by commit aa7459050. The code related to this commit is not present in bionic and earlier, meaning that these releases are not vulnerable (this affects libjpeg-turbo > 1.5.3)."
