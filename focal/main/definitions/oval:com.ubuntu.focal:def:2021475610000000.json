		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c:virtio: disable timeout handling If a timeout is hit, it can result isincorrect data on the I2C bus and/or memory corruptions in the guest sincethe device can still be operating on the buffers it was given while theguest has freed them. Here is, for example, the start of a slub_debug splatwhich was triggered on the next transfer after one transfer was forced totimeout by setting a breakpoint in the backend (rust-vmm/vhost-device): BUGkmalloc-1k (Not tainted): Poison overwritten First byte 0x1 instead of 0x6bAllocated in virtio_i2c_xfer+0x65/0x35c age=350 cpu=0 pid=29__kmalloc+0xc2/0x1c9 virtio_i2c_xfer+0x65/0x35c __i2c_transfer+0x429/0x57di2c_transfer+0x115/0x134 i2cdev_ioctl_rdwr+0x16a/0x1dei2cdev_ioctl+0x247/0x2ed vfs_ioctl+0x21/0x30 sys_ioctl+0xb18/0xb41 Freed invirtio_i2c_xfer+0x32e/0x35c age=244 cpu=0 pid=29 kfree+0x1bd/0x1ccvirtio_i2c_xfer+0x32e/0x35c __i2c_transfer+0x429/0x57di2c_transfer+0x115/0x134 i2cdev_ioctl_rdwr+0x16a/0x1dei2cdev_ioctl+0x247/0x2ed vfs_ioctl+0x21/0x30 sys_ioctl+0xb18/0xb41 There isno simple fix for this (the driver would have to always create bouncebuffers and hold on to them until the device eventually returns thebuffers), so just disable the timeout support for now.",
