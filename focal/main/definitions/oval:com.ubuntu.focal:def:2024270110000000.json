		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort pathThe delete set command does not rely on the transaction object forelement removal, therefore, a combination of delete element + delete setfrom the abort path could result in restoring twice the refcount of themapping.Check for inactive element in the next generation for the delete elementcommand in the abort path, skip restoring state if next generation bithas been already cleared.
