This can be abused to steal session cookies, perform requests in the name of the victim or for phishing attacks.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-13959` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibvelocity-tools-java - 2.0-7ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
