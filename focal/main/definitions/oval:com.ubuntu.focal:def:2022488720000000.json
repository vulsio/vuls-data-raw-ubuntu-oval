Propagate this to callers so they can know if a map isabout to be deleted.Fixes this warning:refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 10100 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate...Call trace: refcount_warn_saturate [fastrpc_map_get inlined] [fastrpc_map_lookup inlined] fastrpc_map_create fastrpc_internal_invoke fastrpc_device_ioctl __arm64_sys_ioctl invoke_syscall\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48872` to fix the vulnerability.
