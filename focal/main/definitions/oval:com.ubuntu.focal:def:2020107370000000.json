		"Title": "CVE-2020-10737 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "A race condition was found in the mkhomedir tool shipped with the oddjobpackage in versions before 0.34.5 and 0.34.6 wherein, during the homecreation, mkhomedir copies the /etc/skel directory into the newly createdhome and changes its ownership to the home's user without properly checkingthe homedir path. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue bycreating a symlink point to a target folder, which then has its ownershiptransferred to the new home directory's unprivileged user.",
