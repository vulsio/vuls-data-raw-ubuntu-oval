		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: fix memory corruption bug with suspend and rebuildThe ice driver would previously panic after suspend. This is causedfrom the driver *only* calling the ice_vsi_free_q_vectors() function byitself, when it is suspending. Since commit b3e7b3a6ee92 (\"ice: preventNULL pointer deref during reload\") the driver has zeroed outnum_q_vectors, and only restored it in ice_vsi_cfg_def().This further causes the ice_rebuild() function to allocate a zero lengthbuffer, after which num_q_vectors is updated, and then the new value ofnum_q_vectors is used to index into the zero length buffer, whichcorrupts memory.The fix entails making sure all the code referencing num_q_vectors onlydoes so after it has been reset via ice_vsi_cfg_def().I didn't perform a full bisect, but I was able to test against 6.1.77kernel and that ice driver works fine for suspend/resume with no panic,so sometime since then, this problem was introduced.Also clean up an un-needed init of a local variable in the functionbeing modified.PANIC from 6.8.0-rc1:[1026674.915596] PM: suspend exit[1026675.664697] ice 0000:17:00.1: PTP reset successful[1026675.664707] ice 0000:17:00.1: 2755 msecs passed between update tocached PHC time[1026675.667660] ice 0000:b1:00.0: PTP reset successful[1026675.675944] ice 0000:b1:00.0: 2832 msecs passed between update tocached PHC time[1026677.137733] ixgbe 0000:31:00.0 ens787: NIC Link is Up 1 Gbps, FlowControl: None[1026677.190201] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:0000000000000010[1026677.192753] ice 0000:17:00.0: PTP reset successful[1026677.192764] ice 0000:17:00.0: 4548 msecs passed between update tocached PHC time[1026677.197928] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode[1026677.197933] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page[1026677.197937] PGD 1557a7067 P4D 0[1026677.212133] ice 0000:b1:00.1: PTP reset successful[1026677.212143] ice 0000:b1:00.1: 4344 msecs passed between update tocached PHC time[1026677.212575][1026677.243142] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI[1026677.247918] CPU: 23 PID: 42790 Comm: kworker/23:0 Kdump: loadedTainted: G        W          6.8.0-rc1+ #1[1026677.257989] Hardware name: Intel CorporationM50CYP2SBSTD/M50CYP2SBSTD, BIOS SE5C620.86B.01.01.0005.220216081002/16/2022[1026677.269367] Workqueue: ice ice_service_task [ice][1026677.274592] RIP: 0010:ice_vsi_rebuild_set_coalesce+0x130/0x1e0 [ice][1026677.281421] Code: 0f 84 3a ff ff ff 41 0f b7 74 ec 02 66 89 b0 22 0200 00 81 e6 ff 1f 00 00 e8 ec fd ff ff e9 35 ff ff ff 48 8b 43 30 49 63 ed<41> 0f b7 34 24 41 83 c5 01 48 8b 3c e8 66 89 b7 aa 02 00 00 81 e6[1026677.300877] RSP: 0018:ff3be62a6399bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010202[1026677.306556] RAX: ff28691e28980828 RBX: ff28691e41099828 RCX:0000000000188000[1026677.314148] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000010 RDI:ff28691e41099828[1026677.321730] RBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09:0000000000000000[1026677.329311] R10: 0000000000000007 R11: ffffffffffffffc0 R12:0000000000000010[1026677.336896] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15:ff28691e0eaa81a0[1026677.344472] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ff28693cbffc0000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000[1026677.353000] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[1026677.359195] CR2: 0000000000000010 CR3: 0000000128df4001 CR4:0000000000771ef0[1026677.366779] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2:0000000000000000[1026677.374369] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7:0000000000000400[1026677.381952] PKRU: 55555554[1026677.385116] Call Trace:[1026677.388023]  <TASK>[1026677.390589]  ? __die+0x20/0x70[1026677.394105]  ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160[1026677.398576]  ? do_user_addr_fault+0x65/0x6a0[1026677.403307]  ? exc_page_fault+0x6a/0x150[1026677.407694]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30[1026677.412349]  ? ice_vsi_rebuild_set_coalesce+0x130/0x1e0 [ice][1026677.4186---truncated---",
