		"description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault managementframework. There are two instances of insecure deserialization in Cactiversion 1.2.24. While a viable gadget chain exists in Cacti’s vendordirectory (phpseclib), the necessary gadgets are not included, making theminaccessible and the insecure deserializations not exploitable. Eachinstance of insecure deserialization is due to using the unserializefunction without sanitizing the user input. Cacti has a “safe”deserialization that attempts to sanitize the content and check forspecific values before calling unserialize, but it isn’t used in theseinstances. The vulnerable code lies in graphs_new.php, specifically withinthe host_new_graphs_save function. This issue has been addressed in version1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds forthis vulnerability.",
