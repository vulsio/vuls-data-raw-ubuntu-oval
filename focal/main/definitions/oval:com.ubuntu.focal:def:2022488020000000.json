MADV_FREE may split THPs if it is calledfor partial THP.  It may trigger the below race:           CPU A                         CPU B           -----                         -----  smaps walk:                      MADV_FREE:  page_mapcount()    PageCompound()                                   split_huge_page()    page = compound_head(page)    PageDoubleMap(page)When calling PageDoubleMap() this page is not a tail page of THP anymoreso the BUG is triggered.This could be fixed by elevated refcount of the page before callingmapcount, but that would prevent it from counting migration entries, andit seems overkilling because the race just could happen when PMD issplit so all PTE entries of tail pages are actually migration entries,and smaps_account() does treat migration entries as mapcount == 1 asKirill pointed out.Add a new parameter for smaps_account() to tell this entry is migrationentry then skip calling page_mapcount().  Don't skip getting mapcountfor device private entries since they do track references with mapcount.Pagemap also has the similar issue although it was not reported.
