So to avoid this problem, add an additional referencecount to cachefiles_req, which is held while waiting and reading, and thenreleased when the waiting and reading is over.Note that since there is only one reference count for waiting, we need toavoid the same request being completed multiple times, so we can onlycomplete the request if it is successfully removed from the xarray.",
