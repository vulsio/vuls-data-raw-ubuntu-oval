		"description": "Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component ofDocker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container toolingor runtimes. In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces,including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An containerwith an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured toshare an external network link with the host machine. Because of thisdirect access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hostson the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if routeradvertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers mayget SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface  will be a member ofIPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks presentan unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue ispatched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use`--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or`docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file.",
