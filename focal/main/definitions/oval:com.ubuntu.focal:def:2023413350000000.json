		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by theMatrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords, the newcredentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn'tgrant the server any added capabilities—it already learns the users'passwords as part of the authentication process—it does disrupt theexpectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result,these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups for alonger duration. These temporarily stored passwords are automaticallyerased after a 48-hour window. This issue has been addressed in version1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds forthis issue.",
