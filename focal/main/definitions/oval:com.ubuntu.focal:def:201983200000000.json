		"Title": "CVE-2019-8320 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.7.6 and laterthrough 3.0.2. Before making new directories or touching files (which nowinclude path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the targetdestination. If that destination was hidden behind a symlink, a maliciousgem could delete arbitrary files on the user's machine, presuming theattacker could guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, andhow predictable paths are on modern systems (/tmp, /usr, etc.), this couldlikely lead to data loss or an unusable system.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-8320` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njruby - 9.1.17.0-3\nNo subscription required",
