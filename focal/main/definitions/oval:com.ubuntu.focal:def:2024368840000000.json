		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/arm-smmu: Use the correct type in nvidia_smmu_context_fault()This was missed because of the function pointer indirection.nvidia_smmu_context_fault() is also installed as a irq function, and the'void *' was changed to a struct arm_smmu_domain. Since the iommu_domainis embedded at a non-zero offset this causes nvidia_smmu_context_fault()to miscompute the offset. Fixup the types.
