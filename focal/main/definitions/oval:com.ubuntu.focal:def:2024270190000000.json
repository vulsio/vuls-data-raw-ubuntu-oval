		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: Fix potential data-race in __nft_obj_type_get()nft_unregister_obj() can concurrent with __nft_obj_type_get(), and there isnot any protection when iterate over nf_tables_objects list in__nft_obj_type_get(). Therefore, there is potential data-race ofnf_tables_objects list entry. Use list_for_each_entry_rcu() to iterate overnf_tables_objects list in __nft_obj_type_get(), and use rcu_read_lock() inthe caller nft_obj_type_get() to protect the entire type query process.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27019` to fix the vulnerability.
