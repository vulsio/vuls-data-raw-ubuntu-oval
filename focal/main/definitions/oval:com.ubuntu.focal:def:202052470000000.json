		"description": "In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.2 and before 3.12.3, if an application usingPuma allows untrusted input in a response header, an attacker can usenewline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF` or`/r`, `/n`) to end the header andinject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely newresponse body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting.While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for severalother attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related toCVE-2019-16254, which fixed this vulnerability for the WEBrick Ruby webserver. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking allheaders for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-5247` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npuma - 3.12.4-1ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
