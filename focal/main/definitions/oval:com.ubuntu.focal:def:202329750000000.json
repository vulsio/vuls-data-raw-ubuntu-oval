		"description": "Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causesit to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as aconsequence. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithmand want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can bemislead by removing adding or reordering such empty entries as these areignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently unaware of any suchapplications. The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multipleassociated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate emptydata the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (orEVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as theinput buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returnssuccess for such a call instead of performing the associated dataauthentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. Asthis issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and weexpect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated dataentries this is qualified as Low severity issue.",
