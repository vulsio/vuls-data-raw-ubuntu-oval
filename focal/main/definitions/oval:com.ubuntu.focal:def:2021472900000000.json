		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:target: Fix NULL dereference on XCOPY completion CPU affinity control addedwith commit 39ae3edda325 (\"scsi: target: core: Make completion affinityconfigurable\") makes target_complete_cmd() queue work on a CPU based onse_tpg->se_tpg_wwn->cmd_compl_affinity state. LIO's EXTENDED COPY worker isa special case in that read/write cmds are dispatched using the globalxcopy_pt_tpg, which carries a NULL se_tpg_wwn pointer followinginitialization in target_xcopy_setup_pt(). The NULLxcopy_pt_tpg->se_tpg_wwn pointer is dereferenced on completion of anyEXTENDED COPY initiated read/write cmds. E.g using the libiscsiSCSI.ExtendedCopy.Simple test: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference,address: 00000000000001a8 RIP: 0010:target_complete_cmd+0x9d/0x130[target_core_mod] Call Trace: fd_execute_rw+0x148/0x42a [target_core_file]? __dynamic_pr_debug+0xa7/0xe0 ? target_check_reservation+0x5b/0x940[target_core_mod] __target_execute_cmd+0x1e/0x90 [target_core_mod]transport_generic_new_cmd+0x17c/0x330 [target_core_mod]target_xcopy_issue_pt_cmd+0x9/0x60 [target_core_mod]target_xcopy_read_source.isra.7+0x10b/0x1b0 [target_core_mod] ?target_check_fua+0x40/0x40 [target_core_mod] ?transport_complete_task_attr+0x130/0x130 [target_core_mod]target_xcopy_do_work+0x61f/0xc00 [target_core_mod] This fix makestarget_complete_cmd() queue work on se_cmd->cpuid if se_tpg_wwn is NULL.",
