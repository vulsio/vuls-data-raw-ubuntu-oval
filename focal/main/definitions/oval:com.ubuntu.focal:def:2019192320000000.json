		"description": "** DISPUTED ** In Sudo through 1.8.29, an attacker with access to a RunasALL sudoer account can impersonate a nonexistent user by invoking sudo witha numeric uid that is not associated with any user. NOTE: The softwaremaintainer believes that this is not a vulnerability because running acommand via sudo as a user not present in the local password database is anintentional feature. Because this behavior surprised some users, sudo1.8.30 introduced an option to enable/disable this behavior with thedefault being disabled. However, this does not change the fact that sudowas behaving as intended, and as documented, in earlier versions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19232` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsudo - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1\nsudo-ldap - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
