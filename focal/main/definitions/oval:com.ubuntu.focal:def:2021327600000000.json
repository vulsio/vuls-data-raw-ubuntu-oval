		"description": "containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd versionsprior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-craftedcontainer image can result in Unix file permission changes for existingfiles in the hostâ€™s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny accessto the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or set extendedbits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly allowfiles to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperatingprocess. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As aworkaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources. Linuxsecurity modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the filespotentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that preventcontainerd from interacting with specific files.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32760` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncontainerd - 1.5.2-0ubuntu1~20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
