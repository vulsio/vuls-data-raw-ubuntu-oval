		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: isdn:mISDN: netjet: Fix crash in nj_probe: 'nj_setup' in netjet.c might failwith -EIO and in this case 'card->irq' is initialized and is bigger thanzero. A subsequent call to 'nj_release' will free the irq that has not beenrequested. Fix this bug by deleting the previous assignment to 'card->irq'and just keep the assignment before 'request_irq'.
