		"description": "Cargo downloads the Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles the project.Cargo prior to version 0.72.2, bundled with Rust prior to version 1.71.1,did not respect the umask when extracting crate archives on UNIX-likesystems. If the user downloaded a crate containing files writeable by anylocal user, another local user could exploit this to change the source codecompiled and executed by the current user. To prevent existing cachedextractions from being exploitable, the Cargo binary version 0.72.2included in Rust 1.71.1 or later will purge caches generated by older Cargoversions automatically. As a workaround, configure one's system to preventother local users from accessing the Cargo directory, usually located in`~/.cargo`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38497` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncargo - 0.67.1+ds0ubuntu0.libgit2-0ubuntu0.20.04.2+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
