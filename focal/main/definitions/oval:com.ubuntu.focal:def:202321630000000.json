    "Title": "CVE-2023-2163 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "Incorrect verifier pruning in BPF in Linux Kernel >=5.4 leads to unsafe code paths being incorrectly marked as safe, resulting in arbitrary read/write in kernel memory, lateral privilege escalation, and container escape. Juan Jose Lopez Jaimez, Meador Inge, Simon Scannell, and Nenad Stojanovski discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly mark registers for precision tracking in certain situations, leading to an out- of-bounds access vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2163` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-aws - 5.15.0-1041.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1043.50~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gkeop - 5.4.0-1076.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-kvm - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1093-raspi - 5.4.0-1093.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-aws - 5.15.0-1041.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1043.50~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gkeop - 5.4.0-1076.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-kvm - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1029-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1029.33\nNo subscription required",
