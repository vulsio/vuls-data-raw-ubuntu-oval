This results in a panic when the send completion runs. Theexact panic varies depending on what elements of the container structureget corrupted. The fix is to use the correct expression in_pad_sdma_tx_descs() to test the need to expand the descriptor array.With this patch the crashes are no longer reproducible and the machine isstable.",
