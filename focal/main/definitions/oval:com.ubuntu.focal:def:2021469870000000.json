		"title": "CVE-2021-46987 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroupsThere are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs tocopy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.When this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a dirtypage for the destination inode and while having the range locked in thedestination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata spacefor a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there isnot enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,which was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d (\"btrfs: fix deadlock whencloning inline extent and low on free metadata space\").However when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroupspace, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is notenough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, sinceflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotreeand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the cloneoperation, before attempting to start the transaction.When this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:  2 flags:0x00004000  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)  [72747.556271] Call Trace:  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]  [72747.566961] Call Trace:  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:---truncated---",
