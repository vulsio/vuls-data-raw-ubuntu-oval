		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/64s: fix program check interrupt emergency stack pathEmergency stack path was jumping into a 3: label inside the__GEN_COMMON_BODY macro for the normal path after it had finished,rather than jumping over it. By a small miracle this is the correctplace to build up a new interrupt frame with the existing stackpointer, so things basically worked okay with an added weird looking700 trap frame on top (which had the wrong ->nip so it didn't decodebug messages either).Fix this by avoiding using numeric labels when jumping over non-trivialmacros.Before: LE PAGE_SIZE=64K MMU=Radix SMP NR_CPUS=2048 NUMA PowerNV Modules linked in: CPU: 0 PID: 88 Comm: sh Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2-00034-ge057cdade6e5 #2637 NIP:  7265677368657265 LR: c00000000006c0c8 CTR: c0000000000097f0 REGS: c0000000fffb3a50 TRAP: 0700   Not tainted MSR:  9000000000021031 <SF,HV,ME,IR,DR,LE>  CR: 00000700  XER: 20040000 CFAR: c0000000000098b0 IRQMASK: 0 GPR00: c00000000006c964 c0000000fffb3cf0 c000000001513800 0000000000000000 GPR04: 0000000048ab0778 0000000042000000 0000000000000000 0000000000001299 GPR08: 000001e447c718ec 0000000022424282 0000000000002710 c00000000006bee8 GPR12: 9000000000009033 c0000000016b0000 00000000000000b0 0000000000000001 GPR16: 0000000000000000 0000000000000002 0000000000000000 0000000000000ff8 GPR20: 0000000000001fff 0000000000000007 0000000000000080 00007fff89d90158 GPR24: 0000000002000000 0000000002000000 0000000000000255 0000000000000300 GPR28: c000000001270000 0000000042000000 0000000048ab0778 c000000080647e80 NIP [7265677368657265] 0x7265677368657265 LR [c00000000006c0c8] ___do_page_fault+0x3f8/0xb10 Call Trace: [c0000000fffb3cf0] [c00000000000bdac] soft_nmi_common+0x13c/0x1d0(unreliable) --- interrupt: 700 at decrementer_common_virt+0xb8/0x230 NIP:  c0000000000098b8 LR: c00000000006c0c8 CTR: c0000000000097f0 REGS: c0000000fffb3d60 TRAP: 0700   Not tainted MSR:  9000000000021031 <SF,HV,ME,IR,DR,LE>  CR: 22424282  XER: 20040000 CFAR: c0000000000098b0 IRQMASK: 0 GPR00: c00000000006c964 0000000000002400 c000000001513800 0000000000000000 GPR04: 0000000048ab0778 0000000042000000 0000000000000000 0000000000001299 GPR08: 000001e447c718ec 0000000022424282 0000000000002710 c00000000006bee8 GPR12: 9000000000009033 c0000000016b0000 00000000000000b0 0000000000000001 GPR16: 0000000000000000 0000000000000002 0000000000000000 0000000000000ff8 GPR20: 0000000000001fff 0000000000000007 0000000000000080 00007fff89d90158 GPR24: 0000000002000000 0000000002000000 0000000000000255 0000000000000300 GPR28: c000000001270000 0000000042000000 0000000048ab0778 c000000080647e80 NIP [c0000000000098b8] decrementer_common_virt+0xb8/0x230 LR [c00000000006c0c8] ___do_page_fault+0x3f8/0xb10 --- interrupt: 700 Instruction dump: XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX ---[ end trace 6d28218e0cc3c949 ]---After: ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:491!
