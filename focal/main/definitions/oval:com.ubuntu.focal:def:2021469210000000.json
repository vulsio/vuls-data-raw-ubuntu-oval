		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader canacquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loopschecking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only trulyacquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completedsuccessfully which isnâ€™t ordered. This exposes the window between theacquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows readsfollowing the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively beforethe write lock is truly acquired.We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg whileholding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out fromunder it.
