		"description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Variable names presentare expanded in the supplied command line into their corresponding variablecontents, using a 1kB stack buffer for temporary storage, withoutsufficient bounds checking. If the function is called with a command linethat references a variable with a sufficiently large payload, it ispossible to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame and controlexecution which could also circumvent Secure Boot protections. The highestthreat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity aswell as system availability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-27749` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.167.2+2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.167.2+2.04-1ubuntu44.2\nNo subscription required",
