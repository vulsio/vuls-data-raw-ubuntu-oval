And the original endio function called bio_put() to free the wholebio.This means a double freeing thus causing use-after-free, e.g.:1. Enter btrfs_submit_bio() with a read bio   The read bio length is 128K, crossing two 64K stripes.2. The first run of btrfs_submit_chunk()2.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which returns 64K2.2 Call btrfs_split_bio()    Now there are two bios, one referring to the first 64K, the other    referring to the second 64K.2.3 The first half is submitted.3. The second run of btrfs_submit_chunk()3.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which by somehow failed    Now we call btrfs_bio_end_io() to handle the error3.2 btrfs_bio_end_io() calls the original endio function    Which is end_bbio_data_read(), and it calls bio_put() for the    original bio.    Now the original bio is freed.4. The submitted first 64K bio finished   Now we call into btrfs_check_read_bio() and tries to advance the bio   iter.   But since the original bio (thus its iter) is already freed, we   trigger the above use-after free.   And even if the memory is not poisoned/corrupted, we will later call   the original endio function, causing a double freeing.[FIX]Instead of calling btrfs_bio_end_io(), call btrfs_orig_bbio_end_io(),which has the extra check on split bios and do the pr---truncated---",
