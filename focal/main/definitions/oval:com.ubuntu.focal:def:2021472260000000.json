		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user bufferBoth Intel and AMD consider it to be architecturally valid for XRSTOR tofail with #PF but nonetheless change the register state.  The actualconditions under which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seemsplausible that this might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a pageand invalidates the shared TLB while another sibling thread is executingXRSTOR on the page in question.__fpu__restore_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardware registersare preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using thefpu_fpregs_owner_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail butmodify the registers.If this happens, then there is a window in which __fpu__restore_sig()could schedule out and the victim task could schedule back in withoutreloading its own FPU registers. This would result in part of the FPUstate that __fpu__restore_sig() was attempting to load leaking into thevictim task's user-visible state.Invalidate preserved FPU registers on XRSTOR failure to prevent thissituation from corrupting any state.[1] Frequent readers of the errata lists might imagine \"complex    microarchitectural conditions\".",
