		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: virtio:delete vq in vp_find_vqs_msix() when request_irq() fails When request_irq()fails, error path calls vp_del_vqs(). There, as vq is present in the list,free_irq() is called for the same vector. That causes following splat: [0.414355] Trying to free already-free IRQ 27 [ 0.414403] WARNING: CPU: 1PID: 1 at kernel/irq/manage.c:1899 free_irq+0x1a1/0x2d0 [ 0.414510] Moduleslinked in: [ 0.414540] CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc4+#27 [ 0.414540] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS1.16.3-1.fc39 04/01/2014 [ 0.414540] RIP: 0010:free_irq+0x1a1/0x2d0 [0.414540] Code: 1e 00 48 83 c4 08 48 89 e8 5b 5d 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41 5f c3cc cc cc cc 90 8b 74 24 04 48 c7 c7 98 80 6c b1 e8 00 c9 f7 ff 90 <0f> 0b90 90 48 89 ee 4c 89 ef e8 e0 20 b8 00 49 8b 47 40 48 8b 40 [ 0.414540]RSP: 0000:ffffb71480013ae0 EFLAGS: 00010086 [ 0.414540] RAX:0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa099c2722000 RCX: 0000000000000000 [ 0.414540]RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffb71480013998 RDI: 0000000000000001 [0.414540] RBP: 0000000000000246 R08: 00000000ffffdfff R09: 0000000000000001[ 0.414540] R10: 00000000ffffdfff R11: ffffffffb18729c0 R12:ffffa099c1c91760 [ 0.414540] R13: ffffa099c1c916a4 R14: ffffa099c1d2f200R15: ffffa099c1c91600 [ 0.414540] FS: 0000000000000000(0000)GS:ffffa099fec40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 [ 0.414540] CS: 0010 DS:0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 [ 0.414540] CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3:0000000008e3e001 CR4: 0000000000370ef0 [ 0.414540] Call Trace: [ 0.414540]<TASK> [ 0.414540] ? __warn+0x80/0x120 [ 0.414540] ? free_irq+0x1a1/0x2d0 [0.414540] ? report_bug+0x164/0x190 [ 0.414540] ? handle_bug+0x3b/0x70 [0.414540] ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70 [ 0.414540] ?asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 [ 0.414540] ? free_irq+0x1a1/0x2d0 [ 0.414540]vp_del_vqs+0xc1/0x220 [ 0.414540] vp_find_vqs_msix+0x305/0x470 [ 0.414540]vp_find_vqs+0x3e/0x1a0 [ 0.414540] vp_modern_find_vqs+0x1b/0x70 [ 0.414540]init_vqs+0x387/0x600 [ 0.414540] virtnet_probe+0x50a/0xc80 [ 0.414540]virtio_dev_probe+0x1e0/0x2b0 [ 0.414540] really_probe+0xc0/0x2c0 [0.414540] ? __pfx___driver_attach+0x10/0x10 [ 0.414540]__driver_probe_device+0x73/0x120 [ 0.414540] driver_probe_device+0x1f/0xe0[ 0.414540] __driver_attach+0x88/0x180 [ 0.414540]bus_for_each_dev+0x85/0xd0 [ 0.414540] bus_add_driver+0xec/0x1f0 [0.414540] driver_register+0x59/0x100 [ 0.414540] ?__pfx_virtio_net_driver_init+0x10/0x10 [ 0.414540]virtio_net_driver_init+0x90/0xb0 [ 0.414540] do_one_initcall+0x58/0x230 [0.414540] kernel_init_freeable+0x1a3/0x2d0 [ 0.414540] ?__pfx_kernel_init+0x10/0x10 [ 0.414540] kernel_init+0x1a/0x1c0 [ 0.414540]ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50 [ 0.414540] ? __pfx_kernel_init+0x10/0x10 [0.414540] ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 [ 0.414540] </TASK> Fix this bycalling deleting the current vq when request_irq() fails.",
