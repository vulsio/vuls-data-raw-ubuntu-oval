    "Title": "CVE-2022-2964 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes. Jann Horn discovered that the ASIX AX88179/178A USB Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained multiple out-of-bounds vulnerabilities. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2964` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-aws - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1078.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-bluefield - 5.4.0-1040.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-kvm - 5.4.0-1063.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1027-oem - 5.14.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-raspi - 5.4.0-1060.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-aws - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1078.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-bluefield - 5.4.0-1040.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-kvm - 5.4.0-1063.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1027-oem - 5.14.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77\nNo subscription required",
