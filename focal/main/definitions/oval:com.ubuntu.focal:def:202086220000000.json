    "Title": "CVE-2020-8622 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -> 9.17.3, also affects 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, An attacker on the network path for a TSIG-signed request, or operating the server receiving the TSIG-signed request, could send a truncated response to that request, triggering an assertion failure, causing the server to exit. Alternately, an off-path attacker would have to correctly guess when a TSIG-signed request was sent, along with other characteristics of the packet and message, and spoof a truncated response to trigger an assertion failure, causing the server to exit.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-8622` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbind9 - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.3\nbind9-dnsutils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.3\nbind9-host - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.3\nbind9-libs - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.3\nbind9-utils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.3\nbind9utils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.3\ndnsutils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.3\nNo subscription required",
