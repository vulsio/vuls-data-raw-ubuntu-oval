    "Title": "CVE-2022-1184 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernelâ€™s filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1184` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-aws - 5.15.0-1030.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-azure - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gcp - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-oracle - 5.15.0-1029.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1091-raspi - 5.4.0-1091.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-aws - 5.15.0-1030.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-azure - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gcp - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-oracle - 5.15.0-1029.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1027-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1027.31\nNo subscription required",
