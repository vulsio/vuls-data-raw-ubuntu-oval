		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: bridge: switchdev: Skip MDB replays of deferred events on offloadBefore this change, generation of the list of MDB events to replaywould race against the creation of new group memberships, either fromthe IGMP/MLD snooping logic or from user configuration.While new memberships are immediately visible to walkers ofbr->mdb_list, the notification of their existence to switchdev eventsubscribers is deferred until a later point in time. So if a replaylist was generated during a time that overlapped with such a window,it would also contain a replay of the not-yet-delivered event.The driver would thus receive two copies of what the bridge internallyconsidered to be one single event. On destruction of the bridge, onlya single membership deletion event was therefore sent. As aconsequence of this, drivers which reference count memberships (atleast DSA), would be left with orphan groups in their hardwaredatabase when the bridge was destroyed.This is only an issue when replaying additions. While deletion eventsmay still be pending on the deferred queue, they will already havebeen removed from br->mdb_list, so no duplicates can be generated inthat scenario.To a user this meant that old group memberships, from a bridge inwhich a port was previously attached, could be reanimated (inhardware) when the port joined a new bridge, without the new bridge'sknowledge.For example, on an mv88e6xxx system, create a snooping bridge andimmediately add a port to it:    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br0 up type bridgemcast_snooping 1 && \\    > ip link set dev x3 up master br0And then destroy the bridge:    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link del dev br0    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ mvls atu    ADDRESS             FID  STATE      Q  F  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9a    DEV:0 Marvell 88E6393X    33:33:00:00:00:6a     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ..    33:33:ff:87:e4:3f     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ..    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     1  static     -  -  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9a    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$The two IPv6 groups remain in the hardware database because theport (x3) is notified of the host's membership twice: once via theoriginal event and once via a replay. Since only a single deletenotification is sent, the count remains at 1 when the bridge isdestroyed.Then add the same port (or another port belonging to the same hardwaredomain) to a new bridge, this time with snooping disabled:    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br1 up type bridgemcast_snooping 0 && \\    > ip link set dev x3 up master br1All multicast, including the two IPv6 groups from br0, should now beflooded, according to the policy of br1. But instead the oldmemberships are still active in the hardware database, causing theswitch to only forward traffic to those groups towards the CPU (port0).Eliminate the race in two steps:1. Grab the write-side lock of the MDB while generating the replay   list.This prevents new memberships from showing up while we are generatingthe replay list. But it leaves the scenario in which a deferred eventwas already generated, but not delivered, before we grabbed thelock. Therefore:2. Make sure that no deferred version of a replay event is already   enqueued to the switchdev deferred queue, before adding it to the   replay list, when replaying additions.",
