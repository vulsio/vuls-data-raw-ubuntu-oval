		"description": "Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate largeamounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lackof free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has beenexploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions(ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from aclient whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clientsthat are not permitted to send updates is released immediately uponrejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trustedclients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic updateis REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it isonly likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood ofunaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query floodintended to achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlierbranches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resourcesrather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should notbe a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend toaddress this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3094` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbind9 - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.12\nbind9-dnsutils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.12\nbind9-host - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.12\nbind9-libs - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.12\nbind9-utils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.12\nbind9utils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.12\ndnsutils - 1:9.16.1-0ubuntu2.12\nNo subscription required",
