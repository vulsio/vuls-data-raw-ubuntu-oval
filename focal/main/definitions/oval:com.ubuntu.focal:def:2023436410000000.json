		"Title": "CVE-2023-43641 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "libcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets. Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-43641` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibcue2 - 2.2.1-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
