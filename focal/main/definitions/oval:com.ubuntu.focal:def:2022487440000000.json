		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Avoid field-overflowing memcpy()In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-timefield bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoidintentionally writing across neighboring fields.Use flexible arrays instead of zero-element arrays (which look like theyare always overflowing) and split the cross-field memcpy() into two halvesthat can be appropriately bounds-checked by the compiler.We were doing:\t#define ETH_HLEN  14\t#define VLAN_HLEN  4\t...\t#define MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE (ETH_HLEN + VLAN_HLEN)\t...        struct mlx5e_tx_wqe      *wqe  = mlx5_wq_cyc_get_wqe(wq, pi);\t...        struct mlx5_wqe_eth_seg  *eseg = &wqe->eth;        struct mlx5_wqe_data_seg *dseg = wqe->data;\t...\tmemcpy(eseg->inline_hdr.start, xdptxd->data, MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE);target is wqe->eth.inline_hdr.start (which the compiler sees as being2 bytes in size), but copying 18, intending to write across start(really vlan_tci, 2 bytes). The remaining 16 bytes get written intowqe->data[0], covering byte_count (4 bytes), lkey (4 bytes), and addr(8 bytes).struct mlx5e_tx_wqe {        struct mlx5_wqe_ctrl_seg   ctrl;                 /*     0    16 */        struct mlx5_wqe_eth_seg    eth;                  /*    16    16 */        struct mlx5_wqe_data_seg   data[];               /*    32     0 */        /* size: 32, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */        /* last cacheline: 32 bytes */};struct mlx5_wqe_eth_seg {        u8                         swp_outer_l4_offset;  /*     0     1 */        u8                         swp_outer_l3_offset;  /*     1     1 */        u8                         swp_inner_l4_offset;  /*     2     1 */        u8                         swp_inner_l3_offset;  /*     3     1 */        u8                         cs_flags;             /*     4     1 */        u8                         swp_flags;            /*     5     1 */        __be16                     mss;                  /*     6     2 */        __be32                     flow_table_metadata;  /*     8     4 */        union {                struct {                        __be16     sz;                   /*    12     2 */                        u8         start[2];             /*    14     2 */                } inline_hdr;                            /*    12     4 */                struct {                        __be16     type;                 /*    12     2 */                        __be16     vlan_tci;             /*    14     2 */                } insert;                                /*    12     4 */                __be32             trailer;              /*    12     4 */        };                                               /*    12     4 */        /* size: 16, cachelines: 1, members: 9 */        /* last cacheline: 16 bytes */};struct mlx5_wqe_data_seg {        __be32                     byte_count;           /*     0     4 */        __be32                     lkey;                 /*     4     4 */        __be64                     addr;                 /*     8     8 */        /* size: 16, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */        /* last cacheline: 16 bytes */};So, split the memcpy() so the compiler can reason about the buffersizes.\"pahole\" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct mlx5e_tx_wqenor struct mlx5e_umr_wqe. \"objdump -d\" shows no meaningful objectcode changes (i.e. only source line number induced differences andoptimizations).",
