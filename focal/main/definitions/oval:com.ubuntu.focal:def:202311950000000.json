		"Title": "CVE-2023-1195 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in reconn_set_ipaddr_from_hostname in fs/cifs/connect.c in the Linux kernel. The issue occurs when it forgets to set the free pointer server->hostname to NULL, leading to an invalid pointer request. It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a user-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1195` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-99-generic - 5.4.0-99.112\nlinux-image-5.4.0-99-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-99.112\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-99-generic - 5.4.0-99.112\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-99-lowlatency - 5.4.0-99.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-aws - 5.4.0-1065.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-bluefield - 5.4.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-gcp - 5.4.0-1064.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-gke - 5.4.0-1062.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gkeop - 5.4.0-1033.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1014-ibm - 5.4.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-kvm - 5.4.0-1055.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-oracle - 5.4.0-1063.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-99-generic - 5.4.0-99.112\nlinux-image-5.4.0-99-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-99.112\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-99-generic - 5.4.0-99.112\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-99-lowlatency - 5.4.0-99.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-aws - 5.4.0-1065.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-bluefield - 5.4.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-gcp - 5.4.0-1064.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-gke - 5.4.0-1062.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gkeop - 5.4.0-1033.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1014-ibm - 5.4.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-kvm - 5.4.0-1055.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-oracle - 5.4.0-1063.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
