		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:smartpqi: Fix disable_managed_interrupts Correct blk-mq registration issuewith module parameter disable_managed_interrupts enabled. When we turn offthe default PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY flag, the driver needs to register with blk-mqusing blk_mq_map_queues(). The driver is currently callingblk_mq_pci_map_queues() which results in a stack trace and possiblyundefined behavior.
