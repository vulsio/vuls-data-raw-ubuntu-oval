		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing: Restructure trace_clock_global() to never block It was reportedthat a fix to the ring buffer recursion detection would cause a hungmachine when performing suspend / resume testing. The following backtracewas extracted from debugging that case: Call Trace:trace_clock_global+0x91/0xa0 __rb_reserve_next+0x237/0x460ring_buffer_lock_reserve+0x12a/0x3f0 trace_buffer_lock_reserve+0x10/0x50__trace_graph_return+0x1f/0x80 trace_graph_return+0xb7/0xf0 ?trace_clock_global+0x91/0xa0 ftrace_return_to_handler+0x8b/0xf0 ?pv_hash+0xa0/0xa0 return_to_handler+0x15/0x30 ?ftrace_graph_caller+0xa0/0xa0 ? trace_clock_global+0x91/0xa0 ?__rb_reserve_next+0x237/0x460 ? ring_buffer_lock_reserve+0x12a/0x3f0 ?trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve+0x3c/0x120 ?trace_event_buffer_reserve+0x6b/0xc0 ?trace_event_raw_event_device_pm_callback_start+0x125/0x2d0 ?dpm_run_callback+0x3b/0xc0 ? pm_ops_is_empty+0x50/0x50 ?platform_get_irq_byname_optional+0x90/0x90 ?trace_device_pm_callback_start+0x82/0xd0 ? dpm_run_callback+0x49/0xc0 Withthe following RIP: RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x69/0x200Since the fix to the recursion detection would allow a single recursion tohappen while tracing, this lead to the trace_clock_global() taking a spinlock and then trying to take it again: ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {trace_clock_global() { arch_spin_lock() { queued_spin_lock_slowpath() { /*lock taken */ (something else gets traced by function graph tracer)ring_buffer_lock_reserve() { trace_clock_global() { arch_spin_lock() {queued_spin_lock_slowpath() { /* DEAD LOCK! */ Tracing should *never*block, as it can lead to strange lockups like the above. Restructure thetrace_clock_global() code to instead of simply taking a lock to update therecorded \"prev_time\" simply use it, as two events happening on twodifferent CPUs that calls this at the same time, really doesn't matterwhich one goes first. Use a trylock to grab the lock for updating theprev_time, and if it fails, simply try again the next time. If it failed tobe taken, that means something else is already updating it.
