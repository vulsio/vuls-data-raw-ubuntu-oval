		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: geneve:fix header validation in geneve[6]_xmit_skb syzbot is able to trigger anuninit-value in geneve_xmit() [1] Problem : While most ip tunnel helpers(like ip_tunnel_get_dsfield()) uses skb_protocol(skb, true),pskb_inet_may_pull() is only using skb->protocol. If anything else thanETH_P_IPV6 or ETH_P_IP is found in skb->protocol, pskb_inet_may_pull() doesnothing at all. If a vlan tag was provided by the caller (af_packet in thesyzbot case), the network header might not point to the correct location,and skb linear part could be smaller than expected. Addskb_vlan_inet_prepare() to perform a complete mac validation. Use this ingeneve for the moment, I suspect we need to adopt this more broadly. v4 -Jakub reported v3 broke l2_tos_ttl_inherit.sh selftest - Only call__vlan_get_protocol() for vlan types. v2,v3 - Addressed Sabrina comments onv1 and v2 [1] BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in geneve_xmit_skbdrivers/net/geneve.c:910 [inline] BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value ingeneve_xmit+0x302d/0x5420 drivers/net/geneve.c:1030 geneve_xmit_skbdrivers/net/geneve.c:910 [inline] geneve_xmit+0x302d/0x5420drivers/net/geneve.c:1030 __netdev_start_xmitinclude/linux/netdevice.h:4903 [inline] netdev_start_xmitinclude/linux/netdevice.h:4917 [inline] xmit_one net/core/dev.c:3531[inline] dev_hard_start_xmit+0x247/0xa20 net/core/dev.c:3547__dev_queue_xmit+0x348d/0x52c0 net/core/dev.c:4335 dev_queue_xmitinclude/linux/netdevice.h:3091 [inline] packet_xmit+0x9c/0x6c0net/packet/af_packet.c:276 packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3081 [inline]packet_sendmsg+0x8bb0/0x9ef0 net/packet/af_packet.c:3113 sock_sendmsg_nosecnet/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x30f/0x380 net/socket.c:745__sys_sendto+0x685/0x830 net/socket.c:2191 __do_sys_sendtonet/socket.c:2203 [inline] __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2199 [inline]__x64_sys_sendto+0x125/0x1d0 net/socket.c:2199 do_syscall_64+0xd5/0x1f0entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6d/0x75 Uninit was created at:slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:3804 [inline] slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:3845[inline] kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x613/0xc50 mm/slub.c:3888kmalloc_reserve+0x13d/0x4a0 net/core/skbuff.c:577 __alloc_skb+0x35b/0x7a0net/core/skbuff.c:668 alloc_skb include/linux/skbuff.h:1318 [inline]alloc_skb_with_frags+0xc8/0xbf0 net/core/skbuff.c:6504sock_alloc_send_pskb+0xa81/0xbf0 net/core/sock.c:2795 packet_alloc_skbnet/packet/af_packet.c:2930 [inline] packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3024[inline] packet_sendmsg+0x722d/0x9ef0 net/packet/af_packet.c:3113sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x30f/0x380net/socket.c:745 __sys_sendto+0x685/0x830 net/socket.c:2191 __do_sys_sendtonet/socket.c:2203 [inline] __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2199 [inline]__x64_sys_sendto+0x125/0x1d0 net/socket.c:2199 do_syscall_64+0xd5/0x1f0entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6d/0x75 CPU: 0 PID: 5033 Comm:syz-executor346 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc1-syzkaller-00005-g928a87efa423 #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 02/29/2024",
