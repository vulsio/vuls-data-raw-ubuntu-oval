		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm, slub: do not call do_slab_free for kfence objectIn 782f8906f805 the freeing of kfence objects was moved from deepinside do_slab_free to the wrapper functions outside. This is a nicechange, but unfortunately it missed one spot in __kmem_cache_free_bulk.This results in a crash like this:BUG skbuff_head_cache (Tainted: G S  B       E     ): Padding overwritten.0xffff88907fea0f00-0xffff88907fea0fff @offset=3840slab_err (mm/slub.c:1129)free_to_partial_list (mm/slub.c:? mm/slub.c:4036)slab_pad_check (mm/slub.c:864 mm/slub.c:1290)check_slab (mm/slub.c:?)free_to_partial_list (mm/slub.c:3171 mm/slub.c:4036)kmem_cache_alloc_bulk (mm/slub.c:? mm/slub.c:4495 mm/slub.c:4586mm/slub.c:4635)napi_build_skb (net/core/skbuff.c:348 net/core/skbuff.c:527net/core/skbuff.c:549)All the other callers to do_slab_free appear to be ok.Add a kfence_free check in __kmem_cache_free_bulk to avoid the crash.",
