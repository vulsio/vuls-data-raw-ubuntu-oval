		"description": "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in ApacheZooKeeper. If SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled in ZooKeeper(quorum.auth.enableSasl=true), the authorization is done by verifying thatthe instance part in SASL authentication ID is listed in zoo.cfg serverlist. The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional and if it's missing,like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM', the authorization check will be skipped. As aresult an arbitrary endpoint could join the cluster and begin propagatingcounterfeit changes to the leader, essentially giving it completeread-write access to the data tree. Quorum Peer authentication is notenabled by default. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1,3.8.3, 3.7.2, which fixes the issue. Alternately ensure the ensembleelection/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this willmitigate the issue. See the documentation for more details on correctcluster administration.",
