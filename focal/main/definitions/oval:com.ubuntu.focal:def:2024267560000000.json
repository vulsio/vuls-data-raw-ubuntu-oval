		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: md:Don't register sync_thread for reshape directly Currently, if reshape isinterrupted, then reassemble the array will register sync_thread directlyfrom pers->run(), in this case 'MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING' is set directly,however, there is no guarantee that md_do_sync() will be executed, hencestop_sync_thread() will hang because 'MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING' can't becleared. Last patch make sure that md_do_sync() will set MD_RECOVERY_DONE,however, following hang can still be triggered by dm-raid testshell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh occasionally: [root@fedora ~]# cat/proc/1982/stack [<0>] stop_sync_thread+0x1ab/0x270 [md_mod] [<0>]md_frozen_sync_thread+0x5c/0xa0 [md_mod] [<0>] raid_presuspend+0x1e/0x70[dm_raid] [<0>] dm_table_presuspend_targets+0x40/0xb0 [dm_mod] [<0>]__dm_destroy+0x2a5/0x310 [dm_mod] [<0>] dm_destroy+0x16/0x30 [dm_mod] [<0>]dev_remove+0x165/0x290 [dm_mod] [<0>] ctl_ioctl+0x4bb/0x7b0 [dm_mod] [<0>]dm_ctl_ioctl+0x11/0x20 [dm_mod] [<0>] vfs_ioctl+0x21/0x60 [<0>]__x64_sys_ioctl+0xb9/0xe0 [<0>] do_syscall_64+0xc6/0x230 [<0>]entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6c/0x74 Meanwhile mddev->recovery is:MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING | MD_RECOVERY_INTR | MD_RECOVERY_RESHAPE |MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN Fix this problem by remove the code to registersync_thread directly from raid10 and raid5.
