		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:erofs: fix out-of-bound access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially failsIf z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails on a global buffer due tomemory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported by syzbot [1]),new pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoidmemory leaks.However, the old gbuf->pages[] array may not be large enough, which canlead to null-ptr-deref or out-of-bound access.Fix this by checking against gbuf->nrpages in advance.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/r/000000000000f7b96e062018c6e3@google.com\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46688` to fix the vulnerability.
