		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/kmemleak: avoid scanning potential huge holesWhen using devm_request_free_mem_region() and devm_memremap_pages() toadd ZONE_DEVICE memory, if requested free mem region's end pfn werehuge(e.g., 0x400000000), the node_end_pfn() will be also huge (seemove_pfn_range_to_zone()).  Thus it creates a huge hole betweennode_start_pfn() and node_end_pfn().We found on some AMD APUs, amdkfd requested such a free mem region andcreated a huge hole.  In such a case, following code snippet was justdoing busy test_bit() looping on the huge hole.  for (pfn = start_pfn; pfn < end_pfn; pfn++) {\tstruct page *page = pfn_to_online_page(pfn);\t\tif (!page)\t\t\tcontinue;\t...  }So we got a soft lockup:  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#6 stuck for 26s!
