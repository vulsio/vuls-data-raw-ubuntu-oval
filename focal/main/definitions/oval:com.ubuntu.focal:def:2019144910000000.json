    "Title": "CVE-2019-14491 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 3.4.7 and 4.x before 4.1.1. There is an out of bounds read in the function cv::predictOrdered<cv::HaarEvaluator> in modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp, which leads to denial of service. It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-14491` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibopencv-calib3d4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-contrib4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-core4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-dnn4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-features2d4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-flann4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-highgui4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-imgcodecs4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-imgproc4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-ml4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-objdetect4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-photo4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-shape4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-stitching4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-superres4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-video4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-videoio4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-videostab4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv-viz4.2 - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv4.2-java - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nlibopencv4.2-jni - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nopencv-data - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\npython3-opencv - 4.2.0+dfsg-5\nNo subscription required",

    "Note": "ccdm94> in xenial and earlier, it is necessary to backport the fix for this CVE. However, changes in the code that have occurred since the release of versions available in xenial and earlier cause this backport to be quite intrusive. To backport and properly apply the patch, it would be necessary to alter library functions that are exported, meaning that it would be necessary to alter their interfaces, which could end up causing regressions in software that uses the opencv library to operate. It also seems like a backported version of the patch does not completely fix the vulnerability, with the POC file causing a similar crash, even after the fix is applied."
