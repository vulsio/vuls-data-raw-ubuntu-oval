		"description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header andonly look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it wouldfall through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to theHTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with theinner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, endingwith chunked. Requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\" wouldincorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length headerinstead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allowfor Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case ofHTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-16786` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-waitress - 1.4.1-1\nNo subscription required",
