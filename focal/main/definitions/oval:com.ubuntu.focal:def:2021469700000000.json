		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bus: mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueueA recent change created a dedicated workqueue for the state-change workwith WQ_HIGHPRI (no strong reason for that) and WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags,but the state-change work (mhi_pm_st_worker) does not guarantee forwardprogress under memory pressure, and will even wait on various memoryallocations when e.g. creating devices, loading firmware, etc... Thework is then not part of a memory reclaim path...Moreover, this causes a warning in check_flush_dependency() since we endup in code that flushes a non-reclaim workqueue:[   40.969601] workqueue: WQ_MEM_RECLAIM mhi_hiprio_wq:mhi_pm_st_worker[mhi] is flushing !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM events_highpri:flush_backlog[   40.969612] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 158 at kernel/workqueue.c:2607check_flush_dependency+0x11c/0x140[   40.969733] Call Trace:[   40.969740]  __flush_work+0x97/0x1d0[   40.969745]  ? wake_up_process+0x15/0x20[   40.969749]  ? insert_work+0x70/0x80[   40.969750]  ? __queue_work+0x14a/0x3e0[   40.969753]  flush_work+0x10/0x20[   40.969756]  rollback_registered_many+0x1c9/0x510[   40.969759]  unregister_netdevice_queue+0x94/0x120[   40.969761]  unregister_netdev+0x1d/0x30[   40.969765]  mhi_net_remove+0x1a/0x40 [mhi_net][   40.969770]  mhi_driver_remove+0x124/0x250 [mhi][   40.969776]  device_release_driver_internal+0xf0/0x1d0[   40.969778]  device_release_driver+0x12/0x20[   40.969782]  bus_remove_device+0xe1/0x150[   40.969786]  device_del+0x17b/0x3e0[   40.969791]  mhi_destroy_device+0x9a/0x100 [mhi][   40.969796]  ? mhi_unmap_single_use_bb+0x50/0x50 [mhi][   40.969799]  device_for_each_child+0x5e/0xa0[   40.969804]  mhi_pm_st_worker+0x921/0xf50 [mhi]",
