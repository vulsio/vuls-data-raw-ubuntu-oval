		"description": "grant table v2 status pages may remain accessible after de-allocation Guestget permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority ofsuch pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entirelifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when aguest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requiresthat the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. Thehypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests fromthe guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them tobecome mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, theguest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-usedfor other purposes.",
