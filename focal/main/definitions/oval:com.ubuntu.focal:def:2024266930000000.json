		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix a crash when we run out of stationsA DoS tool that injects loads of authentication frames made our APcrash. The iwl_mvm_is_dup() function couldn't find the per-queuedup_data which was not allocated.The root cause for that is that we ran out of stations in the firmwareand we didn't really add the station to the firmware, yet we didn'treturn an error to mac80211.Mac80211 was thinking that we have the station and because of that,sta_info::uploaded was set to 1. This allowedieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() to return a valid station object, butthat ieee80211_sta didn't have any iwl_mvm_sta object initialized andthat caused the crash mentioned earlier when we got Rx on that station.",
