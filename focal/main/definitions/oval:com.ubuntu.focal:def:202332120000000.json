		"Title": "CVE-2023-3212 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference issue was found in the gfs2 file system in the Linux kernel. It occurs on corrupt gfs2 file systems when the evict code tries to reference the journal descriptor structure after it has been freed and set to NULL. A privileged local user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic. Yang Lan discovered that the GFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious GFS2 image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3212` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-lowlatency - 5.4.0-164.181\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-aws - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-azure - 5.4.0-1117.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-bluefield - 5.4.0-1072.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-gcp - 5.4.0-1115.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gkeop - 5.4.0-1078.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-ibm - 5.4.0-1058.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-kvm - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-oracle - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1095-raspi - 5.4.0-1095.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-lowlatency - 5.4.0-164.181\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-aws - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-azure - 5.4.0-1117.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-bluefield - 5.4.0-1072.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-gcp - 5.4.0-1115.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gkeop - 5.4.0-1078.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-ibm - 5.4.0-1058.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-kvm - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-oracle - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1031-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required",
