Therefore call fscache_withdraw_volume() before callingcachefiles_withdraw_objects().This way, after setting FSCACHE_CACHE_IS_WITHDRAWN, only the following twocases will occur:1) fscache_begin_lookup fails in fscache_begin_volume_access().2) fscache_withdraw_volume() will ensure that fscache_count_object() has   been executed before calling fscache_wait_for_objects().",
