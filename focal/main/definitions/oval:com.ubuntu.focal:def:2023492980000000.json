		"Description": "OpenZFS through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1, in certain scenariosinvolving applications that try to rely on efficient copying of file data,can replace file contents with zero-valued bytes and thus potentiallydisable security mechanisms. NOTE: this issue is not always securityrelated, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possibleexample is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, whenattempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access. (Onemight use cp when configuring access control, such as with the/etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: thisissue occurs less often in version 2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4,because of the default configuration in those versions.",
