		"Title": "CVE-2023-1073 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1073` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-147.164\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-aws - 5.4.0-1100.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-aws - 5.15.0-1034.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-azure - 5.4.0-1106.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-azure - 5.15.0-1036.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1106.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1036.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-bluefield - 5.4.0-1062.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-gcp - 5.4.0-1103.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gcp - 5.15.0-1032.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gke - 5.4.0-1097.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gke - 5.15.0-1031.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-gkeop - 5.4.0-1067.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-70-generic - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-70-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-generic - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-generic-64k - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-ibm - 5.4.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-kvm - 5.4.0-1089.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-lowlatency - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-oracle - 5.4.0-1099.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-oracle - 5.15.0-1033.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1083-raspi - 5.4.0-1083.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-147.164\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-aws - 5.4.0-1100.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-aws - 5.15.0-1034.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-azure - 5.4.0-1106.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-azure - 5.15.0-1036.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1106.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1036.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-bluefield - 5.4.0-1062.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-gcp - 5.4.0-1103.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gcp - 5.15.0-1032.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gke - 5.4.0-1097.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gke - 5.15.0-1031.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-gkeop - 5.4.0-1067.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-70-generic - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-70-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-generic - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-generic-64k - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-ibm - 5.4.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-kvm - 5.4.0-1089.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-lowlatency - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-70-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-70.77~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-oracle - 5.4.0-1099.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-oracle - 5.15.0-1033.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1024.28\nNo subscription required",
