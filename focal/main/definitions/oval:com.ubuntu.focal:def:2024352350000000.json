		"description": "OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and otherUnix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when startingthe cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symboliclink, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of theprovided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Giventhat cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change ofpermission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given theaforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerabilityis limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specificcase it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listenargument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.confconfiguration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments incups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a`FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root)command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntusystems to achieve full root command execution. Commitff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35235` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncups - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-bsd - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-client - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-common - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-core-drivers - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-daemon - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-ipp-utils - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-ppdc - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\ncups-server-common - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\nlibcups2 - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\nlibcupsimage2 - 2.3.1-9ubuntu1.7\nNo subscription required",
