		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:fix LAG and VF lock dependency in ice_reset_vf() 9f74a3dfcf83 (\"ice: Fix VFReset paths when interface in a failed over aggregate\"), the ice driver hasacquired the LAG mutex in ice_reset_vf(). The commit placed this lockacquisition just prior to the acquisition of the VF configuration lock. Ifice_reset_vf() acquires the configuration lock via the ICE_VF_RESET_LOCKflag, this could deadlock with ice_vc_cfg_qs_msg() because it alwaysacquires the locks in the order of the VF configuration lock and then theLAG mutex. Lockdep reports this violation almost immediately on creatingand then removing 2 VF:====================================================== WARNING: possiblecircular locking dependency detected 6.8.0-rc6 #54 Tainted: G W O------------------------------------------------------ kworker/60:3/6771 istrying to acquire lock: ff40d43e099380a0 (&vf->cfg_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at:ice_reset_vf+0x22f/0x4d0 [ice] but task is already holding lock:ff40d43ea1961210 (&pf->lag_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: ice_reset_vf+0xb7/0x4d0[ice] which lock already depends on the new lock. the existing dependencychain (in reverse order) is: -> #1 (&pf->lag_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}:__lock_acquire+0x4f8/0xb40 lock_acquire+0xd4/0x2d0 __mutex_lock+0x9b/0xbf0ice_vc_cfg_qs_msg+0x45/0x690 [ice] ice_vc_process_vf_msg+0x4f5/0x870 [ice]__ice_clean_ctrlq+0x2b5/0x600 [ice] ice_service_task+0x2c9/0x480 [ice]process_one_work+0x1e9/0x4d0 worker_thread+0x1e1/0x3d0 kthread+0x104/0x140ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 -> #0(&vf->cfg_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}: check_prev_add+0xe2/0xc50validate_chain+0x558/0x800 __lock_acquire+0x4f8/0xb40lock_acquire+0xd4/0x2d0 __mutex_lock+0x9b/0xbf0 ice_reset_vf+0x22f/0x4d0[ice] ice_process_vflr_event+0x98/0xd0 [ice] ice_service_task+0x1cc/0x480[ice] process_one_work+0x1e9/0x4d0 worker_thread+0x1e1/0x3d0kthread+0x104/0x140 ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30other info that might help us debug this: Possible unsafe locking scenario:CPU0 CPU1 ---- ---- lock(&pf->lag_mutex); lock(&vf->cfg_lock);lock(&pf->lag_mutex); lock(&vf->cfg_lock); *** DEADLOCK *** 4 locks held bykworker/60:3/6771: #0: ff40d43e05428b38 ((wq_completion)ice){+.+.}-{0:0},at: process_one_work+0x176/0x4d0 #1: ff50d06e05197e58((work_completion)(&pf->serv_task)){+.+.}-{0:0}, at:process_one_work+0x176/0x4d0 #2: ff40d43ea1960e50(&pf->vfs.table_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: ice_process_vflr_event+0x48/0xd0[ice] #3: ff40d43ea1961210 (&pf->lag_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at:ice_reset_vf+0xb7/0x4d0 [ice] stack backtrace: CPU: 60 PID: 6771 Comm:kworker/60:3 Tainted: G W O 6.8.0-rc6 #54 Hardware name: Workqueue: iceice_service_task [ice] Call Trace: <TASK> dump_stack_lvl+0x4a/0x80check_noncircular+0x12d/0x150 check_prev_add+0xe2/0xc50 ?save_trace+0x59/0x230 ? add_chain_cache+0x109/0x450validate_chain+0x558/0x800 __lock_acquire+0x4f8/0xb40 ?lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x7d/0x100 lock_acquire+0xd4/0x2d0 ?ice_reset_vf+0x22f/0x4d0 [ice] ? lock_is_held_type+0xc7/0x120__mutex_lock+0x9b/0xbf0 ? ice_reset_vf+0x22f/0x4d0 [ice] ?ice_reset_vf+0x22f/0x4d0 [ice] ? rcu_is_watching+0x11/0x50 ?ice_reset_vf+0x22f/0x4d0 [ice] ice_reset_vf+0x22f/0x4d0 [ice] ?process_one_work+0x176/0x4d0 ice_process_vflr_event+0x98/0xd0 [ice]ice_service_task+0x1cc/0x480 [ice] process_one_work+0x1e9/0x4d0worker_thread+0x1e1/0x3d0 ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10kthread+0x104/0x140 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50 ?__pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 </TASK> To avoiddeadlock, we must acquire the LAG ---truncated---",
