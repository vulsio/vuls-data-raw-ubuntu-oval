		"description": "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2,there is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition ofthe `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the`wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy causes the functionimplementation to perform a 4-byte write into a 1-byte buffer provided bythe caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written beyond the1-byte location provided by the caller. This bug has been patched and usersshould upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around byproviding a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when calling`wasmtime_trap_code`. Users of the `wasmtime` crate are not affected bythis issue, only users of the C API function `wasmtime_trap_code` areaffected.",
