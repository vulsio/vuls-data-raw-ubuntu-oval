		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:fix vsi->txq_map sizing The approach of having XDP queue per CPU regardlessof user's setting exposed a hidden bug that could occur in case when Rxqueue count differ from Tx queue count. Currently vsi->txq_map's size isequal to the doubled vsi->alloc_txq, which is not correct due to the factthat XDP rings were previously based on the Rx queue count. Below splat canbe seen when ethtool -L is used and XDP rings are configured: [ 682.875339]BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000000f [682.883403] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode [ 682.889345] #PF:error_code(0x0000) - not-present page [ 682.895289] PGD 0 P4D 0 [682.898218] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI [ 682.903055] CPU: 42 PID: 2878Comm: ethtool Tainted: G OE 5.15.0-rc5+ #1 [ 682.912214] Hardware name:Intel Corp.
