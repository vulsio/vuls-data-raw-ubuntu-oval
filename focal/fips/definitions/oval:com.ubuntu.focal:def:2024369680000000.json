		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix div-by-zero in l2cap_le_flowctl_init()l2cap_le_flowctl_init() can cause both div-by-zero and an integeroverflow since hdev->le_mtu may not fall in the valid range.Move MTU from hci_dev to hci_conn to validate MTU and stop the connectionprocess earlier if MTU is invalid.Also, add a missing validation in read_buffer_size() and make it returnan error value if the validation fails.Now hci_conn_add() returns ERR_PTR() as it can fail due to the both akzalloc failure and invalid MTU value.divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTICPU: 0 PID: 67 Comm: kworker/u5:0 Tainted: G        W          6.9.0-rc5+#20Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-104/01/2014Workqueue: hci0 hci_rx_workRIP: 0010:l2cap_le_flowctl_init+0x19e/0x3f0 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:547Code: e8 17 17 0c 00 66 41 89 9f 84 00 00 00 bf 01 00 00 00 41 b8 02 00 0000 4c89 fe 4c 89 e2 89 d9 e8 27 17 0c 00 44 89 f0 31 d2 <66> f7 f3 89 c3 ff c34d 8db7 88 00 00 00 4c 89 f0 48 c1 e8 03 42RSP: 0018:ffff88810bc0f858 EFLAGS: 00010246RAX: 00000000000002a0 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: dffffc0000000000RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffff88810bc0f7c0 RDI: ffffc90002dcb66fRBP: ffff88810bc0f880 R08: aa69db2dda70ff01 R09: 0000ffaaaaaaaaaaR10: 0084000000ffaaaa R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff88810d65a084R13: dffffc0000000000 R14: 00000000000002a0 R15: ffff88810d65a000FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88811ac00000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 0000000020000100 CR3: 0000000103268003 CR4: 0000000000770ef0PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <TASK> l2cap_le_connect_req net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:4902 [inline] l2cap_le_sig_cmd net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:5420 [inline] l2cap_le_sig_channel net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:5486 [inline] l2cap_recv_frame+0xe59d/0x11710 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:6809 l2cap_recv_acldata+0x544/0x10a0 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:7506 hci_acldata_packet net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:3939 [inline] hci_rx_work+0x5e5/0xb20 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:4176 process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3254 [inline] process_scheduled_works+0x90f/0x1530 kernel/workqueue.c:3335 worker_thread+0x926/0xe70 kernel/workqueue.c:3416 kthread+0x2e3/0x380 kernel/kthread.c:388 ret_from_fork+0x5c/0x90 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244 </TASK>Modules linked in:---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",
