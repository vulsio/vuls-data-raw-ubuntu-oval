		"description": "Git is a revision control system. The Git project recommends to avoidworking in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `gitclone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections tomake that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, butvulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context ofcloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability hasbeen covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixesfor CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip`file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trustedby default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within thecontext of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As aworkaround, avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained viaarchives from untrusted sources.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-32465` to fix the vulnerability.
