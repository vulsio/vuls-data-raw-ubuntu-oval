		"title": "CVE-2021-46953 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ACPI:GTDT: Don't corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure Whenfailing the driver probe because of invalid firmware properties, the GTDTdriver unmaps the interrupt that it mapped earlier. However, it neverchecks whether the mapping of the interrupt actially succeeded. Even more,should the firmware report an illegal interrupt number that overlaps withthe GIC SGI range, this can result in an IPI being unmapped, and subsequentfireworks (as reported by Dann Frazier). Rework the driver to have aslightly saner behaviour and actually check whether the interrupt has beenmapped before unmapping things.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46953` to fix the vulnerability.
