    "Title": "CVE-2023-3111 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use after free vulnerability was found in prepare_to_relocate in fs/btrfs/relocation.c in btrfs in the Linux Kernel. This possible flaw can be triggered by calling btrfs_ioctl_balance() before calling btrfs_ioctl_defrag(). It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3111` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-aws - 5.15.0-1023.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-azure - 5.15.0-1023.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1023.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-gcp - 5.15.0-1022.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gke - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic-64k - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-oracle - 5.15.0-1022.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1091-raspi - 5.4.0-1091.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-aws - 5.15.0-1023.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-azure - 5.15.0-1023.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1023.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-gcp - 5.15.0-1022.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gke - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-generic-64k - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-53-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-53.59~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-oracle - 5.15.0-1022.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1027-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1027.31\nNo subscription required",
