		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm,kmsan: fix infinite recursion due to RCU critical section AlexanderPotapenko writes in [1]: \"For every memory access in the code instrumentedby KMSAN we call kmsan_get_metadata() to obtain the metadata for the memorybeing accessed. For virtual memory the metadata pointers are stored in thecorresponding `struct page`, therefore we need to call virt_to_page() toget them. According to the comment in arch/x86/include/asm/page.h,virt_to_page(kaddr) returns a valid pointer iff virt_addr_valid(kaddr) istrue, so KMSAN needs to call virt_addr_valid() as well. To avoid recursion,kmsan_get_metadata() must not call instrumented code, therefore./arch/x86/include/asm/kmsan.h forks parts of arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c tocheck whether a virtual address is valid or not. But the introduction ofrcu_read_lock() to pfn_valid() added instrumented RCU API calls tovirt_to_page_or_null(), which is called by kmsan_get_metadata(), so thereis an infinite recursion now. I do not think it is correct to stop thatrecursion by doing kmsan_enter_runtime()/kmsan_exit_runtime() inkmsan_get_metadata(): that would prevent instrumented functions called fromwithin the runtime from tracking the shadow values, which might introducefalse positives.\" Fix the issue by switching pfn_valid() to the _sched()variant of rcu_read_lock/unlock(), which does not require calling into RCU.Given the critical section in pfn_valid() is very small, this is areasonable trade-off (with preemptible RCU). KMSAN further needs to becareful to suppress calls into the scheduler, which would be another sourceof recursion. This can be done by wrapping the call to pfn_valid() intopreempt_disable/enable_no_resched(). The downside is that this sacrificesbreaking scheduling guarantees; however, a kernel compiled with KMSAN hasalready given up any performance guarantees due to being heavilyinstrumented. Note, KMSAN code already disables tracing via Makefile, andsince mmzone.h is included, it is not necessary to use the notrace variant,which is generally preferred in all other cases.",
