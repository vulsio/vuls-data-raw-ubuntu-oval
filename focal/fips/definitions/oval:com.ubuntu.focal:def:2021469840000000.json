		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: kyber:fix out of bounds access when preempted __blk_mq_sched_bio_merge() gets thectx and hctx for the current CPU and passes the hctx to ->bio_merge().kyber_bio_merge() then gets the ctx for the current CPU again and uses thatto get the corresponding Kyber context in the passed hctx. However, thethread may be preempted between the two calls to blk_mq_get_ctx(), and thectx returned the second time may no longer correspond to the passed hctx.This \"works\" accidentally most of the time, but it can cause us to readgarbage if the second ctx came from an hctx with more ctx's than the firstone (i.e., if ctx->index_hw[hctx->type] > hctx->nr_ctx). This manifested asthis UBSAN array index out of bounds error reported by Jakub: UBSAN:array-index-out-of-bounds in ../kernel/locking/qspinlock.c:130:9 index13106 is out of range for type 'long unsigned int [128]' Call Trace:dump_stack+0xa4/0xe5 ubsan_epilogue+0x5/0x40__ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds.cold.13+0x2a/0x34queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x476/0x480 do_raw_spin_lock+0x1c2/0x1d0kyber_bio_merge+0x112/0x180 blk_mq_submit_bio+0x1f5/0x1100submit_bio_noacct+0x7b0/0x870 submit_bio+0xc2/0x3a0btrfs_map_bio+0x4f0/0x9d0 btrfs_submit_data_bio+0x24e/0x310submit_one_bio+0x7f/0xb0 submit_extent_page+0xc4/0x440__extent_writepage_io+0x2b8/0x5e0 __extent_writepage+0x28d/0x6e0extent_write_cache_pages+0x4d7/0x7a0 extent_writepages+0xa2/0x110do_writepages+0x8f/0x180 __writeback_single_inode+0x99/0x7f0writeback_sb_inodes+0x34e/0x790 __writeback_inodes_wb+0x9e/0x120wb_writeback+0x4d2/0x660 wb_workfn+0x64d/0xa10 process_one_work+0x53a/0xa80worker_thread+0x69/0x5b0 kthread+0x20b/0x240 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 OnlyKyber uses the hctx, so fix it by passing the request_queue to->bio_merge() instead. BFQ and mq-deadline just use that, and Kyber can mapthe queues itself to avoid the mismatch.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46984` to fix the vulnerability.
