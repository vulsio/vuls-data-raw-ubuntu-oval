		"title": "CVE-2022-48629 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:crypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filledThe generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destinationbuffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()can run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled withrandomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed sinceqcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue canbe reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:    kcapi-rng -b 9000000 > OUTFILEThe generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain allzeros, and this is caused by the code where the test'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.Let's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returnswith a full buffer if the function returns success. Let's also haveqcom_rng_generate() return the correct value.Here's some statistics from the ent project(https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about thequality of the generated numbers:    $ ent -c qcom-random-before    Value Char Occurrences Fraction      0           606748   0.067416      1            33104   0.003678      2            33001   0.003667    ...    253   ?        32883   0.003654    254   ?        33035   0.003671    255   ?        33239   0.003693    Total:       9000000   1.000000    Entropy = 7.811590 bits per byte.    Optimum compression would reduce the size    of this 9000000 byte file by 2 percent.    Chi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 9329962.81, and    randomly would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the    times.    Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 119.3731 (127.5 = random).    Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.197293333 (error 1.77 percent).    Serial correlation coefficient is 0.159130 (totally uncorrelated =    0.0).Without this patch, the results of the chi-square test is 0.01%, andthe numbers are certainly not random according to ent's project page.The results improve with this patch:    $ ent -c qcom-random-after    Value Char Occurrences Fraction      0            35432   0.003937      1            35127   0.003903      2            35424   0.003936    ...    253   ?        35201   0.003911    254   ?        34835   0.003871    255   ?        35368   0.003930    Total:       9000000   1.000000    Entropy = 7.999979 bits per byte.    Optimum compression would reduce the size    of this 9000000 byte file by 0 percent.    Chi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 258.77, and randomly    would exceed this value 42.24 percent of the times.    Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5006 (127.5 = random).    Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141277333 (error 0.01 percent).    Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000468 (totally uncorrelated =    0.0).This change was tested on a Nexus 5 phone (msm8974 SoC).",
