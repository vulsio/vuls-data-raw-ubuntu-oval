		"Title": "CVE-2021-22884 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNSrebinding attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”. When “localhost6”is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that isresolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim'sDNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can bebypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the“localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described inCVE-2018-7160.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-22884` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnode64 - 10.19.0~dfsg-3ubuntu1.2\nnodejs - 10.19.0~dfsg-3ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
