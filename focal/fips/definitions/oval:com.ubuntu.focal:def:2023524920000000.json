In case of failure,chan->local is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan->local is nullified.When dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of managed API orintentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are unconditionallyunregistered, leading to this NULL pointer:[    1.318693] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtualaddress 00000000000000d0[...][    1.484499] Call trace:[    1.486930]  device_del+0x40/0x394[    1.490314]  device_unregister+0x20/0x7c[    1.494220]  __dma_async_device_channel_unregister+0x68/0xc0Look at dma_async_device_register() function error path, channel deviceunregistration is done only if chan->local is not NULL.Then add the same condition at the beginning of__dma_async_device_channel_unregister() function, to avoid NULL pointerissue whatever the API used to reach this function.",
