		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mm: Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit typeOn 64-bit platforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the inputvalue is 64 bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't getlost when shifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physicaladdress to provide a virtual address for.One such example is in pvalidate_pages() (used by SEV-SNP guests), wherethe GFN in the struct used for page-state change requests is a 40-bitbit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN field directly intopfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealing with addressesabove the 1TB range due to the above.Fix this issue with SEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases thatmight cause issues in current/future code, by using an inline function,instead of a macro, so that the input is implicitly cast to theexpected 64-bit input type prior to performing the shift operation.While it might be argued that the issue is on the caller side, otherarchs/macros have taken similar approaches to deal with instances likethis, such as ARM explicitly casting the input to phys_addr_t:  e48866647b48 (\"ARM: 8396/1: use phys_addr_t in pfn_to_kaddr()\")A C inline function is even better though.[ mingo: Refined the changelog some more & added __always_inline. ]",
