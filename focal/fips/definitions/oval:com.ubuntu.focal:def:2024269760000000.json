		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: Always flush async #PF workqueue when vCPU is being destroyedAlways flush the per-vCPU async #PF workqueue when a vCPU is clearing itscompletion queue, e.g. when a VM and all its vCPUs is being destroyed.KVM must ensure that none of its workqueue callbacks is running when thelast reference to the KVM _module_ is put.  Gifting a reference to theassociated VM prevents the workqueue callback from dereferencing freedvCPU/VM memory, but does not prevent the KVM module from being unloadedbefore the callback completes.Drop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm() fromasync_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueue willresult in deadlock.  async_pf_execute() can't return until kvm_put_kvm()finishes, and kvm_put_kvm() can't return until async_pf_execute() finishes: WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 251 at virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1435kvm_put_kvm+0x2d/0x320 [kvm] Modules linked in: vhost_net vhost vhost_iotlb tap kvm_intel kvm irqbypass CPU: 8 PID: 251 Comm: kworker/8:1 Tainted: G        W6.6.0-rc1-e7af8d17224a-x86/gmem-vm #119 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015 Workqueue: events async_pf_execute [kvm] RIP: 0010:kvm_put_kvm+0x2d/0x320 [kvm] Call Trace:  <TASK>  async_pf_execute+0x198/0x260 [kvm]  process_one_work+0x145/0x2d0  worker_thread+0x27e/0x3a0  kthread+0xba/0xe0  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20  </TASK> ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]--- INFO: task kworker/8:1:251 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

And that in turn fixes the moduleunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU referenceuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts thelast reference to the KVM module.Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item offthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as thework will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waitingon the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for thework to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a verysmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes anew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so theremaining work is really just:        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);        mmput(mm);and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU isstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with \"wakeup all\"work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in aworkqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).Note, commit 5f6de5cbebee (\"KVM: Prevent module exit until al---truncated---",
