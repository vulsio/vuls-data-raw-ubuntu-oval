		"description": "Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checkingexcessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impactsummary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generatean X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that useDH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() tocheck an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained froman untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check()performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key()doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable forexcessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key()performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for anexcessively large Q. An application that calls DH_generate_key() orDH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from anuntrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number ofother OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those otherfunctions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by thisare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), andEVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command lineapplication when using the \"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSLgenpkey command line application. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is notaffected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are notaffected by this issue.",
