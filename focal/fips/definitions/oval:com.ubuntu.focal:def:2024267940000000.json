		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix race between ordered extent completion and fiemapFor fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for thewhole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in ascenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range ofthe same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice butit may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).However by not locking the target extent range for the whole duration ofthe fiemap call we can race with an ordered extent. This happens likethis:1) The fiemap task finishes processing a file extent item that covers   the file range [512K, 1M[, and that file extent item is the last item   in the leaf currently being processed;2) And ordered extent for the file range [768K, 2M[, in COW mode,   completes (btrfs_finish_one_ordered()) and the file extent item   covering the range [512K, 1M[ is trimmed to cover the range   [512K, 768K[ and then a new file extent item for the range [768K, 2M[   is inserted in the inode's subvolume tree;3) The fiemap task calls fiemap_next_leaf_item(), which then calls   btrfs_next_leaf() to find the next leaf / item. This finds that the   the next key following the one we previously processed (its type is   BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and its offset is 512K), is the key corresponding   to the new file extent item inserted by the ordered extent, which has   a type of BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY and an offset of 768K;4) Later the fiemap code ends up at emit_fiemap_extent() and triggers   the warning:      if (cache->offset + cache->len > offset) {               WARN_ON(1);               return -EINVAL;      }   Since we get 1M > 768K, because the previously emitted entry for the   old extent covering the file range [512K, 1M[ ends at an offset that   is greater than the new extent's start offset (768K). This makes fiemap   fail with -EINVAL besides triggering the warning that produces a stack   trace like the following:     [1621.677651] ------------[ cut here ]------------     [1621.677656] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 204366 at fs/btrfs/extent_io.c:2492emit_fiemap_extent+0x84/0x90 [btrfs]     [1621.677899] Modules linked in: btrfs blake2b_generic (...)
