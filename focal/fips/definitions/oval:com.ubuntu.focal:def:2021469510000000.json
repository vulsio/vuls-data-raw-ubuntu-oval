		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tpm: efi: Use local variable for calculating final log sizeWhen tpm_read_log_efi is called multiple times, which happens whenone loads and unloads a TPM2 driver multiple times, then the globalvariable efi_tpm_final_log_size will at some point become a negativenumber due to the subtraction of final_events_preboot_size occurringeach time. Use a local variable to avoid this integer underflow.The following issue is now resolved:Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 +ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: Workqueue: tpm-vtpm vtpm_proxy_work[tpm_vtpm_proxy]Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: RIP: 0010:__memcpy+0x12/0x20Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: Code: 00 b8 01 00 00 00 85 d2 74 0a c7 0544 7b ef 00 0f 00 00 00 c3 cc cc cc 66 66 90 66 90 48 89 f8 48 89 d1 48 c1e9 03 83 e2 07 <f3> 48 a5 89 d1 f3 a4 c3 66 0f 1f 44 00 00 48 89 f8 48 89d1 f3 a4Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: RSP: 0018:ffff9ac4c0fcfde0 EFLAGS: 00010206Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: RAX: ffff88f878cefed5 RBX: ffff88f878ce9000RCX: 1ffffffffffffe0fMar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: RDX: 0000000000000003 RSI: ffff9ac4c003bff9RDI: ffff88f878cf0e4dMar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: RBP: ffff9ac4c003b000 R08: 0000000000001000R09: 000000007e9d6073Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: R10: ffff9ac4c003b000 R11: ffff88f879ad3500R12: 0000000000000ed5Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: R13: ffff88f878ce9760 R14: 0000000000000002R15: ffff88f77de7f018Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: FS:  0000000000000000(0000)GS:ffff88f87bd00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0:0000000080050033Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: CR2: ffff9ac4c003c000 CR3: 00000001785a6004CR4: 0000000000060ee0Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: Call Trace:Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: tpm_read_log_efi+0x152/0x1a7Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: tpm_bios_log_setup+0xc8/0x1c0Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: tpm_chip_register+0x8f/0x260Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: vtpm_proxy_work+0x16/0x60 [tpm_vtpm_proxy]Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: process_one_work+0x1b4/0x370Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: worker_thread+0x53/0x3e0Mar  8 15:35:12 hibinst kernel: ? process_one_work+0x370/0x370",
