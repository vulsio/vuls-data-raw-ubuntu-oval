		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Fix a race on command flush flowFix a refcount use after free warning due to a race on command entry.Such race occurs when one of the commands releases its last refcount andfrees its index and entry while another process running command flushflow takes refcount to this command entry. The process which handlescommands flush may see this command as needed to be flushed if the otherprocess released its refcount but didn't release the index yet. Fix itby adding the needed spin lock.It fixes the following warning trace:refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 540311 at lib/refcount.c:25refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0...RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0...Call Trace: <TASK> mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions+0x293/0x340 [mlx5_core] mlx5_cmd_flush+0x3a/0xf0 [mlx5_core] enter_error_state+0x44/0x80 [mlx5_core] mlx5_fw_fatal_reporter_err_work+0x37/0xe0 [mlx5_core] process_one_work+0x1be/0x390 worker_thread+0x4d/0x3d0 ? rescuer_thread+0x350/0x350 kthread+0x141/0x160 ? set_kthread_struct+0x40/0x40 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 </TASK>",
