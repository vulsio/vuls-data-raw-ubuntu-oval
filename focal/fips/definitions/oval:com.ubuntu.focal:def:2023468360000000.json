		"description": "The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (SpeculativeReturn Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe. It was believed that themitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled. However, theoriginal XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left interruptsenabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one conditionally onwhether XPTI was active. As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPUvendors, the mitigations are not active together by default. Therefore,there is a race condition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSOprotections and launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.",
