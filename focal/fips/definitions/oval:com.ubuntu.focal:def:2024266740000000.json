		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/lib: Revert to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user() fixupsDuring memory error injection test on kernels >= v6.4, the kernel panicslike below. However, this issue couldn't be reproduced on kernels <= v6.3.  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 296: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 1:bd80000000100134  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffff821b9776>{__get_user_nocheck_4+0x6/0x20}  mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC 411a93533ed ADDR 346a8730040 MISC 86  mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:a06d0 TIME 1706000767 SOCKET 1 APIC211 microcode 80001490  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area ofkernel  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine checkThe MCA code can recover from an in-kernel #MC if the fixup type isEX_TYPE_UACCESS, explicitly indicating that the kernel is attempting toaccess userspace memory. However, if the fixup type is EX_TYPE_DEFAULTthe only thing that is raised for an in-kernel #MC is a panic.ex_handler_uaccess() would warn if users gave a non-canonical addresses(with bit 63 clear) to {get, put}_user(), which was unexpected.Therefore, commit  b19b74bc99b1 (\"x86/mm: Rework address range check in get_user() andput_user()\")replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE() for {get, put}_user()fixups. However, the new fixup type EX_TYPE_DEFAULT results in a panic.Commit  6014bc27561f (\"x86-64: make access_ok() independent of LAM\")added the check gp_fault_address_ok() right before the WARN_ONCE() inex_handler_uaccess() to not warn about non-canonical user addresses dueto LAM.With that in place, revert back to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user()exception fixups in order to be able to handle in-kernel MCEs correctlyagain.
