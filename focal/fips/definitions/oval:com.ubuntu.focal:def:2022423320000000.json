		"Description": "x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where hostassisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging(HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Shadowmode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page tables as well asauxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests, Xen additionallyruns them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by thelog-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order tokeep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations whichmay require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front thatenough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately,while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code pathrequiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by thelog-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result,just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, whileother code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remainallocated.",
