		"description": "Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0before 9.3.0.One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java systemproperties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide systemproperties that had \"password\" contained in the name.There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as \"basicauth\" and\"aws.secretKey\" do not contain \"password\", thus their values were publishedvia the \"/admin/info/properties\" endpoint.This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen ofthe Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the \"config-read\"permission.Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerablethrough logged-in users that have the \"config-read\" permission.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixesthe issue.A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints,\"-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps\".By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including\"-Dbasicauth\"), as well as any property with a name containing \"secret\" or\"password\".Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property tofix the issue:Â  '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'",
