If onlya sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then itwas possible for a specially constructed request to expose applicationfunctionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clientsaccessing the application via the reverse proxy. It was also possible insome configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass theaccess controls configured in httpd.
