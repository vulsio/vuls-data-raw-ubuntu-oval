		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c:core: Run atomic i2c xfer when !preemptible Since bae1d3a05a8b, i2ctransfers are non-atomic if preemption is disabled. However, non-atomic i2ctransfers require preemption (e.g. in wait_for_completion() while waitingfor the DMA). panic() calls preempt_disable_notrace() before callingemergency_restart(). Therefore, if an i2c device is used for the restart,the xfer should be atomic. This avoids warnings like: [ 12.667612] WARNING:CPU: 1 PID: 1 at kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:318rcu_note_context_switch+0x33c/0x6b0 [ 12.676926] Voluntary context switchwithin RCU read-side critical section! ...
