		"title": "CVE-2024-42256 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cifs: Fix server re-repick on subrequest retryWhen a subrequest is marked for needing retry, netfs will callcifs_prepare_write() which will make cifs repick the server for the opbefore renegotiating credits; it then calls cifs_issue_write() whichinvokes smb2_async_writev() - which re-repicks the server.If a different server is then selected, this causes the increment ofserver->in_flight to happen against one record and the decrement to happenagainst another, leading to misaccounting.Fix this by just removing the repick code in smb2_async_writev().  As thisis only called from netfslib-driven code, cifs_prepare_write() shouldalways have been called first, and so server should never be NULL and thepreparatory step is repeated in the event that we do a retry.The problem manifests as a warning looking something like: WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 72896 at fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c:97smb2_add_credits+0x3f0/0x9e0 [cifs] ... RIP: 0010:smb2_add_credits+0x3f0/0x9e0 [cifs] ...  smb2_writev_callback+0x334/0x560 [cifs]  cifs_demultiplex_thread+0x77a/0x11b0 [cifs]  kthread+0x187/0x1d0  ret_from_fork+0x34/0x60  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30Which may be triggered by a number of different xfstests running against anAzure server in multichannel mode.  generic/249 seems the most repeatable,but generic/215, generic/249 and generic/308 may also show it.",
