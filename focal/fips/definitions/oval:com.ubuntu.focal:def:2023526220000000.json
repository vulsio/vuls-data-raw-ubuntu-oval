Currently, the minimum value ofMAX_ORDER is 8, the minimum value of PAGE_SIZE is 4096, the correspondingmaximum number of groups that can be allocated is: (PAGE_SIZE << MAX_ORDER) / sizeof(struct ext4_new_group_data) Ëœ 21845And the value that is down-aligned to the power of 2 is 16384. Therefore,this value is defined as MAX_RESIZE_BG, and the number of groups addedeach time does not exceed this value during resizing, and is added multipletimes to complete the online resizing. The difference is that the metadatain a flex_bg may be more dispersed.",
