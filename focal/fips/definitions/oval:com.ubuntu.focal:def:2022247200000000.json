		"description": "image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips andImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply`method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that arecoming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shellcommands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, soActive Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed inversion 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who processbased on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing onlya constrained set of operations.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24720` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-image-processing - 1.10.3-1ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
