		"Title": "CVE-2022-4382 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw caused by a race among the superblock operations in the gadgetfs Linux driver was found. It could be triggered by yanking out a device that is running the gadgetfs side. Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4382` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-146.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-lowlatency - 5.4.0-146.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-aws - 5.4.0-1099.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-azure - 5.4.0-1105.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1105.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-gcp - 5.4.0-1102.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-gke - 5.4.0-1096.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gke - 5.15.0-1029.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gkeop - 5.4.0-1066.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-ibm - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1088-kvm - 5.4.0-1088.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-oracle - 5.4.0-1098.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1082-raspi - 5.4.0-1082.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-146.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-lowlatency - 5.4.0-146.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-aws - 5.4.0-1099.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-azure - 5.4.0-1105.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1105.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1060-bluefield - 5.4.0-1060.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-gcp - 5.4.0-1102.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-gke - 5.4.0-1096.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gke - 5.15.0-1029.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gkeop - 5.4.0-1066.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-ibm - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1088-kvm - 5.4.0-1088.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-oracle - 5.4.0-1098.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1023-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1023.27\nNo subscription required",
