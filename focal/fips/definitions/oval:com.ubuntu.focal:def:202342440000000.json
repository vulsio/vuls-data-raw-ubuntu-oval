		"Title": "CVE-2023-4244 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Due to a race condition between nf_tables netlink control plane transaction and nft_set element garbage collection, it is possible to underflow the reference counter causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 3e91b0ebd994635df2346353322ac51ce84ce6d8. Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4244` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-aws - 5.15.0-1048.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-gcp - 5.15.0-1045.53~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gkeop - 5.15.0-1031.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic-64k - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-ibm - 5.15.0-1041.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-oracle - 5.15.0-1046.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-aws - 5.15.0-1048.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-gcp - 5.15.0-1045.53~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gkeop - 5.15.0-1031.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic-64k - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-ibm - 5.15.0-1041.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-oracle - 5.15.0-1046.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
