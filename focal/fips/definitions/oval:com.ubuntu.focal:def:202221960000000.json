		"description": "A regression exists in the Linux Kernel within KVM: nVMX that allowed forspeculative execution attacks. L2 can carry out Spectre v2 attacks on L1due to L1 thinking it doesn't need retpolines or IBPB after running L2 dueto KVM (L0) advertising eIBRS support to L1. An attacker at L2 with codeexecution can execute code on an indirect branch on the host machine.
