    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability exists in numpy.sort in NumPy &lt and 1.19 in the PyArray_DescrNew function due to missing return-value validation, which allows attackers to conduct DoS attacks by repetitively creating sort arrays. NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41495` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-numpy - 1:1.17.4-5ubuntu3.1\nNo subscription required",
