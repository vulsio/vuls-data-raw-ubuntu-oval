		"description": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives andrecipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into`would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, butprovide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as`bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python andresulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. Thisissue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced incryptography 1.8.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-23931` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-cryptography - 2.8-3ubuntu0.2\npython3-cryptography - 2.8-3ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
