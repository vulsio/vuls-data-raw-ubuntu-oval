		"Title": "CVE-2022-0516 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in kvm_s390_guest_sida_op in the arch/s390/kvm/kvm-s390.c function in KVM for s390 in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to obtain unauthorized memory write access. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.17-rc4. It was discovered that the KVM implementation for s390 systems in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent memory operations on PVM guests that were in non-protected mode. A local attacker could use this to obtain unauthorized memory write access.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0516` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic -
