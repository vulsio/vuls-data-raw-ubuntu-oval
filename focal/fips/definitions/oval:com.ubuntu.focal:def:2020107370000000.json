		"title": "CVE-2020-10737 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "A race condition was found in the mkhomedir tool shipped with the oddjobpackage in versions before 0.34.5 and 0.34.6 wherein, during the homecreation, mkhomedir copies the /etc/skel directory into the newly createdhome and changes its ownership to the home's user without properly checkingthe homedir path. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue bycreating a symlink point to a target folder, which then has its ownershiptransferred to the new home directory's unprivileged user.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10737` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\noddjob - 0.34.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\noddjob-mkhomedir - 0.34.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
