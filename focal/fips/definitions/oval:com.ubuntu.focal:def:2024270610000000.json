		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:sun8i-ce - Fix use after free in unprepare sun8i_ce_cipher_unprepare shouldbe called before crypto_finalize_skcipher_request, because client callbacksmay immediately free memory, that isn't needed anymore. But it will be usedby unprepare after free. Before removing prepare/unprepare callbacks it washandled by crypto engine in crypto_finalize_request. Usually that resultsin a pointer dereference problem during a in crypto selftest.
