		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:crypto: sun8i-ce - Fix use after free in unpreparesun8i_ce_cipher_unprepare should be called beforecrypto_finalize_skcipher_request, because client callbacks mayimmediately free memory, that isn't needed anymore. But it will beused by unprepare after free. Before removing prepare/unpreparecallbacks it was handled by crypto engine in crypto_finalize_request.Usually that results in a pointer dereference problem during a incrypto selftest. Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at                                      virtual address 0000000000000030 Mem abort info:   ESR = 0x0000000096000004   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits   SET = 0, FnV = 0   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault Data abort info:   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004, ISS2 = 0x00000000   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0 user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=000000004716d000 [0000000000000030] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] SMPThis problem is detected by KASAN as well. ================================================================== BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in sun8i_ce_cipher_do_one+0x6e8/0xf80[sun8i_ce] Read of size 8 at addr ffff00000dcdc040 by task 1c15000.crypto-/373 Hardware name: Pine64 PinePhone (1.2) (DT) Call trace:  dump_backtrace+0x9c/0x128  show_stack+0x20/0x38  dump_stack_lvl+0x48/0x60  print_report+0xf8/0x5d8  kasan_report+0x90/0xd0  __asan_load8+0x9c/0xc0  sun8i_ce_cipher_do_one+0x6e8/0xf80 [sun8i_ce]  crypto_pump_work+0x354/0x620 [crypto_engine]  kthread_worker_fn+0x244/0x498  kthread+0x168/0x178  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20 Allocated by task 379:  kasan_save_stack+0x3c/0x68  kasan_set_track+0x2c/0x40  kasan_save_alloc_info+0x24/0x38  __kasan_kmalloc+0xd4/0xd8  __kmalloc+0x74/0x1d0  alg_test_skcipher+0x90/0x1f0  alg_test+0x24c/0x830  cryptomgr_test+0x38/0x60  kthread+0x168/0x178  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20 Freed by task 379:  kasan_save_stack+0x3c/0x68  kasan_set_track+0x2c/0x40  kasan_save_free_info+0x38/0x60  __kasan_slab_free+0x100/0x170  slab_free_freelist_hook+0xd4/0x1e8  __kmem_cache_free+0x15c/0x290  kfree+0x74/0x100  kfree_sensitive+0x80/0xb0  alg_test_skcipher+0x12c/0x1f0  alg_test+0x24c/0x830  cryptomgr_test+0x38/0x60  kthread+0x168/0x178  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20 The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff00000dcdc000  which belongs to the cache kmalloc-256 of size 256 The buggy address is located 64 bytes inside of  freed 256-byte region [ffff00000dcdc000, ffff00000dcdc100)",
