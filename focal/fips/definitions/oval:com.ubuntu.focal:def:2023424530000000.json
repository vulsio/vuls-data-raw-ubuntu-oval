		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by theMatrix.org Foundation. Users were able to forge read receipts for any event(if they knew the room ID and event ID). Note that the users were not ableto view the events, but simply mark it as read. This could be confusing asclients will show the event as read by the user, even if they are not inthe room. This issue has been patched in version 1.93.0. Users are advisedto upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
