		"Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCIspecification. In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes`/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when runc is executedinside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify thecgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run--cgroupns=host`, with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc isexecuted outside the user namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro`(e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare). A containermay gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy`/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgrouphierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace(`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the defaultbehavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add`/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25809` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrunc - 1.1.4-0ubuntu1~20.04.3\nNo subscription required",
