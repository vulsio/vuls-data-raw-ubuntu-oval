    "Title": "CVE-2023-35823 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in saa7134_finidev in drivers/media/pci/saa7134/saa7134-core.c. It was discovered that the video4linux driver for Philips based TV cards in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-35823` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-aws - 5.15.0-1041.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1043.50~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gkeop - 5.4.0-1076.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-kvm - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1093-raspi - 5.4.0-1093.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-aws - 5.15.0-1041.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1043.50~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gcp - 5.15.0-1039.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1039-gke - 5.15.0-1039.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gkeop - 5.4.0-1076.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gkeop - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-5.15.0-79-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-generic-64k - 5.15.0-79.86~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-ibm - 5.15.0-1035.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1037.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-kvm - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-79-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-79.88~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-oracle - 5.15.0-1040.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1029-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1029.33\nNo subscription required",
