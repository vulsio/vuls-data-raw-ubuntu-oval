		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:udp: Set SOCK_RCU_FREE earlier in udp_lib_get_port().syzkaller triggered the warning [0] in udp_v4_early_demux().In udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), we do not touch the refcountof the looked-up sk and use sock_pfree() as skb->destructor, so we checkSOCK_RCU_FREE to ensure that the sk is safe to access during the RCU graceperiod.Currently, SOCK_RCU_FREE is flagged for a bound socket after being putinto the hash table.  Moreover, the SOCK_RCU_FREE check is done too earlyin udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), so there could be a small racewindow:  CPU1                                 CPU2  ----                                 ----  udp_v4_early_demux()                 udp_lib_get_port()  |                                    |- hlist_add_head_rcu()  |- sk = __udp4_lib_demux_lookup()    |  |- DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(sk_is_refcounted(sk));                                       `- sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_RCU_FREE)We had the same bug in TCP and fixed it in commit 871019b22d1b (\"net:set SOCK_RCU_FREE before inserting socket into hashtable\").Let's apply the same fix for UDP.[0]:WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11198 at net/ipv4/udp.c:2599udp_v4_early_demux+0x481/0xb70 net/ipv4/udp.c:2599Modules linked in:CPU: 0 PID: 11198 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 6.9.0-g93bda33046e7 #13Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOSrel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:udp_v4_early_demux+0x481/0xb70 net/ipv4/udp.c:2599Code: c5 7a 15 fe bb 01 00 00 00 44 89 e9 31 ff d3 e3 81 e3 bf ef ff ff 89de e8 2c 74 15 fe 85 db 0f 85 02 06 00 00 e8 9f 7a 15 fe <0f> 0b e8 98 7a15 fe 49 8d 7e 60 e8 4f 39 2f fe 49 c7 46 60 20 52RSP: 0018:ffffc9000ce3fa58 EFLAGS: 00010293RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: ffffffff8318c92cRDX: ffff888036ccde00 RSI: ffffffff8318c2f1 RDI: 0000000000000001RBP: ffff88805a2dd6e0 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0001ffffffffffff R12: ffff88805a2dd680R13: 0000000000000007 R14: ffff88800923f900 R15: ffff88805456004eFS:  00007fc449127640(0000) GS:ffff88807dc00000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007fc449126e38 CR3: 000000003de4b002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000600PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <TASK> ip_rcv_finish_core.constprop.0+0xbdd/0xd20 net/ipv4/ip_input.c:349 ip_rcv_finish+0xda/0x150 net/ipv4/ip_input.c:447 NF_HOOK include/linux/netfilter.h:314 [inline] NF_HOOK include/linux/netfilter.h:308 [inline] ip_rcv+0x16c/0x180 net/ipv4/ip_input.c:569 __netif_receive_skb_one_core+0xb3/0xe0 net/core/dev.c:5624 __netif_receive_skb+0x21/0xd0 net/core/dev.c:5738 netif_receive_skb_internal net/core/dev.c:5824 [inline] netif_receive_skb+0x271/0x300 net/core/dev.c:5884 tun_rx_batched drivers/net/tun.c:1549 [inline] tun_get_user+0x24db/0x2c50 drivers/net/tun.c:2002 tun_chr_write_iter+0x107/0x1a0 drivers/net/tun.c:2048 new_sync_write fs/read_write.c:497 [inline] vfs_write+0x76f/0x8d0 fs/read_write.c:590 ksys_write+0xbf/0x190 fs/read_write.c:643 __do_sys_write fs/read_write.c:655 [inline] __se_sys_write fs/read_write.c:652 [inline] __x64_sys_write+0x41/0x50 fs/read_write.c:652 x64_sys_call+0xe66/0x1990 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:2 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x4b/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53RIP: 0033:0x7fc44a68bc1fCode: 89 54 24 18 48 89 74 24 10 89 7c 24 08 e8 e9 cf f5 ff 48 8b 54 24 1848 8b 74 24 10 41 89 c0 8b 7c 24 08 b8 01 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0 ffff 77 31 44 89 c7 48 89 44 24 08 e8 3c d0 f5 ff 48RSP: 002b:00007fc449126c90 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00000000004bc050 RCX: 00007fc44a68bc1fR---truncated---",
