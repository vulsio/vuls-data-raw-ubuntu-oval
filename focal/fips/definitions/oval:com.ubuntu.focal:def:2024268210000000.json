		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs:relax mount_setattr() permission checks When we added mount_setattr() Iadded additional checks compared to the legacy do_reconfigure_mnt() anddo_change_type() helpers used by regular mount(2). If that mount had aparent then verify that the caller and the mount namespace the mount isattached to match and if not make sure that it's an anonymous mount. Thereal rootfs falls into neither category. It is neither an anoymous mountbecause it is obviously attached to the initial mount namespace but it alsoobviously doesn't have a parent mount. So that means legacy mount(2) allowschanging mount properties on the real rootfs but mount_setattr(2) blocksthis. I never thought much about this but of course someone on this planetof earth changes properties on the real rootfs as can be seen in [1]. Sinceutil-linux finally switched to the new mount api in 2.39 not so long ago italso relies on mount_setattr() and that surfaced this issue when Fedora 39finally switched to it. Fix this.",
