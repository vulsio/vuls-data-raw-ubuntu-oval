    "Title": "CVE-2022-1789 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "With shadow paging enabled, the INVPCID instruction results in a call to kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva. If INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0, the invlpg callback is not set and the result is a NULL pointer dereference. Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1789` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-aws - 5.15.0-1015.19~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-azure - 5.15.0-1014.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1014.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-gcp - 5.15.0-1013.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-kvm - 5.4.0-1071.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1044-oem - 5.14.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-oracle - 5.15.0-1013.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1066-raspi - 5.4.0-1066.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-aws - 5.15.0-1015.19~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-azure - 5.15.0-1014.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1014.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-gcp - 5.15.0-1013.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-kvm - 5.4.0-1071.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1044-oem - 5.14.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1013-oracle - 5.15.0-1013.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
