		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring: check for non-NULL file pointer in io_file_can_poll()In earlier kernels, it was possible to trigger a NULL pointerdereference off the forced async preparation path, if no file hadbeen assigned. The trace leading to that looks as follows:BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000b0PGD 0 P4D 0Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMPCPU: 67 PID: 1633 Comm: buf-ring-invali Not tainted 6.8.0-rc3+ #1Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS unknown2/2/2022RIP: 0010:io_buffer_select+0xc3/0x210Code: 00 00 48 39 d1 0f 82 ae 00 00 00 48 81 4b 48 00 00 01 00 48 89 73 700f b7 50 0c 66 89 53 42 85 ed 0f 85 d2 00 00 00 48 8b 13 <48> 8b 92 b0 0000 00 48 83 7a 40 00 0f 84 21 01 00 00 4c 8b 20 5bRSP: 0018:ffffb7bec38c7d88 EFLAGS: 00010246RAX: ffff97af2be61000 RBX: ffff97af234f1700 RCX: 0000000000000040RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffff97aecfb04820 RDI: ffff97af234f1700RBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000200030 R09: 0000000000000020R10: ffffb7bec38c7dc8 R11: 000000000000c000 R12: ffffb7bec38c7db8R13: ffff97aecfb05800 R14: ffff97aecfb05800 R15: ffff97af2be5e000FS:  00007f852f74b740(0000) GS:ffff97b1eeec0000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00000000000000b0 CR3: 000000016deab005 CR4: 0000000000370ef0Call Trace: <TASK> ? __die+0x1f/0x60 ? page_fault_oops+0x14d/0x420 ? do_user_addr_fault+0x61/0x6a0 ? exc_page_fault+0x6c/0x150 ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30 ? io_buffer_select+0xc3/0x210 __io_import_iovec+0xb5/0x120 io_readv_prep_async+0x36/0x70 io_queue_sqe_fallback+0x20/0x260 io_submit_sqes+0x314/0x630 __do_sys_io_uring_enter+0x339/0xbc0 ? __do_sys_io_uring_register+0x11b/0xc50 ? vm_mmap_pgoff+0xce/0x160 do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x180 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4eRIP: 0033:0x55e0a110a67eCode: ba cc 00 00 00 45 31 c0 44 0f b6 92 d0 00 00 00 31 d2 41 b9 08 00 0000 41 83 e2 01 41 c1 e2 04 41 09 c2 b8 aa 01 00 00 0f 05 <c3> 90 89 30 eba9 0f 1f 40 00 48 8b 42 20 8b 00 a8 06 75 af 85 f6because the request is marked forced ASYNC and has a bad file fd, andhence takes the forced async prep path.Current kernels with the request async prep cleaned up can no longer hitthis issue, but for ease of backporting, let's add this safety check inhere too as it really doesn't hurt.
