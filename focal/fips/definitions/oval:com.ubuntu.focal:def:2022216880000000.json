		"description": "OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymouslyshare files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network.Affected versions of the desktop application were found to be vulnerable todenial of service via an undisclosed vulnerability in the QT image parsing.Roughly 20 bytes lead to 2GB memory consumption and this can be triggeredmultiple times. To be abused, this vulnerability requires rendering in thehistory tab, so some user interaction is required. An adversary withknowledge of the Onion service address in public mode or withauthentication in private mode can perform a Denial of Service attack,which quickly results in out-of-memory for the server. This requires thedesktop application with rendered history, therefore the impact is onlyelevated. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.",
