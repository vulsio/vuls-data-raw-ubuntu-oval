		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i40e:Do not allow untrusted VF to remove administratively set MAC Currently whenPF administratively sets VF's MAC address and the VF is put down (VF triesto delete all MACs) then the MAC is removed from MAC filters and primary VFMAC is zeroed. Do not allow untrusted VF to remove primary MAC when it wasset administratively by PF. Reproducer: 1) Create VF 2) Set VF interface up3) Administratively set the VF's MAC 4) Put VF interface down [root@host~]# echo 1 > /sys/class/net/enp2s0f0/device/sriov_numvfs [root@host ~]# iplink set enp2s0f0v0 up [root@host ~]# ip link set enp2s0f0 vf 0 macfe:6c:b5:da:c7:7d [root@host ~]# ip link show enp2s0f0 23: enp2s0f0:<BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULTgroup default qlen 1000 link/ether 3c:ec:ef:b7:dd:04 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ffvf 0 link/ether fe:6c:b5:da:c7:7d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, spoof checking on,link-state auto, trust off [root@host ~]# ip link set enp2s0f0v0 down[root@host ~]# ip link show enp2s0f0 23: enp2s0f0:<BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULTgroup default qlen 1000 link/ether 3c:ec:ef:b7:dd:04 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ffvf 0 link/ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, spoof checking on,link-state auto, trust off",
