Quotedfrom reply of Shinichiro Kawasaki: \"I confirmed that the trigger commit isdbf8e63f48af as Yi reported. I took a look in the commit, but it looks fineto me. So I thought the cause is not in the commit diff. I found the WARNis printed when the f2fs is set up with multiple devices, and read requestsare mapped to the very first block of the second device in the direct readpath. In this case, f2fs_map_blocks() and f2fs_map_blocks_cached() modifymap->m_pblk as the physical block address from each block device. Itbecomes zero when it is mapped to the first block of the device. However,f2fs_iomap_begin() assumes that map->m_pblk is the physical block addressof the whole f2fs, across the all block devices. It compares map->m_pblkagainst NULL_ADDR == 0, then go into the unexpected branch and sets theinvalid iomap->length. The WARN catches the invalid iomap->length. ThisWARN is printed even for non-zoned block devices, by following steps. -Create two (non-zoned) null_blk devices memory backed with 128MB size each:nullb0 and nullb1. # mkfs.f2fs /dev/nullb0 -c /dev/nullb1 # mount -t f2fs/dev/nullb0 \"${mount_dir}\" # dd if=/dev/zero of=\"${mount_dir}/test.dat\"bs=1M count=192 # dd if=\"${mount_dir}/test.dat\" of=/dev/null bs=1Mcount=192 iflag=direct ...\" So, the root cause of this issue is: whenmulti-devices feature is on, f2fs_map_blocks() may return zero blkaddr innon-primary device, which is a verified valid block address, however,f2fs_iomap_begin() treats it as an invalid block address, and then ittriggers the warning in iomap framework code. Finally, as discussed, wedecide to use a more simple and direct way that checking (map.m_flags &F2FS_MAP_MAPPED) condition instead of (map.m_pblk != NULL_ADDR) to fix thisissue. Thanks a lot for the effort of Yi Zhang and Shinichiro Kawasaki onthis issue.
