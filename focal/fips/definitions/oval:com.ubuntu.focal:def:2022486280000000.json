		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ceph:drop messages from MDS when unmounting When unmounting all the dirtybuffers will be flushed and after the last osd request is finished the lastreference of the i_count will be released. Then it will flush the dirtycap/snap to MDSs, and the unmounting won't wait the possible acks, whichwill ihold the inodes when updating the metadata locally but makes no senseany more, of this. This will make the evict_inodes() to skip these inodes.If encrypt is enabled the kernel generate a warning when removing theencrypt keys when the skipped inodes still hold the keyring: WARNING: CPU:4 PID: 168846 at fs/crypto/keyring.c:242 fscrypt_destroy_keyring+0x7e/0xd0CPU: 4 PID: 168846 Comm: umount Tainted: G S 6.1.0-rc5-ceph-g72ead199864c#1 Hardware name: Supermicro SYS-5018R-WR/X10SRW-F, BIOS 2.0 12/17/2015RIP: 0010:fscrypt_destroy_keyring+0x7e/0xd0 RSP: 0018:ffffc9000b277e28EFLAGS: 00010202 RAX: 0000000000000002 RBX: ffff88810d52ac00 RCX:ffff88810b56aa00 RDX: 0000000080000000 RSI: ffffffff822f3a09 RDI:ffff888108f59000 RBP: ffff8881d394fb88 R08: 0000000000000028 R09:0000000000000000 R10: 0000000000000001 R11: 11ff4fe6834fcd91 R12:ffff8881d394fc40 R13: ffff888108f59000 R14: ffff8881d394f800 R15:0000000000000000 FS: 00007fd83f6f1080(0000) GS:ffff88885fd00000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000 CS: 0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007f918d417000 CR3: 000000017f89a005 CR4: 00000000003706e0 DR0:0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000 DR3:0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400 Call Trace:<TASK> generic_shutdown_super+0x47/0x120 kill_anon_super+0x14/0x30ceph_kill_sb+0x36/0x90 [ceph] deactivate_locked_super+0x29/0x60cleanup_mnt+0xb8/0x140 task_work_run+0x67/0xb0exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x23d/0x240 syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x25/0x60do_syscall_64+0x40/0x80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd RIP:0033:0x7fd83dc39e9b Later the kernel will crash when iput() the inodes anddereferencing the \"sb->s_master_keys\", which has been released by thegeneric_shutdown_super().",
