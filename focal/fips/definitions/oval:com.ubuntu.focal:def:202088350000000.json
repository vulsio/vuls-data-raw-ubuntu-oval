    "Title": "CVE-2020-8835 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - high.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29. (issue is aka ZDI-CAN-10780) Manfred Paul discovered that the bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate register bounds for certain operations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or gain administrative privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-8835` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-21-generic - 5.4.0-21.25\nlinux-image-5.4.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-21.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-21-generic - 5.4.0-21.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-21-lowlatency - 5.4.0-21.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-aws - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-azure - 5.4.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-gcp - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1006-kvm - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1007-oem - 5.6.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-oracle - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-21-generic - 5.4.0-21.25\nlinux-image-5.4.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-21.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-21-generic - 5.4.0-21.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-21-lowlatency - 5.4.0-21.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-aws - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-azure - 5.4.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-gcp - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1006-kvm - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1007-oem - 5.6.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-oracle - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required",
