		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: bnx2fc: Flush destroy_work queue before callingbnx2fc_interface_put()The bnx2fc_destroy() functions are removing the interface before callingdestroy_work. This results multiple WARNings from sysfs_remove_group() asthe controller rport device attributes are removed too early.Replace the fcoe_port's destroy_work queue. It's not needed.The problem is easily reproducible with the following steps.Example:  $ dmesg -w &  $ systemctl enable --now fcoe  $ fipvlan -s -c ens2f1  $ fcoeadm -d ens2f1.802  [  583.464488] host2: libfc: Link down on port (7500a1)  [  583.472651] bnx2fc: 7500a1 - rport not created Yet!!
