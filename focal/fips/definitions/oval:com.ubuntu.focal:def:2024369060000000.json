Any instrumented functions on this critical path will leaveportions of the stack shadow poisoned.If CPUs lose context and return to the kernel via a cold path, werestore a prior context saved in __cpu_suspend_enter are forgotten, andwe never remove the poison they placed in the stack shadow area byfunctions calls between this and the actual exit of the kernel.Thus, (depending on stackframe layout) subsequent calls to instrumentedfunctions may hit this stale poison, resulting in (spurious) KASANsplats to the console.To avoid this, clear any stale poison from the idle thread for a CPUprior to bringing a CPU online.From cited commit [2]Extend to check for CONFIG_KASAN_STACK[1] commit 0d97e6d8024c (\"arm64: kasan: clear stale stack poison\")[2] commit d56a9ef84bd0 (\"kasan, arm64: unpoison stack only withCONFIG_KASAN_STACK\")",
