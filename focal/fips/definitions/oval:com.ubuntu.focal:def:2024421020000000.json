		"title": "CVE-2024-42102 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Revert \"mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(),again\"Patch series \"mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling\".Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 formore details).This patch (of 2):This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) castfrom the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bitarchs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - thedefault settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, thediv64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We havediv64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly, if dirtythresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages, then dirty balancing is going toblow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix onepossible overflow is just moot.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42102` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-fips - 5.4.0-1007.8\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1007-fips - 5.4.0-1007.8\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips2\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1021-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1022.22+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1022-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1022.22+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1021-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
