		"description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A use-after-free was foundin Vim < 9.1.0764. When closing a buffer (visible in a window) aBufWinLeave auto command can cause an use-after-free if this auto commandhappens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window. Impact is lowsince the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto commandand run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. Thisissue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised toupgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
