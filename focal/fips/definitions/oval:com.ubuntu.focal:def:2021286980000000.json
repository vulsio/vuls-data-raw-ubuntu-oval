		"description": "long running loops in grant table handling In order to properly monitorresource use, Xen maintains information on the grant mappings a domain maycreate to map grants offered by other domains. In the process of carryingout certain actions, Xen would iterate over all such entries, includingones which aren't in use anymore and some which may have been created butnever used. If the number of entries for a given domain is large enough,this iterating of the entire table may tie up a CPU for too long, starvingother domains or causing issues in the hypervisor itself. Note that adomain may map its own grants, i.e. there is no need for multiple domainsto be involved here. A pair of \"cooperating\" guests may, however, cause theeffects to be more severe.",
