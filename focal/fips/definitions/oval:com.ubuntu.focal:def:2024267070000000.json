		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:hsr: remove WARN_ONCE() in send_hsr_supervision_frame() Syzkaller reported[1] hitting a warning after failing to allocate resources for skb inhsr_init_skb(). Since a WARN_ONCE() call will not help much in this case,it might be prudent to switch to netdev_warn_once(). At the very least itwill suppress syzkaller reports such as [1]. Just in case, usenetdev_warn_once() in send_prp_supervision_frame() for similar reasons.
