		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Prevent deadlock while disabling aRFS When disabling aRFS underthe `priv->state_lock`, any scheduled aRFS works are canceled using the`cancel_work_sync` function, which waits for the work to end if it hasalready started. However, while waiting for the work handler, the handlerwill try to acquire the `state_lock` which is already acquired. The workeracquires the lock to delete the rules if the state is down, which is notthe worker's responsibility since disabling aRFS deletes the rules. Add anaRFS state variable, which indicates whether the aRFS is enabled andprevent adding rules when the aRFS is disabled.
