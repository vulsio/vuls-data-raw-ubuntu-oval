		"description": "curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows amalicious HTTPS proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of TLS 1.3session tickets. When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confusesession tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrivedfrom the remote server and then wrongly \"short-cut\" the host handshake.When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use thewrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent the serverTLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to performunnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide acertificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack towork - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-22890` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl4 - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nNo subscription required",
