		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: esp: fix bad handling of pages from page_poolWhen the skb is reorganized during esp_output (!esp->inline), the pagescoming from the original skb fragments are supposed to be released backto the system through put_page. But if the skb fragment pages areoriginating from a page_pool, calling put_page on them will trigger apage_pool leak which will eventually result in a crash.This leak can be easily observed when using CONFIG_DEBUG_VM and doingipsec + gre (non offloaded) forwarding:  BUG: Bad page state in process ksoftirqd/16  pfn:1451b6  page:00000000de2b8d32 refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000index:0x1451b6000 pfn:0x1451b6  flags: 0x200000000000000(node=0|zone=2)  page_type: 0xffffffff()  raw: 0200000000000000 dead000000000040 ffff88810d23c000 0000000000000000  raw: 00000001451b6000 0000000000000001 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000  page dumped because: page_pool leak  Modules linked in: ip_gre gre mlx5_ib mlx5_core xt_conntrackxt_MASQUERADE nf_conntrack_netlink nfnetlink iptable_nat nf_nat xt_addrtypebr_netfilter rpcrdma rdma_ucm ib_iser libiscsi scsi_transport_iscsi ib_umadrdma_cm ib_ipoib iw_cm ib_cm ib_uverbs ib_core overlay zram zsmalloc fuse[last unloaded: mlx5_core]  CPU: 16 PID: 96 Comm: ksoftirqd/16 Not tainted 6.8.0-rc4+ #22  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOSrel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014  Call Trace:   <TASK>   dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50   bad_page+0x70/0xf0   free_unref_page_prepare+0x27a/0x460   free_unref_page+0x38/0x120   esp_ssg_unref.isra.0+0x15f/0x200   esp_output_tail+0x66d/0x780   esp_xmit+0x2c5/0x360   validate_xmit_xfrm+0x313/0x370   ? validate_xmit_skb+0x1d/0x330   validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x70   sch_direct_xmit+0x23e/0x350   __dev_queue_xmit+0x337/0xba0   ? nf_hook_slow+0x3f/0xd0   ip_finish_output2+0x25e/0x580   iptunnel_xmit+0x19b/0x240   ip_tunnel_xmit+0x5fb/0xb60   ipgre_xmit+0x14d/0x280 [ip_gre]   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xc3/0x1c0   __dev_queue_xmit+0x208/0xba0   ? nf_hook_slow+0x3f/0xd0   ip_finish_output2+0x1ca/0x580   ip_sublist_rcv_finish+0x32/0x40   ip_sublist_rcv+0x1b2/0x1f0   ? ip_rcv_finish_core.constprop.0+0x460/0x460   ip_list_rcv+0x103/0x130   __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x181/0x1e0   netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x1b3/0x2c0   napi_gro_receive+0xc8/0x200   gro_cell_poll+0x52/0x90   __napi_poll+0x25/0x1a0   net_rx_action+0x28e/0x300   __do_softirq+0xc3/0x276   ? sort_range+0x20/0x20   run_ksoftirqd+0x1e/0x30   smpboot_thread_fn+0xa6/0x130   kthread+0xcd/0x100   ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20   ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50   ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20   ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20   </TASK>The suggested fix is to introduce a new wrapper (skb_page_unref) thatcovers page refcounting for page_pool pages as well.",
