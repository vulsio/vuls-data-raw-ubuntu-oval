Then,in the following call graph:  ip_do_fragment()    ip_skb_dst_mtu()      ip_dst_mtu_maybe_forward()        ip_mtu_locked()the pointer to struct dst_entry is used as pointer to struct rtable: thisturns the access to struct members like rt_mtu_locked into an OOB read inthe stack. Fix this changing the temporary variable used for IPv4 packetsin ovs_fragment(), similarly to what is done for IPv6 few lines below.",
