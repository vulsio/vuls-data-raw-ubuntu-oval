		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/pm: Update intermediate power state for SI Update the current stateas boot state during dpm initialization. During the subsequentinitialization, set_power_state gets called to transition to the finalpower state. set_power_state refers to values from the current state andwithout current state populated, it could result in NULL pointerdereference. For ex: on platforms where PCI speed change is supportedthrough ACPI ATCS method, the link speed of current state needs to bequeried before deciding on changing to final power state's link speed. Thelogic to query ATCS-support was broken on certain platforms. The issuebecame visible when broken ATCS-support logic got fixed with commitf9b7f3703ff9 (\"drm/amdgpu/acpi: make ATPX/ATCS structures global (v2)\").Bug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1698\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47362` to fix the vulnerability.
