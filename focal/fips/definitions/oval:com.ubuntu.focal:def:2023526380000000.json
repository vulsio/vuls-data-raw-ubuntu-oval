		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlockThe following 3 locks would race against each other, causing thedeadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:- j1939_socks_lock- active_session_list_lock- sk_session_queue_lockA reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since inthe rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked listthat j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt toacquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency,where, for example, the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lockand attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time,another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holdingsk_session_queue_lock.NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bugreported by Syzbot; instead, it solves a deadlock situation to preparefor one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, whichappears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.[mkl: remove unrelated newline change]",
