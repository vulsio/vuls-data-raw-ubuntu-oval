		"description": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. The `xmlattr` filter in affectedversions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters.XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each wouldthen be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an applicationaccepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders thesein pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to injectother attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressedspaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is nowexplicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, andcode that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flaggedas insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user inputcontinues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.",
