		"Title": "CVE-2020-26555 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "Bluetooth legacy BR/EDR PIN code pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 1.0B through 5.2 may permit an unauthenticated nearby device to spoof the BD_ADDR of the peer device to complete pairing without knowledge of the PIN. It was discovered that the BR/EDR pin-code pairing procedure in the Linux kernel was vulnerable to an impersonation attack. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to pair to a device without knowledge of the pin-code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26555` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-80.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1054-aws - 5.4.0-1054.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-aws - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-azure - 5.4.0-1055.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1009-azure - 5.13.0-1009.10~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1055.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1016-bluefield - 5.4.0-1016.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gcp - 5.4.0-1049.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-gcp - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gke - 5.4.0-1049.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gkeop - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic-64k - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-lowlatency - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-kvm - 5.4.0-1044.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-oracle - 5.4.0-1052.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-oracle - 5.13.0-1011.13~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1041-raspi - 5.4.0-1041.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-80.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1054-aws - 5.4.0-1054.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-aws - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-azure - 5.4.0-1055.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1009-azure - 5.13.0-1009.10~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1055.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1016-bluefield - 5.4.0-1016.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gcp - 5.4.0-1049.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-gcp - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gke - 5.4.0-1049.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gkeop - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic-64k - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-lowlatency - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-kvm - 5.4.0-1044.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-oracle - 5.4.0-1052.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-oracle - 5.13.0-1011.13~20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
