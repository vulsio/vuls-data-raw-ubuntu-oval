This bypasses the restrictions imposed onusers who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### PatchesThis has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to olderversions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommendedthat you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### Referenceshttps://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140 ### For more information If you haveany questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in[HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress)",
