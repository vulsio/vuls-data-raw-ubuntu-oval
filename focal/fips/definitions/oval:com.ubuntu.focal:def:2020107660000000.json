		"Title": "CVE-2020-10766 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A logic bug flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation of SSBD. A bug in the logic handling allows an attacker with a local account to disable SSBD protection during a context switch when additional speculative execution mitigations are in place. This issue was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality. It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) mitigations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10766` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-kvm - 5.4.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1020-oem - 5.6.0-1020.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1016-raspi - 5.4.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-kvm - 5.4.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1020-oem - 5.6.0-1020.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required",
