		"description": "Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting withversion 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma buildprocess extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existingin the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in theliblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be usedby any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying thedata interaction with this library.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-3094` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblzma5 - 5.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nxz-utils - 5.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nxzdec - 5.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
