		"description": "This affects all versions of package uvicorn. The request logger providedby the package is vulnerable to ASNI escape sequence injection. Wheneverany HTTP request is received, the default behaviour of uvicorn is to logits details to either the console or a log file. When attackers requestcrafted URLs with percent-encoded escape sequences, the logging componentwill log the URL after it's been processed with urllib.parse.unquote,therefore converting any percent-encoded characters into theirsingle-character equivalent, which can have special meaning in terminalemulators. By requesting URLs with crafted paths, attackers can: * Polluteuvicorn's access logs, therefore jeopardising the integrity of such files.* Use ANSI sequence codes to attempt to interact with the terminal emulatorthat's displaying the logs (either in real time or from a file).",
