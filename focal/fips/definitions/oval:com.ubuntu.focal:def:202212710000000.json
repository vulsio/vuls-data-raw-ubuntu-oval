		"Title": "CVE-2022-1271 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1271` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngzip - 1.10-0ubuntu4.1\ngzip-win32 - 1.10-0ubuntu4.1\nNo subscription required\n\nliblzma5 - 5.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nxz-utils - 5.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nxzdec - 5.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
