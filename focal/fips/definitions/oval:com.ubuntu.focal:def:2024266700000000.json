		"title": "CVE-2024-26670 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: arm64:entry: fix ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD Currently theARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround isn't quite right, asit is supposed to be applied after the last explicit memory access, but isimmediately followed by an LDR. TheARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to handleCortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295, which aredescribed in: *https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en *https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en In bothcases the workaround is described as: | If pagetable isolation is disabled,the context switch logic in the | kernel can be updated to execute thefollowing sequence on affected | cores before exiting to EL0, and after allexplicit memory accesses: | | 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/oraddress, including | unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1Xzr`. | | 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI. The importantpart being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed \"after all explicit memoryaccesses\". Unfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediatelyfollowed by an LDR, as we have: | alternative_ifARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD | tlbi vale1, xzr | dsb nsh |alternative_else_nop_endif | alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 |ldr lr, [sp, #S_LR] | add sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE // restore sp | eret |alternative_else_nop_endif | | [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ] Thispatch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB immediatelybefore the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses. The ERET is currentlyin a separate alternative block, and alternatives cannot be nested. Toaccount for this, the alternative block for ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 isreplaced with a single alternative branch to skip the KPTI logic, with thenew shape of the logic being: | alternative_insn \"b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@\",nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 | [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ] |.L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@: | | ldr lr, [sp, #S_LR] | add sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE// restore sp | | alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD |tlbi vale1, xzr | dsb nsh | alternative_else_nop_endif | eret The newstructure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is not inuse; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the erratum: |Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the | issuefrom occurring. ... and as per the workaround description quoted above, theworkaround is only necessary \"If pagetable isolation is disabled\".",
