This means that sometimes we can increase the refcount in`prepare_fb` and don't decrease it in `cleanup_fb`. The opposite can alsobe true. In fact, the struct drm_plane .state shouldn't be accesseddirectly but instead, the `drm_atomic_get_new_plane_state()` helperfunction should be used. So, we could stick to this check, but using`drm_atomic_get_new_plane_state()`. But actually, this check is not re---truncated---",
