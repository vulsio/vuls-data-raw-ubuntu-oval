		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/qspinlock: Fix deadlock in MCS queueIf an interrupt occurs in queued_spin_lock_slowpath() after we incrementqnodesp->count and before node->lock is initialized, another CPU mightsee stale lock values in get_tail_qnode(). If the stale lock value happensto match the lock on that CPU, then we write to the \"next\" pointer ofthe wrong qnode. This causes a deadlock as the former CPU, once it becomesthe head of the MCS queue, will spin indefinitely until it's \"next\" pointeris set by its successor in the queue.Running stress-ng on a 16 core (16EC/16VP) shared LPAR, results inoccasional lockups similar to the following:   $ stress-ng --all 128 --vm-bytes 80% --aggressive \\               --maximize --oomable --verify  --syslog \\               --metrics  --times  --timeout 5m   watchdog: CPU 15 Hard LOCKUP   ......
