		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ibmvnic: don't release napi in __ibmvnic_open()If __ibmvnic_open() encounters an error such as when setting link state,it calls release_resources() which frees the napi structures needlessly.Instead, have __ibmvnic_open() only clean up the work it did so far (i.e.disable napi and irqs) and leave the rest to the callers.If caller of __ibmvnic_open() is ibmvnic_open(), it should release theresources immediately. If the caller is do_reset() or do_hard_reset(),they will release the resources on the next reset.This fixes following crash that occurred when running the drmgr commandseveral times to add/remove a vnic interface:\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Disabling rx_scrq[6] irq\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Disabling rx_scrq[7] irq\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Replenished 8 pools\tKernel attempted to read user page (10) - exploit attempt?
