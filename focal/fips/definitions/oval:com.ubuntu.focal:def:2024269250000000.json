		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: release mutex after nft_gc_seq_end from abort pathThe commit mutex should not be released during the critical section betweennft_gc_seq_begin() and nft_gc_seq_end(), otherwise, async GC worker couldcollect expired objects and get the released commit lock within the same GCsequence. nf_tables_module_autoload() temporarily releases the mutex toload module dependencies, then it goes back to replay the transactionagain. Move it at the end of the abort phase after nft_gc_seq_end() iscalled.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26925` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-187-generic - 5.4.0-187.207\nlinux-image-5.4.0-187-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-187.207\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-187-generic - 5.4.0-187.207\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-187-lowlatency - 5.4.0-187.207\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-kvm - 5.4.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-aws - 5.4.0-1127.137\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-azure - 5.4.0-1132.139\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-bluefield - 5.4.0-1087.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1131-gcp - 5.4.0-1131.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-gkeop - 5.4.0-1094.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-ibm - 5.4.0-1074.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1039-iot - 5.4.0-1039.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-iot - 5.4.0-1039.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1126-oracle - 5.4.0-1126.135\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1111-raspi - 5.4.0-1111.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1046-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1046.50\nNo subscription required",
