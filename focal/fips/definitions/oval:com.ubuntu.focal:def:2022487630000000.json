		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Forcibly leave nested virt when SMM state is toggledForcibly leave nested virtualization operation if userspace toggles SMMstate via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS or KVM_SYNC_X86_EVENTS.  If userspaceforces the vCPU out of SMM while it's post-VMXON and then injects an SMI,vmx_enter_smm() will overwrite vmx->nested.smm.vmxon and end up with bothvmxon=false and smm.vmxon=false, but all other nVMX state allocated.Don't attempt to gracefully handle the transition as (a) most transitionsare nonsencial, e.g. forcing SMM while L2 is running, (b) there isn'tsufficient information to handle all transitions, e.g. SVM wants accessto the SMRAM save state, and (c) KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS must precedeKVM_SET_NESTED_STATE during state restore as the latter disallows puttingthe vCPU into L2 if SMM is active, and disallows tagging the vCPU asbeing post-VMXON in SMM if SMM is not active.Abuse of KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS manifests as a WARN and memory leak in nVMXdue to failure to free vmcs01's shadow VMCS, but the bug goes far beyondjust a memory leak, e.g. toggling SMM on while L2 is active puts the vCPUin an architecturally impossible state.
