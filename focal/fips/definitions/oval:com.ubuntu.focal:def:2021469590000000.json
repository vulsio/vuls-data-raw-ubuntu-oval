Thiscauses devices registered with devm_spi_alloc_{master,slave}() to bemistakenly identified as legacy, non-devm managed devices and have theirreference counters decremented below 0.------------[ cut here ]------------WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 660 at lib/refcount.c:28refcount_warn_saturate+0x108/0x174[<b0396f04>] (refcount_warn_saturate) from [<b03c56a4>](kobject_put+0x90/0x98)[<b03c5614>] (kobject_put) from [<b0447b4c>] (put_device+0x20/0x24) r4:b6700140[<b0447b2c>] (put_device) from [<b07515e8>](devm_spi_release_controller+0x3c/0x40)[<b07515ac>] (devm_spi_release_controller) from [<b045343c>](release_nodes+0x84/0xc4) r5:b6700180 r4:b6700100[<b04533b8>] (release_nodes) from [<b0454160>](devres_release_all+0x5c/0x60) r8:b1638c54 r7:b117ad94 r6:b1638c10 r5:b117ad94 r4:b163dc10[<b0454104>] (devres_release_all) from [<b044e41c>](__device_release_driver+0x144/0x1ec) r5:b117ad94 r4:b163dc10[<b044e2d8>] (__device_release_driver) from [<b044f70c>](device_driver_detach+0x84/0xa0) r9:00000000 r8:00000000 r7:b117ad94 r6:b163dc54 r5:b1638c10 r4:b163dc10[<b044f688>] (device_driver_detach) from [<b044d274>](unbind_store+0xe4/0xf8)Instead, determine the devm allocation state as a flag on thecontroller which is guaranteed to be stable during cleanup.",
