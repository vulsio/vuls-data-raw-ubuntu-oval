		"Description": "Log injection in SimpleSAMLphp before version 1.18.4. Thewww/erroreport.php script, which receives error reports and sends them viaemail to the system administrator, did not properly sanitize the reportidentifier obtained from the request. This allows an attacker, underspecific circumstances, to inject new log lines by manually crafting thisreport ID. When configured to use the file logging handler, SimpleSAMLphpwill output all its logs by appending each log line to a given file. Sincethe reportID parameter received in a request sent to www/errorreport.phpwas not properly sanitized, it was possible to inject newline charactersinto it, effectively allowing a malicious user to inject new log lines witharbitrary content.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-5225` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsimplesamlphp - 1.18.4-1\nNo subscription required",
