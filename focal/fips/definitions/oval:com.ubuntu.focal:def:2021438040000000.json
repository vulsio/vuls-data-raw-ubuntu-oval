    "Title": "CVE-2021-43804 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this declared length is not checked against the actual received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-43804` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njami - 20190215.1.f152c98~ds1-1+deb10u2build0.20.04.1\njami-daemon - 20190215.1.f152c98~ds1-1+deb10u2build0.20.04.1\nring - 20190215.1.f152c98~ds1-1+deb10u2build0.20.04.1\nring-daemon - 20190215.1.f152c98~ds1-1+deb10u2build0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
