		"Title": "CVE-2021-3923 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA overinfiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernelstack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cmdevice node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive userinformation, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protectionmechanisms.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3923` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-kvm - 5.4.0-1059.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-aws - 5.4.0-1069.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-azure - 5.4.0-1073.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1073.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-bluefield - 5.4.0-1032.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gcp - 5.4.0-1068.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gke - 5.4.0-1066.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gkeop - 5.4.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-oracle - 5.4.0-1067.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1056-raspi - 5.4.0-1056.63\nNo subscription required",
