		"description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.x before 3.6.1. With TLS 1.3, when aserver enables optional authentication of the client, if theclient-provided certificate does not have appropriate values in if keyUsageor extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value ofmbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have theMBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE bitsclear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses otherthan TLS client authentication would nonetheless be able to use it for TLSclient authentication. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only withoptional authentication (with required authentication, the handshake wouldbe aborted with a fatal alert).",
