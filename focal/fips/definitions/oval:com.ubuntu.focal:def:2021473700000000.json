		"title": "CVE-2021-47370 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mptcp:ensure tx skbs always have the MPTCP ext Due to signed/unsigned comparison,the expression: info->size_goal - skb->len > 0 evaluates to true when thesize goal is smaller than the skb size. That results in lack of tx cacherefill, so that the skb allocated by the core TCP code lacks the requiredMPTCP skb extensions. Due to the above, syzbot is able to trigger thefollowing WARN_ON(): WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 810 at net/mptcp/protocol.c:1366mptcp_sendmsg_frag+0x1362/0x1bc0 net/mptcp/protocol.c:1366 Modules linkedin: CPU: 1 PID: 810 Comm: syz-executor.4 Not tainted 5.14.0-syzkaller #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 01/01/2011 RIP: 0010:mptcp_sendmsg_frag+0x1362/0x1bc0net/mptcp/protocol.c:1366 Code: ff 4c 8b 74 24 50 48 8b 5c 24 58 e9 0f fbff ff e8 13 44 8b f8 4c 89 e7 45 31 ed e8 98 57 2e fe e9 81 f4 ff ff e8 fe43 8b f8 <0f> 0b 41 bd ea ff ff ff e9 6f f4 ff ff 4c 89 e7 e8 b9 8e d2 f8e9 RSP: 0018:ffffc9000531f6a0 EFLAGS: 00010216 RAX: 000000000000697f RBX:0000000000000000 RCX: ffffc90012107000 RDX: 0000000000040000 RSI:ffffffff88eac9e2 RDI: 0000000000000003 RBP: ffff888078b15780 R08:0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000 R10: ffffffff88eac017 R11:0000000000000000 R12: ffff88801de0a280 R13: 0000000000006b58 R14:ffff888066278280 R15: ffff88803c2fe9c0 FS: 00007fd9f866e700(0000)GS:ffff8880b9d00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS: 0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 00007faebcb2f718 CR3: 00000000267cb000 CR4:00000000001506e0 DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2:0000000000000000 DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7:0000000000000400 Call Trace: __mptcp_push_pending+0x1fb/0x6b0net/mptcp/protocol.c:1547 mptcp_release_cb+0xfe/0x210net/mptcp/protocol.c:3003 release_sock+0xb4/0x1b0 net/core/sock.c:3206sk_stream_wait_memory+0x604/0xed0 net/core/stream.c:145mptcp_sendmsg+0xc39/0x1bc0 net/mptcp/protocol.c:1749inet6_sendmsg+0x99/0xe0 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:643 sock_sendmsg_nosecnet/socket.c:704 [inline] sock_sendmsg+0xcf/0x120 net/socket.c:724sock_write_iter+0x2a0/0x3e0 net/socket.c:1057 call_write_iterinclude/linux/fs.h:2163 [inline] new_sync_write+0x40b/0x640fs/read_write.c:507 vfs_write+0x7cf/0xae0 fs/read_write.c:594ksys_write+0x1ee/0x250 fs/read_write.c:647 do_syscall_x64arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x35/0xb0arch/x86/entry/common.c:80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae RIP:0033:0x4665f9 Code: ff ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 4889 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05<48> 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 bc ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48 RSP:002b:00007fd9f866e188 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001 RAX:ffffffffffffffda RBX: 000000000056c038 RCX: 00000000004665f9 RDX:00000000000e7b78 RSI: 0000000020000000 RDI: 0000000000000003 RBP:00000000004bfcc4 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000 R10:0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 000000000056c038 R13:0000000000a9fb1f R14: 00007fd9f866e300 R15: 0000000000022000 Fix the issuerewriting the relevant expression to avoid sign-related problems - note:size_goal is always >= 0.
