		"Title": "CVE-2020-26144 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP,WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as longas the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP) headerfor EAPOL. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packetsindependent of the network configuration.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26144` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
