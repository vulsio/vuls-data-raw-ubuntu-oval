		"Title": "CVE-2022-4378 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SYSCTL subsystem in how a user changes certain kernel parameters and variables. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Kyle Zeng discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4378` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-aws - 5.15.0-1028.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-azure - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gcp - 5.15.0-1027.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1056-oem - 5.14.0-1056.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-oracle - 5.15.0-1027.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-aws - 5.15.0-1028.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-azure - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gcp - 5.15.0-1027.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1056-oem - 5.14.0-1056.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-oracle - 5.15.0-1027.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
