		"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 up to and including4.3.0. It allows an attacker (with enough privileges to change the system'shostname) to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory content via astack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems wheregethostname() does not have '\\0' termination of the returned string if thehostname is larger than the supplied buffer. (Linux systems are notaffected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD systems are notaffected because the returned hostname always has '\\0' termination.) Undersome conditions, this issue can lead to the writing of one '\\0' byteout-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial of service or possiblyarbitrary code execution.",
