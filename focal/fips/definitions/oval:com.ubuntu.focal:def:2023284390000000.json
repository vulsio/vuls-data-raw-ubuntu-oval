		"Description": "CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. Across-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting IframeDialog and Media Embed packages. The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScriptcode after fulfilling special conditions: using one of the affectedpackages on a web page with missing proper Content Security Policyconfiguration; initializing the editor on an element and using an elementother than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying the editor instance. Thisvulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend ondynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism. A fix is available inCKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may beconsidered a breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the IframeDialog plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restrictsJavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior,configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embedwidget by default. To change this behavior, configure the`config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to enableeither of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patchedversion should properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid anypotential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements ontheir web page.",
