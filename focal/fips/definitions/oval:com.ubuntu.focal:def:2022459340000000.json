		"Title": "CVE-2022-45934 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. l2cap_config_req in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c has an integer wraparound via L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets. It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45934` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-137-generic - 5.4.0-137.154\nlinux-image-5.4.0-137-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-137.154\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-137-generic - 5.4.0-137.154\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-137-lowlatency - 5.4.0-137.154\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-aws - 5.4.0-1094.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-aws - 5.15.0-1028.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-azure - 5.4.0-1101.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-azure - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1101.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-bluefield - 5.4.0-1058.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-gcp - 5.4.0-1098.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gcp - 5.15.0-1027.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-gke - 5.4.0-1094.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-gkeop - 5.4.0-1062.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-ibm - 5.4.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-kvm - 5.4.0-1084.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1056-oem - 5.14.0-1056.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-oracle - 5.4.0-1092.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-oracle - 5.15.0-1027.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1079-raspi - 5.4.0-1079.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-137-generic - 5.4.0-137.154\nlinux-image-5.4.0-137-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-137.154\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-137-generic - 5.4.0-137.154\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-137-lowlatency - 5.4.0-137.154\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-aws - 5.4.0-1094.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-aws - 5.15.0-1028.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-azure - 5.4.0-1101.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-azure - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1101.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-bluefield - 5.4.0-1058.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-gcp - 5.4.0-1098.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gcp - 5.15.0-1027.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-gke - 5.4.0-1094.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-gkeop - 5.4.0-1062.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-58-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-generic-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-ibm - 5.4.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-kvm - 5.4.0-1084.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1056-oem - 5.14.0-1056.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-oracle - 5.4.0-1092.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-oracle - 5.15.0-1027.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
