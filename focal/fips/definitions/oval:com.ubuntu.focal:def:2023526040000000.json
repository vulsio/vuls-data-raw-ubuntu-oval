The issue is caused when thevalue of lp becomes greater than CTLTREESIZE which is the max size ofstree. Adding a simple check solves this issue. Dave: As the functionreturns a void, good error handling would require a more intrusive codereorganization, so I modified Osama's patch at use WARN_ON_ONCE for lack ofa cleaner option.
