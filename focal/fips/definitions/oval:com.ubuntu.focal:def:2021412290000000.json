    "Title": "CVE-2021-41229 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41229` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbluetooth - 5.53-0ubuntu3.4\nbluez - 5.53-0ubuntu3.4\nbluez-cups - 5.53-0ubuntu3.4\nbluez-hcidump - 5.53-0ubuntu3.4\nbluez-obexd - 5.53-0ubuntu3.4\nbluez-tests - 5.53-0ubuntu3.4\nlibbluetooth3 - 5.53-0ubuntu3.4\nNo subscription required",
