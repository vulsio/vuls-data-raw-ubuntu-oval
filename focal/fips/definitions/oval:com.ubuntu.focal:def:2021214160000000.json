		"Description": "django-registration is a user registration package for Django. Thedjango-registration package provides tools for implementing user-accountregistration flows in the Django web framework. In django-registrationprior to 3.1.2, the base user-account registration view did not properlyapply filters to sensitive data, with the result that sensitive data couldbe included in error reports rather than removed automatically by Django.Triggering this requires: A site is using django-registration < 3.1.2, Thesite has detailed error reports (such as Django's emailed error reports tosite staff/developers) enabled and a server-side error (HTTP 5xx) occursduring an attempt by a user to register an account. Under these conditions,recipients of the detailed error report will see all submitted data fromthe account-registration attempt, which may include the user's proposedcredentials (such as a password).",
