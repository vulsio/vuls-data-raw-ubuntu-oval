		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_configWhen slice_height is 0, the division by slice_height in the calculationof the number of slices will cause a division by zero driver crash. Thisleaves the kernel in a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds acheck to avoid the division by zero.The stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. I reproduced the issue ona Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple Studio Display monitorconnected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed with this exceptionwhen I rebooted the system with the monitor connected.kernel: ? die (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:421arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:434 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:447)kernel: ? do_trap (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:113 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:154)kernel: ? setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpukernel: ? do_error_trap (./arch/x86/include/asm/traps.h:58arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:175)kernel: ? setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpukernel: ? exc_divide_error (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:194 (discriminator 2))kernel: ? setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpukernel: ? asm_exc_divide_error (./arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:548)kernel: ? setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpukernel: dc_dsc_compute_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1109) amdgpuAfter applying this patch, the driver no longer crashes when the monitoris connected and the system is rebooted.
