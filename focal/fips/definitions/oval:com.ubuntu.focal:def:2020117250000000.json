		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** snd_ctl_elem_add in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.3 has a count=info->owner line, which later affects a private_size*count multiplication for unspecified \"interesting side effects.\" NOTE: kernel engineers dispute this finding, because it could be relevant only if new callers were added that were unfamiliar with the misuse of the info->owner field to represent data unrelated to the \"owner\" concept. The existing callers, SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD and SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE, have been designed to misuse the info->owner field in a safe way.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-11725` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1063.66+cvm2.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1063.66+cvm2.2\nNo subscription required",
