		"Description": "When displaying the sender of an email, and the sender name contained theBraille Pattern Blank space character multiple times, Thunderbird wouldhave displayed all the spaces. This could have been used by an attacker tosend an email message with the attacker's digital signature, that was shownwith an arbitrary sender email address chosen by the attacker. If thesender name started with a false email address, followed by many Braillespace characters, the attacker's email address was not visible. BecauseThunderbird compared the invisible sender address with the signature'semail address, if the signing key or certificate was accepted byThunderbird, the email was shown as having a valid digital signature.
