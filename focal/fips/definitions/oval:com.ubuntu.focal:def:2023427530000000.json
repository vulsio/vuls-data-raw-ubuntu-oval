    "Title": "CVE-2023-42753 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - high.",
    "Description": "An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate array offsets, leading to a out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-42753` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-165-generic - 5.4.0-165.182\nlinux-image-5.4.0-165-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-165.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-165-generic - 5.4.0-165.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-165-lowlatency - 5.4.0-165.182\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-aws - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-aws - 5.15.0-1048.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1118-azure - 5.4.0-1118.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-bluefield - 5.4.0-1073.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-gcp - 5.15.0-1045.53~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-gkeop - 5.4.0-1079.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gkeop - 5.15.0-1031.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic-64k - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-ibm - 5.4.0-1059.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-ibm - 5.15.0-1041.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-iot - 5.4.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-iot - 5.4.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-kvm - 5.4.0-1101.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-oracle - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-oracle - 5.15.0-1046.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1096-raspi - 5.4.0-1096.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-165-generic - 5.4.0-165.182\nlinux-image-5.4.0-165-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-165.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-165-generic - 5.4.0-165.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-165-lowlatency - 5.4.0-165.182\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-aws - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-aws - 5.15.0-1048.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1118-azure - 5.4.0-1118.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-bluefield - 5.4.0-1073.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-gcp - 5.15.0-1045.53~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-gkeop - 5.4.0-1079.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gkeop - 5.15.0-1031.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic-64k - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-ibm - 5.4.0-1059.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-ibm - 5.15.0-1041.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-iot - 5.4.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-iot - 5.4.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-kvm - 5.4.0-1101.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-oracle - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-oracle - 5.15.0-1046.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1032-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1032.36\nNo subscription required",
