		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: musb: dsps: Fix the probe error pathCommit 7c75bde329d7 (\"usb: musb: musb_dsps: request_irq() afterinitializing musb\") has inverted the calls todsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() and dsps_create_musb_pdev() withoutupdating correctly the error path. dsps_create_musb_pdev() allocates andregisters a new platform device which must be unregistered and freedwith platform_device_unregister(), and this is missing upondsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() error.While on the master branch it seems not to trigger any issue, I observeda kernel crash because of a NULL pointer dereference with a v5.10.70stable kernel where the patch mentioned above was backported. With thiskernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first timedsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe toerror out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, onthe Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in thesystem is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during theboot phase triggers the crash.My limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commitwhich was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,does not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ tofire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannotever happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the->enable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platformdevice must be already registered in order for the core or any otheruser to use this callback.Hence, I decided to fix the error path, which might prevent futureerrors on mainline kernels while also fixing older ones.",
