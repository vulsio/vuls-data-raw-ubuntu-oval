		"Title": "CVE-2022-0850 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in linux kernel, where an information leak occurs via ext4_extent_header to userspace. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0850` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-84-generic - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-84-lowlatency - 5.4.0-84.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1056-aws - 5.4.0-1056.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-aws - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-azure - 5.4.0-1058.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1009-azure - 5.13.0-1009.10~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1058.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-bluefield - 5.4.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gcp - 5.4.0-1052.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-gcp - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gke - 5.4.0-1052.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-gkeop - 5.4.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic-64k - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-lowlatency - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1004-ibm - 5.4.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-kvm - 5.4.0-1046.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-oracle - 5.4.0-1054.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-oracle - 5.13.0-1011.13~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1043-raspi - 5.4.0-1043.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-84-generic - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-84-lowlatency - 5.4.0-84.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1056-aws - 5.4.0-1056.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-aws - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-azure - 5.4.0-1058.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1009-azure - 5.13.0-1009.10~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1058.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-bluefield - 5.4.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gcp - 5.4.0-1052.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-gcp - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gke - 5.4.0-1052.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-gkeop - 5.4.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic-64k - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-lowlatency - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1004-ibm - 5.4.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-kvm - 5.4.0-1046.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-oracle - 5.4.0-1054.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-oracle - 5.13.0-1011.13~20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
