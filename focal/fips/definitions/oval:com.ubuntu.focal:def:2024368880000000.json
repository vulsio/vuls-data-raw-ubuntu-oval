		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:workqueue: Fix selection of wake_cpu in kick_pool()With cpu_possible_mask=0-63 and cpu_online_mask=0-7 the followingkernel oops was observed:smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...smp: Brought up 1 node, 8 CPUsUnable to handle kernel pointer dereference in virtual kernel address spaceFailing address: 0000000000000000 TEID: 0000000000000803[..] Call Trace:arch_vcpu_is_preempted+0x12/0x80select_idle_sibling+0x42/0x560select_task_rq_fair+0x29a/0x3b0try_to_wake_up+0x38e/0x6e0kick_pool+0xa4/0x198__queue_work.part.0+0x2bc/0x3a8call_timer_fn+0x36/0x160__run_timers+0x1e2/0x328__run_timer_base+0x5a/0x88run_timer_softirq+0x40/0x78__do_softirq+0x118/0x388irq_exit_rcu+0xc0/0xd8do_ext_irq+0xae/0x168ext_int_handler+0xbe/0xf0psw_idle_exit+0x0/0xcdefault_idle_call+0x3c/0x110do_idle+0xd4/0x158cpu_startup_entry+0x40/0x48rest_init+0xc6/0xc8start_kernel+0x3c4/0x5e0startup_continue+0x3c/0x50The crash is caused by calling arch_vcpu_is_preempted() for an offlineCPU. To avoid this, select the cpu with cpumask_any_and_distribute()to mask __pod_cpumask with cpu_online_mask. In case no cpu is left inthe pool, skip the assignment.tj: This doesn't fully fix the bug as CPUs can still go down betweenpickingthe target CPU and the wake call. Fixing that likely requires addingcpu_online() test to either the sched or s390 arch code. However,regardlessof how that is fixed, workqueue shouldn't be picking a CPU which isn'tonline as that would result in unpredictable and worse behavior.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36888` to fix the vulnerability.
