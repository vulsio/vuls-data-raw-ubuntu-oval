Starting in version 3.1.0 andprior to version 3.1.5, Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)vulnerability exists in the `Rack::Request::Helpers` module when parsingHTTP Accept headers. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attackersending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers,causing the server to spend excessive time processing the request andleading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The fix for CVE-2024-26146 was notapplied to the main branch and thus while the issue was fixed for the Rackv3.0 release series, it was not fixed in the v3.1 release series untilv3.1.5. Users of versions on the 3.1 branch should upgrade to version 3.1.5to receive the fix.",
