    "Title": "CVE-2023-3609 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If tcf_change_indev() fails, u32_set_parms() will immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 04c55383fa5689357bcdd2c8036725a55ed632bc. It was discovered that the universal 32bit network packet classifier implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3609` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-159.176\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-lowlatency - 5.4.0-159.176\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-aws - 5.4.0-1108.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-aws - 5.15.0-1043.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-gcp - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-gcp - 5.15.0-1040.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gkeop - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-ibm - 5.15.0-1036.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-kvm - 5.4.0-1097.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-oracle - 5.4.0-1107.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-oracle - 5.15.0-1041.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1092-raspi - 5.4.0-1092.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-159.176\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-lowlatency - 5.4.0-159.176\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-aws - 5.4.0-1108.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-aws - 5.15.0-1043.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-gcp - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-gcp - 5.15.0-1040.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-gkeop - 5.4.0-1075.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gkeop - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-ibm - 5.15.0-1036.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-kvm - 5.4.0-1097.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-oracle - 5.4.0-1107.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-oracle - 5.15.0-1041.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1028-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1028.32\nNo subscription required",
