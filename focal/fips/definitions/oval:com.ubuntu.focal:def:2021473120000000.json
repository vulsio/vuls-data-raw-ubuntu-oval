		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: Fix dereference of null pointer flow In the casewhere chain->flags & NFT_CHAIN_HW_OFFLOAD is false thennft_flow_rule_create is not called and flow is NULL. The subsequent errorhandling execution via label err_destroy_flow_rule will lead to a nullpointer dereference on flow when calling nft_flow_rule_destroy. Since theerror path to err_destroy_flow_rule has to cater for null and non-nullflows, only call nft_flow_rule_destroy if flow is non-null to fix thisissue.
