		"description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A floating pointexception (FPE) due to an integer divide by zero was found in Exiv2versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The FPE is triggered when Exiv2 is used toprint the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentiallyexploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trickthe victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bugis only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which isa less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command lineoption (`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-34335` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nexiv2 - 0.27.2-8ubuntu2.6\nlibexiv2-27 - 0.27.2-8ubuntu2.6\nNo subscription required",
