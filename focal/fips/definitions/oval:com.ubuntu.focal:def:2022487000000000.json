		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/type1: Unpin zero pages There's currently a reference count leak onthe zero page. We increment the reference via pin_user_pages_remote(), butthe page is later handled as an invalid/reserved page, therefore it's notaccounted against the user and not unpinned by our put_pfn(). Introducingspecial zero page handling in put_pfn() would resolve the leak, but withoutaccounting of the zero page, a single user could still create enoughmappings to generate a reference count overflow. The zero page is alwaysresident, so for our purposes there's no reason to keep it pinned.Therefore, add a loop to walk pages returned from pin_user_pages_remote()and unpin any zero pages.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48700` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic-64k - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-aws - 5.15.0-1027.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gcp - 5.15.0-1026.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1012-gkeop - 5.15.0-1012.16~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-ibm - 5.15.0-1033.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-oracle - 5.15.0-1027.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
