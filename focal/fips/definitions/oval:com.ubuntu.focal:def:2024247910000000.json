		"description": "The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds toa request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header with a non-informational(200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection inan invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail.An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy canexploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \"Expect:100-continue\" requests which elicit a non-informational response from thebackend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, andcauses one subsequent request using that connection to fail.",
