		"description": "** DISPUTED ** A Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in NumPy 1.9.x in thePyArray_NewFromDescr_int function of ctors.c when specifying arrays oflarge dimensions (over 32) from Python code, which could let a malicioususer cause a Denial of Service. NOTE: The vendor does not agree this is avulneraility; In (very limited) circumstances a user may be able provokethe buffer overflow, the user is most likely already privileged to at leastprovoke denial of service by exhausting memory. Triggering this furtherrequires the use of uncommon API (complicated structured dtypes), which isvery unlikely to be available to an unprivileged user.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33430` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-numpy - 1:1.17.4-5ubuntu3.1\nNo subscription required",
