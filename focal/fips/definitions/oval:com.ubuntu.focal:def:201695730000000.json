This commit contains the changes in commit 7b28bd2b723 (szukw000:863-862) which originally attempts to fix this issue. Commit a817832c223 (pull request 895 for more information) contains the changes in commit 7b28bd2b723, which fixes more than just issues 862 and 863. This commit, however, was never merged and issue 892, related to this CVE, was instead fixed by another commit: 2fa0fc61f2d (which seems to have introduced a regression, fixed by 784d4d47e97). eslerm> upstream patches are also for issue 970"
