Theqxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by theqxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holdinga reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returnedhandle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to adenial of service or privilege escalation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39198` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-91-generic - 5.15.0-91.101~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-91-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-91.101~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-91-generic - 5.15.0-91.101~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-91-generic-64k - 5.15.0-91.101~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-aws - 5.15.0-1051.56~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1053-azure - 5.15.0-1053.61~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1053-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1053.61~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-ibm - 5.15.0-1044.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-oracle - 5.15.0-1049.55~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
