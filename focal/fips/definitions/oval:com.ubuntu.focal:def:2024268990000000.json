		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:block: fix deadlock between bd_link_disk_holder and partition scan'open_mutex' of gendisk is used to protect open/close block devices. Butin bd_link_disk_holder(), it is used to protect the creation of symlinkbetween holding disk and slave bdev, which introduces some issues.When bd_link_disk_holder() is called, the driver is usually in the processof initialization/modification and may suspend submitting io. At thistime, any io hold 'open_mutex', such as scanning partitions, can causedeadlocks. For example, in raid:T1                              T2bdev_open_by_dev lock open_mutex [1] ...  efi_partition  ...   md_submit_bio\t\t\t\tmd_ioctl mddev_syspend\t\t\t\t  -> suspend all io\t\t\t\t md_add_new_disk\t\t\t\t  bind_rdev_to_array\t\t\t\t   bd_link_disk_holder\t\t\t\t    try lock open_mutex [2]    md_handle_request     -> wait mddev_resumeT1 scan partition, T2 add a new device to raid. T1 waits for T2 to resumemddev, but T2 waits for open_mutex held by T1. Deadlock occurs.Fix it by introducing a local mutex 'blk_holder_mutex' to replace'open_mutex'.",
