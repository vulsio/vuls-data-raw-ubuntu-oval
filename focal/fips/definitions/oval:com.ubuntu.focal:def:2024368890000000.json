If the mptcp worker (dumbly) tries mptcp-levelre-injection after such ack, that would unconditionally trigger a sendbuffer cleanup using 'bad' snd_una values.We could easily disable re-injection for fallback sockets, but suchdumb behavior already helped catching a few subtle issues and a verylow to zero impact in practice.Instead address the issue always initializing snd_nxt (and write_seq,for consistency) at connect time.",
