		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak when canceling rehash work The rehashdelayed work is rescheduled with a delay if the number of credits at end ofthe work is not negative as supposedly it means that the migration ended.Otherwise, it is rescheduled immediately. After \"mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam:Fix possible use-after-free during rehash\" the above is no longer accurateas a non-negative number of credits is no longer indicative of themigration being done. It can also happen if the work encountered an errorin which case the migration will resume the next time the work isscheduled. The significance of the above is that it is possible for thework to be pending and associated with hints that were allocated when themigration started. This leads to the hints being leaked [1] when the workis canceled while pending as part of ACL region dismantle. Fix by freeingthe hints if hints are associated with a work that was canceled whilepending. Blame the original commit since the reliance on not having apending work associated with hints is fragile.
