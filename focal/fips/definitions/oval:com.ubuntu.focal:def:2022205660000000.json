		"Description": "In l2cap_chan_put of l2cap_core, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-165329981References: Upstream kernel Lee Jones discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel.
