    "Title": "CVE-2019-20810 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "go7007_snd_init in drivers/media/usb/go7007/snd-go7007.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6 does not call snd_card_free for a failure path, which causes a memory leak, aka CID-9453264ef586. Chuhong Yuan discovered that go7007 USB audio device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some failure conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-20810` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-kvm - 5.4.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1007-oem - 5.6.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1016-raspi - 5.4.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-kvm - 5.4.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1007-oem - 5.6.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required",
