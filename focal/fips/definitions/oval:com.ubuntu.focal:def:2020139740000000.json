		"Title": "CVE-2020-13974 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.4 through 5.7.1. drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue in this case. It was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use this to have an unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-13974` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-kvm - 5.4.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1018-oem - 5.6.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1016-raspi - 5.4.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-kvm - 5.4.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1018-oem - 5.6.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22\nNo subscription required",
