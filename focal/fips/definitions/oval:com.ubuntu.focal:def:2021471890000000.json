		"title": "CVE-2021-47189 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functionsOrdered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same threadwhich executed the normal work functions. The only way execution betweennormal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,unfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.This manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, whereasync_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causessubmit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs becauseasync_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:    pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0    lr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0    sp : ffff800015d4bc20    <registers omitted for brevity>    Call trace:     submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0     async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0     run_ordered_work+0xc8/0x280     btrfs_work_helper+0x98/0x250     process_one_work+0x1f0/0x4ac     worker_thread+0x188/0x504     kthread+0x110/0x114     ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18Fix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that allaccesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered beforesetting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading ofWORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loadswould be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensuresare all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly orderedbefore any access that can occur in ordered_func.",
