		"title": "CVE-2023-52527 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv4, ipv6: Fix handling of transhdrlen in __ip{,6}_append_data()Including the transhdrlen in length is a problem when the packet ispartially filled (e.g. something like send(MSG_MORE) happened previously)when appending to an IPv4 or IPv6 packet as we don't want to repeat thetransport header or account for it twice.  This can happen under somecircumstances, such as splicing into an L2TP socket.The symptom observed is a warning in __ip6_append_data():    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5042 at net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800__ip6_append_data.isra.0+0x1be8/0x47f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800that occurs when MSG_SPLICE_PAGES is used to append more data to an alreadypartially occupied skbuff.  The warning occurs when 'copy' is larger thanthe amount of data in the message iterator.  This is because the requestedlength includes the transport header length when it shouldn't.  This can betriggered by, for example:        sfd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_L2TP);        bind(sfd, ...); // ::1        connect(sfd, ...); // ::1 port 7        send(sfd, buffer, 4100, MSG_MORE);        sendfile(sfd, dfd, NULL, 1024);Fix this by only adding transhdrlen into the length if the write queue isempty in l2tp_ip6_sendmsg(), analogously to how UDP does things.l2tp_ip_sendmsg() looks like it won't suffer from this problem as it buildsthe UDP packet itself.",
