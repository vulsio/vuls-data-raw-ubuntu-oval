		"title": "CVE-2024-38570 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: gfs2:Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount When a DLM lockspace isreleased and there ares still locks in that lockspace, DLM will unlockthose locks automatically. Commit fb6791d100d1b started exploiting thisbehavior to speed up filesystem unmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks itdidn't want to unlock and then release the lockspace. This didn't take thebast callbacks for asynchronous lock contention notifications into account,which remain active until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace isreleased. To prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects,put the glocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list,release the lockspace, and only then free those glocks. As an additionalmeasure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if the receiving glock isdead.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38570` to fix the vulnerability.
