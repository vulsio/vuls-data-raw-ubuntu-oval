		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pid: take a reference when initializing `cad_pid`During boot, kernel_init_freeable() initializes `cad_pid` to the inittask's struct pid.  Later on, we may change `cad_pid` via a sysctl, andwhen this happens proc_do_cad_pid() will increment the refcount on thenew pid via get_pid(), and will decrement the refcount on the old pidvia put_pid().  As we never called get_pid() when we initialized`cad_pid`, we decrement a reference we never incremented, can thereforefree the init task's struct pid early.  As there can be danglingreferences to the struct pid, we can later encounter a use-after-free(e.g.  when delivering signals).This was spotted when fuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems tohave been around since the conversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid incommit 9ec52099e4b8 (\"[PATCH] replace cad_pid by a struct pid\") from thepre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.Fix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when weassign it to `cad_pid`.Full KASAN splat below.   ==================================================================   BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in ns_of_pid include/linux/pid.h:153 [inline]   BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in task_active_pid_ns+0xc0/0xc8kernel/pid.c:509   Read of size 4 at addr ffff23794dda0004 by task syz-executor.0/273   CPU: 1 PID: 273 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted5.12.0-00001-g9aef892b2d15 #1   Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)   Call trace:    ns_of_pid include/linux/pid.h:153 [inline]    task_active_pid_ns+0xc0/0xc8 kernel/pid.c:509    do_notify_parent+0x308/0xe60 kernel/signal.c:1950    exit_notify kernel/exit.c:682 [inline]    do_exit+0x2334/0x2bd0 kernel/exit.c:845    do_group_exit+0x108/0x2c8 kernel/exit.c:922    get_signal+0x4e4/0x2a88 kernel/signal.c:2781    do_signal arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:882 [inline]    do_notify_resume+0x300/0x970 arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:936    work_pending+0xc/0x2dc   Allocated by task 0:    slab_post_alloc_hook+0x50/0x5c0 mm/slab.h:516    slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:2907 [inline]    slab_alloc mm/slub.c:2915 [inline]    kmem_cache_alloc+0x1f4/0x4c0 mm/slub.c:2920    alloc_pid+0xdc/0xc00 kernel/pid.c:180    copy_process+0x2794/0x5e18 kernel/fork.c:2129    kernel_clone+0x194/0x13c8 kernel/fork.c:2500    kernel_thread+0xd4/0x110 kernel/fork.c:2552    rest_init+0x44/0x4a0 init/main.c:687    arch_call_rest_init+0x1c/0x28    start_kernel+0x520/0x554 init/main.c:1064    0x0   Freed by task 270:    slab_free_hook mm/slub.c:1562 [inline]    slab_free_freelist_hook+0x98/0x260 mm/slub.c:1600    slab_free mm/slub.c:3161 [inline]    kmem_cache_free+0x224/0x8e0 mm/slub.c:3177    put_pid.part.4+0xe0/0x1a8 kernel/pid.c:114    put_pid+0x30/0x48 kernel/pid.c:109    proc_do_cad_pid+0x190/0x1b0 kernel/sysctl.c:1401    proc_sys_call_handler+0x338/0x4b0 fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:591    proc_sys_write+0x34/0x48 fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:617    call_write_iter include/linux/fs.h:1977 [inline]    new_sync_write+0x3ac/0x510 fs/read_write.c:518    vfs_write fs/read_write.c:605 [inline]    vfs_write+0x9c4/0x1018 fs/read_write.c:585    ksys_write+0x124/0x240 fs/read_write.c:658    __do_sys_write fs/read_write.c:670 [inline]    __se_sys_write fs/read_write.c:667 [inline]    __arm64_sys_write+0x78/0xb0 fs/read_write.c:667    __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:37 [inline]    invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:49 [inline]    el0_svc_common.constprop.1+0x16c/0x388 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:129    do_el0_svc+0xf8/0x150 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:168    el0_svc+0x28/0x38 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:416    el0_sync_handler+0x134/0x180 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:432    el0_sync+0x154/0x180 arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:701   The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff23794dda0000    which belongs to the cache pid of size 224   The buggy address is located 4 bytes inside of    224-byte region [ff---truncated---",
