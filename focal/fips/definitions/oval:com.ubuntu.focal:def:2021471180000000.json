		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pid:take a reference when initializing `cad_pid` During boot,kernel_init_freeable() initializes `cad_pid` to the init task's struct pid.Later on, we may change `cad_pid` via a sysctl, and when this happensproc_do_cad_pid() will increment the refcount on the new pid via get_pid(),and will decrement the refcount on the old pid via put_pid(). As we nevercalled get_pid() when we initialized `cad_pid`, we decrement a reference wenever incremented, can therefore free the init task's struct pid early. Asthere can be dangling references to the struct pid, we can later encountera use-after-free (e.g. when delivering signals). This was spotted whenfuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to have been around since theconversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid in commit 9ec52099e4b8 (\"[PATCH]replace cad_pid by a struct pid\") from the pre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.Fix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when weassign it to `cad_pid`.
