It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftops tool. It might allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service or leak memory data.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-12493` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-poppler-0.18 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu3\nlibpoppler-cpp0v5 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu3\nlibpoppler-glib8 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu3\nlibpoppler-qt5-1 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu3\nlibpoppler97 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu3\npoppler-utils - 0.76.1-0ubuntu3\nNo subscription required",
