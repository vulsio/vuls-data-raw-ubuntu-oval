		"title": "CVE-2021-38507 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows aconnection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visualproperties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin withunencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port onthe same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunisticencryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browserto port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling theOpportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerabilityaffects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-38507` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nthunderbird - 1:91.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:91.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:91.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:91.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:91.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:91.5.0+build1-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
