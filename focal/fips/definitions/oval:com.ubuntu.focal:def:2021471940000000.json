		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cfg80211: call cfg80211_stop_ap when switch from P2P_GO typeIf the userspace tools switch from NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_GO toNL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC via send_msg(NL80211_CMD_SET_INTERFACE), itdoes not call the cleanup cfg80211_stop_ap(), this leads to theinitialization of in-use data. For example, this path re-init thesdata->assigned_chanctx_list while it is still an element ofassigned_vifs list, and makes that linked list corrupt.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47194` to fix the vulnerability.
