		"title": "CVE-2024-35969 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6:fix race condition between ipv6_get_ifaddr and ipv6_del_addr Althoughipv6_get_ifaddr walks inet6_addr_lst under the RCU lock, it still meanshlist_for_each_entry_rcu can return an item that got removed from the list.The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCU but nothingguarantees the actual content of the memory is sane. In particular, thereference count can be zero. This can happen if ipv6_del_addr is called inparallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entry from inet6_addr_lst(hlist_del_init_rcu(&ifp->addr_lst)) and drops all references(__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)). With bad enough timing, this canhappen: 1. In ipv6_get_ifaddr, hlist_for_each_entry_rcu returns an entry.2. Then, the whole ipv6_del_addr is executed for the given entry. Thereference count drops to zero and kfree_rcu is scheduled. 3.ipv6_get_ifaddr continues and tries to increments the reference count(in6_ifa_hold). 4. The rcu is unlocked and the entry is freed. 5. The freedentry is returned. Prevent increasing of the reference count in such case.The name in6_ifa_hold_safe is chosen to mimic the existingfib6_info_hold_safe.
