    "Title": "CVE-2023-1859 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in xen_9pfs_front_removet in net/9p/trans_xen.c in Xen transport for 9pfs in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem, possibly leading to a kernel information leak. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer implementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1859` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic -
