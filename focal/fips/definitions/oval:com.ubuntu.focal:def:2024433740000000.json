		"description": "The UNIX editor Vim prior to version 9.1.0678 has a use-after-free error inargument list handling. When adding a new file to the argument list, thistriggers `Buf*` autocommands. If in such an autocommand the buffer that wasjust opened is closed (including the window where it is shown), this causesthe window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argumentlist that we are actually modifying. Once the autocommands are completed,the references to the window and argument list are no longer valid and assuch cause an use-after-free. Impact is low since the user must eitherintentionally add some unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer duringcreation (either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin), but it willcrash Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678.",
