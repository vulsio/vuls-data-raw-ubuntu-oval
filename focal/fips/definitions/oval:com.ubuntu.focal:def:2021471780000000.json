		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: target: core: Avoid smp_processor_id() in preemptible codeThe BUG message \"BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]code\" was observed for TCMU devices with kernel config DEBUG_PREEMPT.The message was observed when blktests block/005 was run on TCMU deviceswith fileio backend or user:zbc backend [1]. The commit 1130b499b4a7(\"scsi: target: tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper\") triggered thesymptom. The commit modified work queue to handle commands and changed'current->nr_cpu_allowed' at smp_processor_id() call.The message was also observed at system shutdown when TCMU devices were notcleaned up [2]. The function smp_processor_id() was called in SCSI hostwork queue for abort handling, and triggered the BUG message. This symptomwas observed regardless of the commit 1130b499b4a7 (\"scsi: target:tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper\").To avoid the preemptible code check at smp_processor_id(), get CPU ID withraw_smp_processor_id() instead. The CPU ID is used for performanceimprovement then thread move to other CPU will not affect the code.[1][   56.468103] run blktests block/005 at 2021-05-12 14:16:38[   57.369473] check_preemption_disabled: 85 callbacks suppressed[   57.369480] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]code: fio/1511[   57.369506] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]code: fio/1510[   57.369512] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]code: fio/1506[   57.369552] caller is __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod][   57.369606] CPU: 4 PID: 1506 Comm: fio Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1+ #34[   57.369613] Hardware name: System manufacturer System Product Name/PRIMEZ270-A, BIOS 1302 03/15/2018[   57.369617] Call Trace:[   57.369621] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]code: fio/1507[   57.369628]  dump_stack+0x6d/0x89[   57.369642]  check_preemption_disabled+0xc8/0xd0[   57.369628] caller is __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod][   57.369655]  __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod][   57.369695]  target_init_cmd+0x76/0x90 [target_core_mod][   57.369732]  tcm_loop_queuecommand+0x109/0x210 [tcm_loop][   57.369744]  scsi_queue_rq+0x38e/0xc40[   57.369761]  __blk_mq_try_issue_directly+0x109/0x1c0[   57.369779]  blk_mq_try_issue_directly+0x43/0x90[   57.369790]  blk_mq_submit_bio+0x4e5/0x5d0[   57.369812]  submit_bio_noacct+0x46e/0x4e0[   57.369830]  __blkdev_direct_IO_simple+0x1a3/0x2d0[   57.369859]  ? set_init_blocksize.isra.0+0x60/0x60[   57.369880]  generic_file_read_iter+0x89/0x160[   57.369898]  blkdev_read_iter+0x44/0x60[   57.369906]  new_sync_read+0x102/0x170[   57.369929]  vfs_read+0xd4/0x160[   57.369941]  __x64_sys_pread64+0x6e/0xa0[   57.369946]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x79/0x100[   57.369958]  do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x70[   57.369965]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae[   57.369973] RIP: 0033:0x7f7ed4c1399f[   57.369979] Code: 08 89 3c 24 48 89 4c 24 18 e8 7d f3 ff ff 4c 8b 54 2418 48 8b 54 24 10 41 89 c0 48 8b 74 24 08 8b 3c 24 b8 11 00 00 00 0f 05<48> 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 31 44 89 c7 48 89 04 24 e8 cd f3 ff ff 48 8b[   57.369983] RSP: 002b:00007ffd7918c580 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX:0000000000000011[   57.369990] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00000000015b4540 RCX:00007f7ed4c1399f[   57.369993] RDX: 0000000000001000 RSI: 00000000015de000 RDI:0000000000000009[   57.369996] RBP: 00000000015b4540 R08: 0000000000000000 R09:0000000000000001[   57.369999] R10: 0000000000e5c000 R11: 0000000000000293 R12:00007f7eb5269a70[   57.370002] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000001000 R15:00000000015b4568[   57.370031] CPU: 7 PID: 1507 Comm: fio Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1+ #34[   57.370036] Hardware name: System manufacturer System Product Name/PRIMEZ270-A, BIOS 1302 03/15/2018[   57.370039] Call Trace:[   57.370045]  dump_stack+0x6d/0x89[   57.370056]  ch---truncated---",
