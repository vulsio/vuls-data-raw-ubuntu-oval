		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: VMCI:Fix memcpy() run-time warning in dg_dispatch_as_host() Syzkaller hit'WARNING in dg_dispatch_as_host' bug. memcpy: detected field-spanning write(size 56) of single field \"&dg_info->msg\" atdrivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_datagram.c:237 (size 24) WARNING: CPU: 0 PID:1555 at drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_datagram.c:237dg_dispatch_as_host+0x88e/0xa60 drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_datagram.c:237Some code commentry, based on my understanding: 544 #defineVMCI_DG_SIZE(_dg) (VMCI_DG_HEADERSIZE + (size_t)(_dg)->payload_size) ///This is 24 + payload_size memcpy(&dg_info->msg, dg, dg_size); Destination =dg_info->msg ---> this is a 24 byte structure(struct vmci_datagram) Source= dg --> this is a 24 byte structure (struct vmci_datagram) Size = dg_size= 24 + payload_size {payload_size = 56-24 =32} -- Syzkaller managed to setpayload_size to 32. 35 struct delayed_datagram_info { 36 structdatagram_entry *entry; 37 struct work_struct work; 38 boolin_dg_host_queue; 39 /* msg and msg_payload must be together. */ 40 structvmci_datagram msg; 41 u8 msg_payload[]; 42 }; So those extra bytes ofpayload are copied into msg_payload[], a run time warning is seen whilefuzzing with Syzkaller. One possible way to fix the warning is to split thememcpy() into two parts -- one -- direct assignment of msg and secondtaking care of payload.
