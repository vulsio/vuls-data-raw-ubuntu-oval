		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:zero-initialize tc skb extension on allocation Function skb_ext_add()doesn't initialize created skb extension with any value and leaves it up tothe user. However, since extension of type TC_SKB_EXT originally containedonly single value tc_skb_ext->chain its users used to just assign the chainvalue without setting whole extension memory to zero first. This assumptionchanged when TC_SKB_EXT extension was extended with additional fields butnot all users were updated to initialize the new fields which leads to useof uninitialized memory afterwards.
