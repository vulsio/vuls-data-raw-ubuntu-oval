		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mmc:sdio: fix possible resource leaks in some error paths If sdio_add_func() orsdio_init_func() fails, sdio_remove_func() can not release the resources,because the sdio function is not presented in these two cases, it won'tcall of_node_put() or put_device(). To fix these leaks, makesdio_func_present() only control whether device_del() needs to be called ornot, then always call of_node_put() and put_device(). In error case insdio_init_func(), the reference of 'card->dev' is not get, to avoidredundant put in sdio_free_func_cis(), move the get_device() tosdio_alloc_func() and put_device() to sdio_release_func(), it can keep theget/put function be balanced. Without this patch, while doing fault injecttest, it can get the following leak reports, after this fix, the leak isgone. unreferenced object 0xffff888112514000 (size 2048): comm\"kworker/3:2\", pid 65, jiffies 4294741614 (age 124.774s) hex dump (first 32bytes): 00 e0 6f 12 81 88 ff ff 60 58 8d 06 81 88 ff ff ..o.....`X...... 1040 51 12 81 88 ff ff 10 40 51 12 81 88 ff ff .@Q......@Q..... backtrace:[<000000009e5931da>] kmalloc_trace+0x21/0x110 [<000000002f839ccb>]mmc_alloc_card+0x38/0xb0 [mmc_core] [<0000000004adcbf6>]mmc_sdio_init_card+0xde/0x170 [mmc_core] [<000000007538fea0>]mmc_attach_sdio+0xcb/0x1b0 [mmc_core] [<00000000d4fdeba7>]mmc_rescan+0x54a/0x640 [mmc_core] unreferenced object 0xffff888112511000(size 2048): comm \"kworker/3:2\", pid 65, jiffies 4294741623 (age 124.766s)hex dump (first 32 bytes): 00 40 51 12 81 88 ff ff e0 58 8d 06 81 88 ff ff.@Q......X...... 10 10 51 12 81 88 ff ff 10 10 51 12 81 88 ff ff..Q.......Q..... backtrace: [<000000009e5931da>] kmalloc_trace+0x21/0x110[<00000000fcbe706c>] sdio_alloc_func+0x35/0x100 [mmc_core][<00000000c68f4b50>] mmc_attach_sdio.cold.18+0xb1/0x395 [mmc_core][<00000000d4fdeba7>] mmc_rescan+0x54a/0x640 [mmc_core]",
