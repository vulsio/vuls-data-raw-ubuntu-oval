		"Title": "CVE-2023-20569 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "A side channel vulnerability on some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure. Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi discovered that some AMD processors utilising speculative execution and branch prediction may allow unauthorised memory reads via a speculative side-channel attack. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-20569` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\namd64-microcode - 3.20191218.1ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-aws - 5.15.0-1047.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gcp - 5.15.0-1044.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gkeop - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic-64k - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-ibm - 5.15.0-1040.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-oracle - 5.15.0-1045.51~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-aws - 5.15.0-1047.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gcp - 5.15.0-1044.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gkeop - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic-64k - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-ibm - 5.15.0-1040.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-oracle - 5.15.0-1045.51~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
