		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sentThis patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Panand Christian Rossow.ACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <=   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a   duplicate (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send an   ACK, drop the segment, and return\".  The \"ignored\" above implies that   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the   ACK check more stringent since any ACK < SND.UNA wouldn't be   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -   MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <= SND.NXT) get through.This can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,by not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.This greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.I added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,even if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.tp->bytes_acked was added in linux-4.2Following packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) showsthe issue at hand:0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3+0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0+0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0+0 listen(3, 1024) = 0// ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //// when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to// 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440.
