		"Title": "CVE-2018-12550 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured touse an ACL file, and that ACL file is empty, or contains only comments orblank lines, then Mosquitto will treat this as though no ACL file has beendefined and use a default allow policy. The new behaviour is to have anempty ACL file mean that all access is denied, which is not a usefulconfiguration but is not unexpected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-12550` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmosquitto1 - 1.5.6-1\nlibmosquittopp1 - 1.5.6-1\nmosquitto - 1.5.6-1\nmosquitto-clients - 1.5.6-1\nNo subscription required",
