		"description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVMsubsystem. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of thelength of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-lengthheap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalateprivileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Theattacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code onthe target system to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2991` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-kvm - 5.4.0-1071.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-bluefield - 5.4.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1066-raspi - 5.4.0-1066.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
