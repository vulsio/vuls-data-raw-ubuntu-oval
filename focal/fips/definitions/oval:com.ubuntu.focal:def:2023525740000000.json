That is incorrectand will trigger null-ptr-deref for vlan->real_dev invlan_dev_hard_header() because team device is not a vlan device. Cacheeth_header_ops in team_setup(), then assign cached header_ops to header_opsof team net device when its type is changed from non-ether to ether to fixthe bug.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52574` to fix the vulnerability.
