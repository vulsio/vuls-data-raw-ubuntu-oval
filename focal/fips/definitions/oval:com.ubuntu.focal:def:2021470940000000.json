		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:x86/mmu: Don't advance iterator after restart due to yielding Afterdropping mmu_lock in the TDP MMU, restart the iterator duringtdp_iter_next() and do not advance the iterator. Advancing the iteratorresults in skipping the top-level SPTE and all its children, which is fatalif any of the skipped SPTEs were not visited before yielding. When zappingall SPTEs, i.e. when min_level == root_level, restarting the iter and theninvoking tdp_iter_next() is always fatal if the current gfn has as a validSPTE, as advancing the iterator results in try_step_side() skipping thecurrent gfn, which wasn't visited before yielding. Sprinkle WARNs oniter->yielded being true in various helpers that are often used inconjunction with yielding, and tag the helper with __must_check to reducethe probabily of improper usage. Failing to zap a top-level SPTE manifestsin one of two ways. If a valid SPTE is skipped by bothkvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() and kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(), the shadow page will beleaked and KVM will WARN accordingly.

But with respect to leaking shadow pages, the bug was introduced byyielding before processing the current gfn. Alternatively,tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() could simply fall through, or callers couldjump to their \"retry\" label. The downside of that approach is thattdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() _must_ be called before anything else in theloop, and there's no easy way to enfornce that requirement. Ideally, KVMwould handling the cond_resched() fully within the iterator macro (the codeis actually quite clean) and avoid this entire class of bugs, but that isextremely difficult do wh ---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47094` to fix the vulnerability.
