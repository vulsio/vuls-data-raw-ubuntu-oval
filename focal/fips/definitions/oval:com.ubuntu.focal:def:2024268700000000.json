		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSv4.2: fix nfs4_listxattr kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102A call to listxattr() with a buffer size = 0 returns the actualsize of the buffer needed for a subsequent call. When size > 0,nfs4_listxattr() does not return an error because eithergeneric_listxattr() or nfs4_listxattr_nfs4_label() consumesexactly all the bytes then size is 0 when callingnfs4_listxattr_nfs4_user() which then triggers the followingkernel BUG:  [   99.403778] kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102!
