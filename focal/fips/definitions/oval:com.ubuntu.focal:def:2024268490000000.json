The message in question matches this policy:[NFTA_TARGET_REV] = NLA_POLICY_MAX(NLA_BE32, 255), but because NLA_BE32size in minlen array is 0, the validation code will read past the malformed(too small) attribute. Note: Other attributes, e.g. BITFIELD32, SINT,UINT.. are also missing: those likely should be added too.",
