		"description": "OWSLib is a Python package for client programming with Open GeospatialConsortium (OGC) web service interface standards, and their related contentmodels. OWSLib's XML parser (which supports both `lxml` and `xml.etree`)does not disable entity resolution, and could lead to arbitrary file readsfrom an attacker-controlled XML payload. This affects all XML parsing inthe codebase. This issue has been addressed in version 0.28.1. All usersare advised to upgrade. The only known workaround is to patch the librarymanually. See `GHSA-8h9c-r582-mggc` for details.",
