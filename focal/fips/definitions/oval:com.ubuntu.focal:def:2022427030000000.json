		"Title": "CVE-2022-42703 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "mm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.7 has a use-after-free related to leaf anon_vma double reuse. Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory allocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to potential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42703` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-132.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-aws - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-aws - 5.15.0-1026.30~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-azure - 5.4.0-1095.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-azure - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1095.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-bluefield - 5.4.0-1050.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-gcp - 5.4.0-1093.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gcp - 5.15.0-1025.32~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-gke - 5.4.0-1087.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-gke - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gkeop - 5.4.0-1057.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-ibm - 5.4.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1021.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-kvm - 5.4.0-1079.85\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-oracle - 5.4.0-1087.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-oracle - 5.15.0-1025.31~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-132.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-aws - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-aws - 5.15.0-1026.30~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-azure - 5.4.0-1095.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-azure - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1095.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-bluefield - 5.4.0-1050.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-gcp - 5.4.0-1093.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gcp - 5.15.0-1025.32~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-gke - 5.4.0-1087.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-gke - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gkeop - 5.4.0-1057.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-ibm - 5.4.0-1037.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1021.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-kvm - 5.4.0-1079.85\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-oracle - 5.4.0-1087.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-oracle - 5.15.0-1025.31~20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
