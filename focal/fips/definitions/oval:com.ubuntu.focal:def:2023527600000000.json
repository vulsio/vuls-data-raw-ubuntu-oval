		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: gfs2:Fix slab-use-after-free in gfs2_qd_dealloc In gfs2_put_super(), whetherwithdrawn or not, the quota should be cleaned up by gfs2_quota_cleanup().Otherwise, struct gfs2_sbd will be freed before gfs2_qd_dealloc (rcucallback) has run for all gfs2_quota_data objects, resulting inuse-after-free. Also, gfs2_destroy_threads() and gfs2_quota_cleanup() isalready called by gfs2_make_fs_ro(), so in gfs2_put_super(), after callinggfs2_make_fs_ro(), there is no need to call them again.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52760` to fix the vulnerability.
