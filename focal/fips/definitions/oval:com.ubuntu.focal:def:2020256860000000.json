		"title": "CVE-2020-25686 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Certified (focal) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query,dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the same nameand forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queriescan be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries forthe same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network tosubstantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to performto forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentionedin the \"Birthday Attacks\" section of RFC5452. If chained withCVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25686` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.80-1.1ubuntu1.2\ndnsmasq-base - 2.80-1.1ubuntu1.2\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.80-1.1ubuntu1.2\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.80-1.1ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
