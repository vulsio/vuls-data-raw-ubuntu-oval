		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When they require assistancefrom the device model, x86 HVM guests must be temporarily de-scheduled. Thedevice model will signal Xen when it has completed its operation, via anevent channel, so that the relevant vCPU is rescheduled. If the devicemodel were to signal Xen without having actually completed the operation,the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle would repeat. If, in addition, Xen isresignalled very quickly, the re-schedule may occur before the de-schedulewas fully complete, triggering a shortcut. This potentially repeatingprocess uses ordinary recursive function calls, and thus could result in astack overflow. A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest cancause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entirehost. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86stubdomains serving HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability.",
