		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: parisc:Fix random data corruption from exception handler The current exceptionhandler implementation, which assists when accessing user space memory, mayexhibit random data corruption if the compiler decides to use a differentregister than the specified register %r29 (defined inASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG) for the error code. If the compiler choose anotherregister, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 andthus trash whatever this register is used for. Looking at the assembly Ifound that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd(). To solve the issue, theeasiest solution would be if it somehow is possible to tell the faulthandler which register is used to hold the error code. Using %0 or %1 inthe inline assembly is not posssible as it will show up as e.g. %r29 (withthe \"%r\" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not convert to an integer.This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach: We extend the__ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word. In thisword we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction \"or%r0,%r0,%reg\", where %reg references the register which the compilerchoosed for the error return code. In case of an access failure, the faulthandler finds the __ex_table entry and can examine the opcode. The usedregister is encoded in the lowest 5 bits, and the fault handler can thenstore -EFAULT into this register. Since we extend the __ex_table to 3 wordswe can't use the BUILDTIME_TABLE_SORT config option any longer.",
