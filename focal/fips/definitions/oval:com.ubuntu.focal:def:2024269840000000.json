This ptrs ptr is set inthe nv50_instobj_acquire called from nvkm_kmap.If Thread A and Thread B both get to nv50_instobj_acquire aroundthe same time, and Thread A hits the refcount_set line, and inlockstep thread B succeeds at refcount_inc_not_zero, there is achance the ptrs value won't have been stored since refcount_setis unordered. Force a memory barrier here, I picked smp_mb, sincewe want it on all CPUs and it's write followed by a read.v2: use paired smp_rmb/smp_wmb.",
