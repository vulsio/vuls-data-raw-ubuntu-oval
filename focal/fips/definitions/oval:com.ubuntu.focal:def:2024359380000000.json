		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath11k: decrease MHI channel buffer length to 8KBCurrently buf_len field of ath11k_mhi_config_qca6390 is assignedwith 0, making MHI use a default size, 64KB, to allocate channelbuffers. This is likely to fail in some scenarios where systemmemory is highly fragmented and memory compaction or reclaim isnot allowed.There is a fail report which is caused by it:kworker/u32:45: page allocation failure: order:4,mode:0x40c00(GFP_NOIO|__GFP_COMP), nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0CPU: 0 PID: 19318 Comm: kworker/u32:45 Not tainted6.8.0-rc3-1.gae4495f-default #1 openSUSE Tumbleweed (unreleased)493b6d5b382c603654d7a81fc3c144d59a1dfcebWorkqueue: events_unbound async_run_entry_fnCall Trace: <TASK> dump_stack_lvl+0x47/0x60 warn_alloc+0x13a/0x1b0 ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5 ? __alloc_pages_direct_compact+0xab/0x210 __alloc_pages_slowpath.constprop.0+0xd3e/0xda0 __alloc_pages+0x32d/0x350 ? mhi_prepare_channel+0x127/0x2d0 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] __kmalloc_large_node+0x72/0x110 __kmalloc+0x37c/0x480 ? mhi_map_single_no_bb+0x77/0xf0 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] ? mhi_prepare_channel+0x127/0x2d0 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] mhi_prepare_channel+0x127/0x2d0 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] __mhi_prepare_for_transfer+0x44/0x80 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] ? __pfx_____mhi_prepare_for_transfer+0x10/0x10 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] device_for_each_child+0x5c/0xa0 ? __pfx_pci_pm_resume+0x10/0x10 ath11k_core_resume+0x65/0x100 [ath11ka5094e22d7223135c40d93c8f5321cf09fd85e4e] ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5 ath11k_pci_pm_resume+0x32/0x60 [ath11k_pci830b7bfc3ea80ebef32e563cafe2cb55e9cc73ec] ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5 dpm_run_callback+0x8c/0x1e0 device_resume+0x104/0x340 ? __pfx_dpm_watchdog_handler+0x10/0x10 async_resume+0x1d/0x30 async_run_entry_fn+0x32/0x120 process_one_work+0x168/0x330 worker_thread+0x2f5/0x410 ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10 kthread+0xe8/0x120 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork+0x34/0x50 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 </TASK>Actually those buffers are used only by QMI target -> host communication.And for WCN6855 and QCA6390, the largest packet size for that is lessthan 6KB. So change buf_len field to 8KB, which results in order 1allocation if page size is 4KB. In this way, we can at least save somememory, and as well as decrease the possibility of allocation failurein those scenarios.Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.0 PCIWLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.30",
