Detailed invoking path asbelow:dwc3_suspend_common()    spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);              <-- 1st    dwc3_gadget_suspend(dwc);        dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect(dwc);            spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);      <-- 2ndThis issue is exposed by commit c7ebd8149ee5 (\"usb: dwc3: gadget: FixNULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend\") that removes the codeof checking whether dwc->gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes thefollowing code is executed and deadlock occurs when trying to get thespinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442(\"usb: dwc3:Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume\") that forgot to removethe lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode duringgadget suspend/resume.",
