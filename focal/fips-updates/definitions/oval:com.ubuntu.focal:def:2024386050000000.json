		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:core: Fix NULL module pointer assignment at card init The commit81033c6b584b (\"ALSA: core: Warn on empty module\") introduced a WARN_ON()for a NULL module pointer passed at snd_card object creation, and it alsowraps the code around it with '#ifdef MODULE'. This works in most cases,but the devils are always in details. \"MODULE\" is defined when the targetcode (i.e. the sound core) is built as a module; but this doesn't mean thatthe caller is also built-in or not. Namely, when only the sound core isbuilt-in (CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a module(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m), the passed module pointer is ignored even if it'snon-NULL, and card->module remains as NULL. This would result in themissing module reference up/down at the device open/close, leading to arace with the code execution after the module removal. For addressing thebug, move the assignment of card->module again out of ifdef. The WARN_ON()is still wrapped with ifdef because the module can be really NULL when allsound drivers are built-in. Note that we keep 'ifdef MODULE' for WARN_ON(),otherwise it would lead to a false-positive NULL module check. Admittedlyit won't catch perfectly, i.e. no check is performed when CONFIG_SND=y.But, it's no real problem as it's only for debugging, and the condition ispretty rare.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38605` to fix the vulnerability.
