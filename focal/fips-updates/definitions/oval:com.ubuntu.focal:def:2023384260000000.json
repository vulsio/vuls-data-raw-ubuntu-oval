    "Title": "CVE-2023-38426 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.4. ksmbd has an out-of-bounds read in smb2_find_context_vals when create_context's name_len is larger than the tag length. It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an out-of- bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38426` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-iot - 5.4.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-iot - 5.4.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1020-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1020.24\nNo subscription required",
