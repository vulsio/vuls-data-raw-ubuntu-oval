		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: vmalloc: ensure vmap_block is initialised before adding to queueCommit 8c61291fd850 (\"mm: fix incorrect vbq reference inpurge_fragmented_block\") extended the 'vmap_block' structure to contain a'cpu' field which is set at allocation time to the id of the initialisingCPU.When a new 'vmap_block' is being instantiated by new_vmap_block(), thepartially initialised structure is added to the local 'vmap_block_queue'xarray before the 'cpu' field has been initialised.  If another CPU isconcurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then itmay perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to anuninitialised index.This has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android: | Internal error: UBSAN: array index out of bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1]PREEMPT SMP | | Call trace: |  purge_fragmented_block+0x204/0x21c |  _vm_unmap_aliases+0x170/0x378 |  vm_unmap_aliases+0x1c/0x28 |  change_memory_common+0x1dc/0x26c |  set_memory_ro+0x18/0x24 |  module_enable_ro+0x98/0x238 |  do_init_module+0x1b0/0x310Move the initialisation of 'vb->cpu' in new_vmap_block() ahead of theaddition to the xarray.",
