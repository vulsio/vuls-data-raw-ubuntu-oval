		"Title": "CVE-2018-2677 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: AWT). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). It was discovered that the AWT component of OpenJDK did not properly restrict the amount of memory allocated when deserializing some objects. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-2677` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u162-b12-1\nNo subscription required",
