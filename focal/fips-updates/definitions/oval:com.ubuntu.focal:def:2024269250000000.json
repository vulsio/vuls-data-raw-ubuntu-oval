		"title": "CVE-2024-26925 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: release mutex after nft_gc_seq_end from abort pathThe commit mutex should not be released during the critical section betweennft_gc_seq_begin() and nft_gc_seq_end(), otherwise, async GC worker couldcollect expired objects and get the released commit lock within the same GCsequence. nf_tables_module_autoload() temporarily releases the mutex toload module dependencies, then it goes back to replay the transactionagain. Move it at the end of the abort phase after nft_gc_seq_end() iscalled.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26925` to fix the vulnerability.
