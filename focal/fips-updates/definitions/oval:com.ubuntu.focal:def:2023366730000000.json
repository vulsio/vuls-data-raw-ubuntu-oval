		"description": "An issue was discovered in Avira Phantom VPN through 2.23.1 for macOS. TheVPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that all IPtraffic to the VPN server's IP address is sent in plaintext outside the VPNtunnel, even if this traffic is not generated by the VPN client, whilesimultaneously using plaintext DNS to look up the VPN server's IP address.This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending traffic toarbitrary IP addresses in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: thetunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer moregenerally to \"ServerIP attack, combined with DNS spoofing, that can leaktraffic to an arbitrary IP address\" rather than to only Avira Phantom VPN.",
