		"description": "To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursiveresolver occasionally attempts to clean up the database. It uses severalmethods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of memorypointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated andthen queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver iscontinuously processing query patterns triggering this type ofcache-database maintenance, `named` may not be able to handle the cleanupevents in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list of queued cleanupevents to grow infinitely large over time, allowing the configured`max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded. This issue affectsBIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.45 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-6516` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbind9 - 1:9.16.48-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nbind9-dnsutils - 1:9.16.48-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nbind9-host - 1:9.16.48-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nbind9-libs - 1:9.16.48-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nbind9-utils - 1:9.16.48-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nbind9utils - 1:9.16.48-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\ndnsutils - 1:9.16.48-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
