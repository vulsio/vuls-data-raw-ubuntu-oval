		"description": "curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerabilityresulting in already freed memory being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticketarrives over a connection. A malicious server can use this in rareunfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in theclient. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 sessiontickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transferin-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If theconnection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer objectmight be freed before the new session is established on that connection andthen the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. Whenusing that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in theobject, making it possible for a remote code execution if the server couldsomehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place inmemory.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-22901` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl4 - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nNo subscription required",
