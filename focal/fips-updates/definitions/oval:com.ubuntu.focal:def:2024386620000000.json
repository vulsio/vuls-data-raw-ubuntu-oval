		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Allow delete from sockmap/sockhash only if update is allowed We have seenan influx of syzkaller reports where a BPF program attached to a tracepointtriggers a locking rule violation by performing a map_delete on asockmap/sockhash. We don't intend to support this artificial use scenario.Extend the existing verifier allowed-program-type check for updatingsockmap/sockhash to also cover deleting from a map. From now on only BPFprograms which were previously allowed to update sockmap/sockhash candelete from these map types.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38662` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-fips - 5.4.0-1092.102\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1092-fips - 5.4.0-1092.102\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1118-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1118.128+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1118-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1118.128+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required",
