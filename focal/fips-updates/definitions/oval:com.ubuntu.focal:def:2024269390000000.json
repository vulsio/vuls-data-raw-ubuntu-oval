		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/i915/vma: Fix UAF on destroy against retire race Object debugging toolswere sporadically reporting illegal attempts to free a still active i915VMA object when parking a GT believed to be idle. [161.359441] ODEBUG: freeactive (active state 0) object: ffff88811643b958 object type: i915_activehint: __i915_vma_active+0x0/0x50 [i915] [161.360082] WARNING: CPU: 5 PID:276 at lib/debugobjects.c:514 debug_print_object+0x80/0xb0 ...

We could prevent from that raceby serializing i915_active_fini() with __active_retire() viaref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from being used, e.g. from__i915_vma_retire() called at the end of __active_retire(), after that VMAhas been already freed by a concurrent i915_vma_destroy() on return fromthe i915_active_fini(). Then, we should rather fix the issue at the VMAlevel, not in i915_active. Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from__gt_park() on last put of the GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressedby holding the GT wakeref long enough for __active_retire() to completebefore that wakeref is released and the GT parked. I believe the issue wasintroduced by commit d93939730347 (\"drm/i915: Remove the vma refcount\")which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from a dropped i915_vma_release(),called on last put of the removed VMA kref, to i915_vma_parked() processingpath called on last put of a GT wakeref. However, its visibility to theobject debugging tool was suppressed by a bug in i915_active that was fixedtwo weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9 (\"drm/i915/active: Fix missingdebug object activation\"). A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquirea GT wakeref by itself. Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly bythe request's active intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, andindirectly on that intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs tothe same GT as the VMA's VM. Those wakerefs are released asynchronously toVMA deactivation. Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT whenactivating it, and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.However, exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPUnever goes idle. Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomiccontexts, use async variant of wakeref put. Also, to avoid circular lockingdependency, take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when bothare needed. v7: Add inline comments with justifications for: - usinguntracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy), - using async variantof _put(), - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT, - alwaysgetting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex. v6: Since__i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing a wakereftracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and there is no othergood place for that. Use untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().v5: Replace \"tile\" with \"GT\" across commit description (Rodrigo), ----truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26939` to fix the vulnerability.
