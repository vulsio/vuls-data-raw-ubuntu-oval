		"Title": "CVE-2021-45485 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3, net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information leak because of certain use of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that IPv6-based attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source addresses. Amit Klein discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel could disclose internal state in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-45485` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-84.94\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-84-generic -
