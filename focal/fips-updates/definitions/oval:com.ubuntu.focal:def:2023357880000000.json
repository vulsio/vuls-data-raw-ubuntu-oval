		"Title": "CVE-2023-35788 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation. Hangyu Hua discovered that the Flower classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-35788` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-generic - 5.4.0-153.170\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-153.170\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-153-generic -
