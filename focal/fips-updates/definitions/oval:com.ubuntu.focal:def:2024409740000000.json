		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/pseries: Enforce hcall result buffer validity and sizeplpar_hcall(), plpar_hcall9(), and related functions expect callers toprovide valid result buffers of certain minimum size. Currently thisis communicated only through comments in the code and the compiler hasno idea.For example, if I write a bug like this:  long retbuf[PLPAR_HCALL_BUFSIZE]; // should be PLPAR_HCALL9_BUFSIZE  plpar_hcall9(H_ALLOCATE_VAS_WINDOW, retbuf, ...);This compiles with no diagnostics emitted, but likely results in stackcorruption at runtime when plpar_hcall9() stores results past the endof the array. (To be clear this is a contrived example and I have notfound a real instance yet.)To make this class of error less likely, we can use explicitly-sizedarray parameters instead of pointers in the declarations for the hcallAPIs. When compiled with -Warray-bounds[1], the code above nowprovokes a diagnostic like this:error: array argument is too small;is of size 32, callee requires at least 72 [-Werror,-Warray-bounds]   60 |                 plpar_hcall9(H_ALLOCATE_VAS_WINDOW, retbuf,      |                 ^                                   ~~~~~~[1] Enabled for LLVM builds but not GCC for now. See commit    0da6e5fd6c37 (\"gcc: disable '-Warray-bounds' for gcc-13 too\") and    related changes.",
