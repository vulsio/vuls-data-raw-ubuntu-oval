This patch refer to arch/arm64/kernel/sleep.S toresolve this issue. From cited commit [1] that explain the problemFunctions which the compiler has instrumented for KASAN place poison on thestack shadow upon entry and remove this poison prior to returning. In thecase of cpuidle, CPUs exit the kernel a number of levels deep in C code.Any instrumented functions on this critical path will leave portions of thestack shadow poisoned. If CPUs lose context and return to the kernel via acold path, we restore a prior context saved in __cpu_suspend_enter areforgotten, and we never remove the poison they placed in the stack shadowarea by functions calls between this and the actual exit of the kernel.Thus, (depending on stackframe layout) subsequent calls to instrumentedfunctions may hit this stale poison, resulting in (spurious) KASAN splatsto the console. To avoid this, clear any stale poison from the idle threadfor a CPU prior to bringing a CPU online. From cited commit [2] Extend tocheck for CONFIG_KASAN_STACK [1] commit 0d97e6d8024c (\"arm64: kasan: clearstale stack poison\") [2] commit d56a9ef84bd0 (\"kasan, arm64: unpoison stackonly with CONFIG_KASAN_STACK\")\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36906` to fix the vulnerability.
