		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tls: fix missing memory barrier in tls_initIn tls_init(), a write memory barrier is missing, and store-storereordering may cause NULL dereference in tls_{setsockopt,getsockopt}.CPU0                               CPU1-----                              -----// In tls_init()// In tls_ctx_create()ctx = kzalloc()ctx->sk_proto = READ_ONCE(sk->sk_prot) -(1)// In update_sk_prot()WRITE_ONCE(sk->sk_prot, tls_prots)     -(2)                                   // In sock_common_setsockopt()                                   READ_ONCE(sk->sk_prot)->setsockopt()                                   // In tls_{setsockopt,getsockopt}()                                   ctx->sk_proto->setsockopt()    -(3)In the above scenario, when (1) and (2) are reordered, (3) can observethe NULL value of ctx->sk_proto, causing NULL dereference.To fix it, we rely on rcu_assign_pointer() which implies the releasebarrier semantic. By moving rcu_assign_pointer() after ctx->sk_proto isinitialized, we can ensure that ctx->sk_proto are visible whenchanging sk->sk_prot.",
