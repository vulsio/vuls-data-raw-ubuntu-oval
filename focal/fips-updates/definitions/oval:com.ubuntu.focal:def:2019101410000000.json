		"description": "A vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector all versionsexcluding 5.0.2, 6.0.3, 7.2.4, 8.0.3 and 8.2.1. A SQL-injectionvulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector'snode_cache.find_node(). This function makes a SQL query using unfiltereddata from a server reporting inspection results (by a POST to the/v1/continue endpoint). Because the API is unauthenticated, the flaw couldbe exploited by an attacker with access to the network on whichironic-inspector is listening. Because of how ironic-inspector uses thequery results, it is unlikely that data could be obtained. However, theattacker could pass malicious data and create a denial of service.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10141` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nironic-inspector - 8.0.0-3\npython3-ironic-inspector - 8.0.0-3\nNo subscription required",
