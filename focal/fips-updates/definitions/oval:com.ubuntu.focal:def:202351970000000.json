		"Title": "CVE-2023-5197 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Addition and removal of rules from chain bindings within the same transaction causes leads to use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit f15f29fd4779be8a418b66e9d52979bb6d6c2325. Kevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle removal of rules from chain bindings in certain circumstances, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-5197` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-aws - 5.15.0-1048.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-gcp - 5.15.0-1045.53~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gkeop - 5.15.0-1031.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic-64k - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-ibm - 5.15.0-1041.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-iot - 5.4.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-oracle - 5.15.0-1046.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-aws - 5.15.0-1048.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-azure - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-gcp - 5.15.0-1045.53~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gkeop - 5.15.0-1031.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-generic-64k - 5.15.0-87.97~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-ibm - 5.15.0-1041.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-iot - 5.4.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-87-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-87.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-oracle - 5.15.0-1046.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1020-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1020.24\nNo subscription required",
