    "Title": "CVE-2023-0210 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A bug affects the Linux kernelâ€™s ksmbd NTLMv2 authentication and is known to crash the OS immediately in Linux-based systems. It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0210` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gke - 5.15.0-1029.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-aws - 5.15.0-1033.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-azure - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1035.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-gcp - 5.15.0-1031.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gke - 5.15.0-1029.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-69-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-generic-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-69-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-69.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-oracle - 5.15.0-1032.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
