		"description": "in-toto is a framework to protect supply chain integrity. The in-totoconfiguration is read from various directories and allows users toconfigure the behavior of the framework. The files are from directoriesfollowing the XDG base directory specification. In versions 1.4.0 andprior, among the files read is `.in_totorc` which is a hidden file in thedirectory in which in-toto is run. If an attacker controls the inputs to asupply chain step, they can mask their activities by also passing in an`.in_totorc` file that includes the necessary exclude patterns andsettings. RC files are widely used in other systems and security issueshave been discovered in their implementations as well. Maintainers found intheir conversations with in-toto adopters that `in_totorc` is not theirpreferred way to configure in-toto. As none of the options supported in`in_totorc` is unique, and can be set elsewhere using API parameters or CLIarguments, the maintainers decided to drop support for `in_totorc`.in-toto's `user_settings` module has been dropped altogether in commit3a21d84f40811b7d191fa7bd17265c1f99599afd. Users may also sandboxfunctionary code as a security measure.",
