		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:blk-iocost: avoid out of bounds shift UBSAN catches undefined behavior inblk-iocost, where sometimes iocg->delay is shifted right by a number thatis too large, resulting in undefined behavior on some architectures. [186.556576] ------------[ cut here ]------------ UBSAN: shift-out-of-boundsin block/blk-iocost.c:1366:23 shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bittype 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long') CPU: 16 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/16Tainted: G S E N 6.9.0-0_fbk700_debug_rc2_kbuilder_0_gc85af715cac0 #1Hardware name: Quanta Twin Lakes MP/Twin Lakes Passive MP, BIOS F09_3A2312/08/2020 Call Trace: <IRQ> dump_stack_lvl+0x8f/0xe0__ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x22c/0x280 iocg_kick_delay+0x30b/0x310ioc_timer_fn+0x2fb/0x1f80 __run_timer_base+0x1b6/0x250 ... Avoid thatundefined behavior by simply taking the \"delay = 0\" branch if the shift istoo large. I am not sure what the symptoms of an undefined value delay willbe, but I suspect it could be more than a little annoying to debug.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36916` to fix the vulnerability.
