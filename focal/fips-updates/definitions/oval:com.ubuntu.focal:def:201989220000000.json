		"description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through5.48. There isn't any check on whether there is enough space in thedestination buffer. The function simply appends all data passed to it. Thevalues of all attributes that are requested are appended to the outputbuffer. There are no size checks whatsoever, resulting in a simple heapoverflow if one can craft a request where the response is large enough tooverflow the preallocated buffer. This issue exists in service_attr_reqgets called by process_request (in sdpd-request.c), which also allocatesthe response buffer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-8922` to fix the vulnerability.
