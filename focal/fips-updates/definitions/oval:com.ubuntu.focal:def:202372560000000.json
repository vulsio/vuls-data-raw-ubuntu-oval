		"description": "In affected libpcap versions during the setup of a remote packet capturethe internal function sock_initaddress() calls getaddrinfo() and possiblyfreeaddrinfo(), but does not clearly indicate to the caller functionwhether freeaddrinfo() still remains to be called after the functionreturns.  This makes it possible in some scenarios that both the functionand its caller call freeaddrinfo() for the same allocated memory block.  Asimilar problem was reported in Apple libpcap, to which Apple assignedCVE-2023-40400.",
