And RCU_INIT_POINTER() assigns theNULL to dev->ip_ptr. As a result, in_dev cannot be obtained throughinetdev_by_index() and then in_dev->mc_list->sources cannot be releasedby ip_mc_del1_src() in the sock_close. Rough call sequence goes like:sock_close-> __sock_release   -> inet_release      -> ip_mc_drop_socket         -> inetdev_by_index         -> ip_mc_leave_src            -> ip_mc_del_src               -> ip_mc_del1_srcSo we still need to call ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() to freein_dev->mc_list->sources.",
