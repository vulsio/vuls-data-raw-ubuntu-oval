		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Fix memory leak in mlx5_core_destroy_cq() error path Prior tothis patch in case mlx5_core_destroy_cq() failed it returns withoutcompleting all destroy operations and that leads to memory leak. Instead,complete the destroy flow before return error. Also movemlx5_debug_cq_remove() to the beginning of mlx5_core_destroy_cq() to besymmetrical with mlx5_core_create_cq(). kmemleak complains on: unreferencedobject 0xc000000038625100 (size 64): comm \"ethtool\", pid 28301, jiffies4298062946 (age 785.380s) hex dump (first 32 bytes): 60 01 48 94 00 00 00c0 b8 05 34 c3 00 00 00 c0 `.H.......4..... 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 db7d c1 00 00 00 c0 ..........}..... backtrace: [<000000009e8643cb>]add_res_tree+0xd0/0x270 [mlx5_core] [<00000000e7cb8e6c>]mlx5_debug_cq_add+0x5c/0xc0 [mlx5_core] [<000000002a12918f>]mlx5_core_create_cq+0x1d0/0x2d0 [mlx5_core] [<00000000cef0a696>]mlx5e_create_cq+0x210/0x3f0 [mlx5_core] [<000000009c642c26>]mlx5e_open_cq+0xb4/0x130 [mlx5_core] [<0000000058dfa578>]mlx5e_ptp_open+0x7f4/0xe10 [mlx5_core] [<0000000081839561>]mlx5e_open_channels+0x9cc/0x13e0 [mlx5_core] [<0000000009cf05d4>]mlx5e_switch_priv_channels+0xa4/0x230 [mlx5_core] [<0000000042bbedd8>]mlx5e_safe_switch_params+0x14c/0x300 [mlx5_core] [<0000000004bc9db8>]set_pflag_tx_port_ts+0x9c/0x160 [mlx5_core] [<00000000a0553443>]mlx5e_set_priv_flags+0xd0/0x1b0 [mlx5_core] [<00000000a8f3d84b>]ethnl_set_privflags+0x234/0x2d0 [<00000000fd27f27c>]genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x108/0x1d0 [<00000000f495e2bb>]genl_family_rcv_msg+0xe4/0x1f0 [<00000000646c5c2c>] genl_rcv_msg+0x78/0x120[<00000000d53e384e>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x74/0x1a0\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47438` to fix the vulnerability.
