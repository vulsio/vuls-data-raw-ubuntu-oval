		"Title": "CVE-2023-3772 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to directly dereference a NULL pointer in xfrm_update_ae_params(), leading to a possible kernel crash and denial of service. Lin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3772` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-166-generic - 5.4.0-166.183\nlinux-image-5.4.0-166-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-166.183\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-166-generic - 5.4.0-166.183\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-166-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-aws - 5.4.0-1113.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-aws - 5.15.0-1049.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1119-azure - 5.4.0-1119.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure - 5.15.0-1051.59~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1051.59~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-bluefield - 5.4.0-1074.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-gcp - 5.4.0-1117.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-gcp - 5.15.0-1046.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gkeop - 5.4.0-1080.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gkeop - 5.15.0-1032.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic-64k - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1060-ibm - 5.4.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-ibm - 5.15.0-1042.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1045.51~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1025-iot - 5.4.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-iot - 5.4.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-kvm - 5.4.0-1102.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-lowlatency - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-oracle - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-oracle - 5.15.0-1047.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1097-raspi - 5.4.0-1097.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-166-generic - 5.4.0-166.183\nlinux-image-5.4.0-166-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-166.183\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-166-generic - 5.4.0-166.183\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-166-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-aws - 5.4.0-1113.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-aws - 5.15.0-1049.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1119-azure - 5.4.0-1119.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure - 5.15.0-1051.59~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1051.59~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-bluefield - 5.4.0-1074.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-gcp - 5.4.0-1117.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-gcp - 5.15.0-1046.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gkeop - 5.4.0-1080.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gkeop - 5.15.0-1032.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-88-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-generic-64k - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1060-ibm - 5.4.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-ibm - 5.15.0-1042.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1045.51~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1025-iot - 5.4.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-iot - 5.4.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-kvm - 5.4.0-1102.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-lowlatency - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-88-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-88.98~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-oracle - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-oracle - 5.15.0-1047.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1033-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required",
