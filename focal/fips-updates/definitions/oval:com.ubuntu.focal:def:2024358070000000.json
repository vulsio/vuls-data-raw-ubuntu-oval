		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: fix corruption during on-line resizeWe observed a corruption during on-line resize of a file system that islarger than 16 TiB with 4k block size. With having more then 2^32 blocksresize_inode is turned off by default by mke2fs. The issue can bereproduced on a smaller file system for convenience by explicitlyturning off resize_inode. An on-line resize across an 8 GiB boundary (thesize of a meta block group in this setup) then leads to a corruption:  dev=/dev/<some_dev> # should be >= 16 GiB  mkdir -p /corruption  /sbin/mke2fs -t ext4 -b 4096 -O ^resize_inode $dev $((2 * 2**21 - 2**15))  mount -t ext4 $dev /corruption  dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 of=/corruption/test count=$((2*2**21 - 4*2**15))  sha1sum /corruption/test  # 79d2658b39dcfd77274e435b0934028adafaab11  /corruption/test  /sbin/resize2fs $dev $((2*2**21))  # drop page cache to force reload the block from disk  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  sha1sum /corruption/test  # 3c2abc63cbf1a94c9e6977e0fbd72cd832c4d5c3  /corruption/test2^21 = 2^15*2^6 equals 8 GiB whereof 2^15 is the number of blocks perblock group and 2^6 are the number of block groups that make a metablock group.The last checksum might be different depending on how the file is laidout across the physical blocks. The actual corruption occurs at physicalblock 63*2^15 = 2064384 which would be the location of the backup of themeta block group's block descriptor. During the on-line resize the filesystem will be converted to meta_bg starting at s_first_meta_bg which is2 in the example - meaning all block groups after 16 GiB. However, inext4_flex_group_add we might add block groups that are not part of thefirst meta block group yet. In the reproducer we achieved this bysubstracting the size of a whole block group from the point where themeta block group would start. This must be considered when updating thebackup block group descriptors to follow the non-meta_bg layout. The fixis to add a test whether the group to add is already part of the metablock group or not.",
