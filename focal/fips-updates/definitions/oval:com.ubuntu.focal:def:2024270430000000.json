		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is setequal to dvbdev, which is freed in several error-handling paths. However,*pdvbdev is not set to NULL after dvbdev's deallocation, causinguse-after-frees in many places, for example, in the following call chain:budget_register |-> dvb_dmxdev_init |-> dvb_register_device |->dvb_dmxdev_release |-> dvb_unregister_device |-> dvb_remove_device |->dvb_device_put |-> kref_put When calling dvb_unregister_device,dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in dvb_register_device) could point to memorythat had been freed in dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer istransferred to kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27043` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-113-generic - 5.15.0-113.123~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-113-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-113.123~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-113-generic - 5.15.0-113.123~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-113-generic-64k - 5.15.0-113.123~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1063-aws - 5.15.0-1063.69~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1065-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1065.74~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1062-gcp - 5.15.0-1062.70~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-gkeop - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1058-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1058.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-110-lowlatency - 5.15.0-110.120~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-110-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-110.120~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
