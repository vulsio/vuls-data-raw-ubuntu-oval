		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: scsi_debug: Don't call kcalloc() if size arg is zeroIf the size arg to kcalloc() is zero, it returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR.  Because ofthat, for a following NULL pointer check to work on the returned pointer,kcalloc() must not be called with the size arg equal to zero. Return earlywithout error before the kcalloc() call if size arg is zero.BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in memcpy include/linux/fortify-string.h:191[inline]BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in sg_copy_buffer+0x138/0x240lib/scatterlist.c:974Write of size 4 at addr 0000000000000010 by task syz-executor.1/22789CPU: 1 PID: 22789 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 5.15.0-syzk #1Hardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS 1.13.0-2Call Trace: __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:88 [inline] dump_stack_lvl+0x89/0xb5 lib/dump_stack.c:106 __kasan_report mm/kasan/report.c:446 [inline] kasan_report.cold.14+0x112/0x117 mm/kasan/report.c:459 check_region_inline mm/kasan/generic.c:183 [inline] kasan_check_range+0x1a3/0x210 mm/kasan/generic.c:189 memcpy+0x3b/0x60 mm/kasan/shadow.c:66 memcpy include/linux/fortify-string.h:191 [inline] sg_copy_buffer+0x138/0x240 lib/scatterlist.c:974 do_dout_fetch drivers/scsi/scsi_debug.c:2954 [inline] do_dout_fetch drivers/scsi/scsi_debug.c:2946 [inline] resp_verify+0x49e/0x930 drivers/scsi/scsi_debug.c:4276 schedule_resp+0x4d8/0x1a70 drivers/scsi/scsi_debug.c:5478 scsi_debug_queuecommand+0x8c9/0x1ec0 drivers/scsi/scsi_debug.c:7533 scsi_dispatch_cmd drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1520 [inline] scsi_queue_rq+0x16b0/0x2d40 drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1699 blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list+0xb9b/0x2700 block/blk-mq.c:1639 __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x28f/0x590 block/blk-mq-sched.c:325 blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x105/0x190 block/blk-mq-sched.c:358 __blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0xe5/0x150 block/blk-mq.c:1761 __blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue+0x4f8/0x5c0 block/blk-mq.c:1838 blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x18d/0x350 block/blk-mq.c:1891 blk_mq_sched_insert_request+0x3db/0x4e0 block/blk-mq-sched.c:474 blk_execute_rq_nowait+0x16b/0x1c0 block/blk-exec.c:62 blk_execute_rq+0xdb/0x360 block/blk-exec.c:102 sg_scsi_ioctl drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c:621 [inline] scsi_ioctl+0x8bb/0x15c0 drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c:930 sg_ioctl_common+0x172d/0x2710 drivers/scsi/sg.c:1112 sg_ioctl+0xa2/0x180 drivers/scsi/sg.c:1165 vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline] __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:874 [inline] __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:860 [inline] __x64_sys_ioctl+0x19d/0x220 fs/ioctl.c:860 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x80 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae",
