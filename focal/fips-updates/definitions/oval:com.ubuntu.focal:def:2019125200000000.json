		"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7 and 5. When receiving arequest, Squid checks its cache to see if it can serve up a response. Itdoes this by making a MD5 hash of the absolute URL of the request. Iffound, it servers the request. The absolute URL can include the decodedUserInfo (username and password) for certain protocols. This decoded infois prepended to the domain. This allows an attacker to provide a usernamethat has special characters to delimit the domain, and treat the rest ofthe URL as a path or query string. An attacker could first make a requestto their domain using an encoded username, then when a request for thetarget domain comes in that decodes to the exact URL, it will serve theattacker's HTML instead of the real HTML. On Squid servers that also act asreverse proxies, this allows an attacker to gain access to features thatonly reverse proxies can use, such as ESI.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-12520` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 4.10-1ubuntu1\nsquid-cgi - 4.10-1ubuntu1\nsquid-common - 4.10-1ubuntu1\nsquid-purge - 4.10-1ubuntu1\nsquidclient - 4.10-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
