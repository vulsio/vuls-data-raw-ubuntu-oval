		"Title": "CVE-2021-43816 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - low",
		"Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. On installations usingSELinux, such as EL8 (CentOS, RHEL), Fedora, or SUSE MicroOS, withcontainerd since v1.5.0-beta.0 as the backing container runtime interface(CRI), an unprivileged pod scheduled to the node may bind mount, viahostPath volume, any privileged, regular file on disk for completeread/write access (sans delete). Such is achieved by placing thein-container location of the hostPath volume mount at either `/etc/hosts`,`/etc/hostname`, or `/etc/resolv.conf`. These locations are being relabeledindiscriminately to match the container process-label which effectivelyelevates permissions for savvy containers that would not normally be ableto access privileged host files. This issue has been resolved in version1.5.9. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-43816` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncontainerd - 1.5.9-0ubuntu1~20.04.4\nNo subscription required",
