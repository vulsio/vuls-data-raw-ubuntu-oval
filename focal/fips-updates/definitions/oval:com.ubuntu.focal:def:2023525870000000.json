		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:IB/ipoib: Fix mcast list locking Releasing the `priv->lock` while iteratingthe `priv->multicast_list` in `ipoib_mcast_join_task()` opens a window for`ipoib_mcast_dev_flush()` to remove the items while in the middle ofiteration. If the mcast is removed while the lock was dropped, the for loopspins forever resulting in a hard lockup (as was reported on RHEL4.18.0-372.75.1.el8_6 kernel): Task A (kworker/u72:2 below) | Task B(kworker/u72:0 below)-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------ipoib_mcast_join_task(work) | ipoib_ib_dev_flush_light(work)spin_lock_irq(&priv->lock) | __ipoib_ib_dev_flush(priv, ...)list_for_each_entry(mcast, | ipoib_mcast_dev_flush(dev = priv->dev)&priv->multicast_list, list) | ipoib_mcast_join(dev, mcast) |spin_unlock_irq(&priv->lock) | | spin_lock_irqsave(&priv->lock, flags) |list_for_each_entry_safe(mcast, tmcast, | &priv->multicast_list, list) |list_del(&mcast->list); | list_add_tail(&mcast->list, &remove_list) |spin_unlock_irqrestore(&priv->lock, flags) spin_lock_irq(&priv->lock) | |ipoib_mcast_remove_list(&remove_list) (Here, `mcast` is no longer on the |list_for_each_entry_safe(mcast, tmcast, `priv->multicast_list` and we keep| remove_list, list) spinning on the `remove_list` of | >>>wait_for_completion(&mcast->done) the other thread which is blocked | andthe list is still valid on | it's stack.) Fix this by keeping the lock heldand changing to GFP_ATOMIC to prevent eventual sleeps. Unfortunately wecould not reproduce the lockup and confirm this fix but based on the codereview I think this fix should address such lockups. crash> bc 31 PID: 747TASK: ff1c6a1a007e8000 CPU: 31 COMMAND: \"kworker/u72:2\" -- [exception RIP:ipoib_mcast_join_task+0x1b1] RIP: ffffffffc0944ac1 RSP: ff646f199a8c7e00RFLAGS: 00000002 RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ff1c6a1a04dc82f8 RCX:0000000000000000 work (&priv->mcast_task{,.work}) RDX: ff1c6a192d60ac68RSI: 0000000000000286 RDI: ff1c6a1a04dc8000 &mcast->list RBP:ff646f199a8c7e90 R8: ff1c699980019420 R9: ff1c6a1920c9a000 R10:ff646f199a8c7e00 R11: ff1c6a191a7d9800 R12: ff1c6a192d60ac00 mcast R13:ff1c6a1d82200000 R14: ff1c6a1a04dc8000 R15: ff1c6a1a04dc82d8 dev priv(&priv->lock) &priv->multicast_list (aka head) ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffffCS: 0010 SS: 0018 --- <NMI exception stack> --- #5 [ff646f199a8c7e00]ipoib_mcast_join_task+0x1b1 at ffffffffc0944ac1 [ib_ipoib] #6[ff646f199a8c7e98] process_one_work+0x1a7 at ffffffff9bf10967 crash> rxff646f199a8c7e68 ff646f199a8c7e68: ff1c6a1a04dc82f8 <<< work =&priv->mcast_task.work crash> list -hO ipoib_dev_priv.multicast_listff1c6a1a04dc8000 (empty) crash>ipoib_dev_priv.mcast_task.work.func,mcast_mutex.owner.counterff1c6a1a04dc8000 mcast_task.work.func = 0xffffffffc0944910<ipoib_mcast_join_task>, mcast_mutex.owner.counter = 0xff1c69998efec000crash> b 8 PID: 8 TASK: ff1c69998efec000 CPU: 33 COMMAND: \"kworker/u72:0\"-- #3 [ff646f1980153d50] wait_for_completion+0x96 at ffffffff9c7d7646 #4[ff646f1980153d90] ipoib_mcast_remove_list+0x56 at ffffffffc0944dc6[ib_ipoib] #5 [ff646f1980153de8] ipoib_mcast_dev_flush+0x1a7 atffffffffc09455a7 [ib_ipoib] #6 [ff646f1980153e58]__ipoib_ib_dev_flush+0x1a4 at ffffffffc09431a4 [ib_ipoib] #7 [ff---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52587` to fix the vulnerability.
