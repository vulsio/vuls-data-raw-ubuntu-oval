		"description": "**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-basedtoolchains that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existingbuffer overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your applicationwithout this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies toC99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created usingalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sizedlocal variables. The default behavior when the stack-protector detects anoverflow is to terminate your application, resulting in controlled loss ofavailability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer overflow withouttriggering the stack-protector might be able to change program flow controlto cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to go further and affectconfidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is amissed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.",
