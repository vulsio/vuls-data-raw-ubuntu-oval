This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-24000` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 88.0+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 88.0+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 88.0+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
