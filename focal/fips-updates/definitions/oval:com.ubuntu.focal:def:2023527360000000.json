		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec Several functions that takepart in codec's initialization and removal are re-used by ASoC codecdrivers implementations. Drivers mimic the behavior ofhda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c withtheir component->probe/remove() instead. One of the reasons for that is theexpectation of snd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to aninstance of struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once soundcard components probing commences. As ASoC sound card may be unboundwithout codec device being actually removed from the system, unsetting->preset in snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with moduleunload -> load scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned onlyonce, during device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's modulereloading may occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audiostack.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52736` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-72-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-generic-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-aws - 5.15.0-1036.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1038.45~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-gcp - 5.15.0-1034.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-gkeop - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-ibm - 5.15.0-1033.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-72-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-72.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-oracle - 5.15.0-1035.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
