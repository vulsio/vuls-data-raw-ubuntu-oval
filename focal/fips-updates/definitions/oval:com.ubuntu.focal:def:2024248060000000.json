		"title": "CVE-2024-24806 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium",
		"description": "libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windowscounterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 charactersbefore calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to createaddresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by`getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve tounintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerabilityarises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in`uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it getstruncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may beable to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) thatallows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services thatcrawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if amalicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has beenaddressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Thereare no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
