		"description": "Asciidoctor in versions < 1.5.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denialof service (infinite loop). The loop was caused by the fact thatParser.next_block was not exhausting all the lines in the reader as thewhile loop expected it would. This was happening because the regularexpression that detects any list was not agreeing with the regularexpression that detects a specific list type. So the line kept gettingpushed back onto the reader, hence causing the loop.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18385` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nasciidoctor - 1.5.8-1\nruby-asciidoctor - 1.5.8-1\nNo subscription required",
