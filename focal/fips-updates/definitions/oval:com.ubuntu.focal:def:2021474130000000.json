		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:chipidea: ci_hdrc_imx: Also search for 'phys' phandle When passing 'phys'in the devicetree to describe the USB PHY phandle (which is the recommendedway according to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/ci-hdrc-usb2.txt)the following NULL pointer dereference is observed on i.MX7 and i.MX8MM: [1.489344] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtualaddress 0000000000000098 [ 1.498170] Mem abort info: [ 1.500966] ESR =0x96000044 [ 1.504030] EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [1.509356] SET = 0, FnV = 0 [ 1.512416] EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [ 1.515569] FSC =0x04: level 0 translation fault [ 1.520458] Data abort info: [ 1.523349]ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000044 [ 1.527196] CM = 0, WnR = 1 [ 1.530176][0000000000000098] user address but active_mm is swapper [ 1.536544]Internal error: Oops: 96000044 [#1] PREEMPT SMP [ 1.542125] Modules linkedin: [ 1.545190] CPU: 3 PID: 7 Comm: kworker/u8:0 Not tainted 5.14.0-dirty#3 [ 1.551901] Hardware name: Kontron i.MX8MM N801X S (DT) [ 1.557133]Workqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func [ 1.562984] pstate:80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--) [ 1.568998] pc :imx7d_charger_detection+0x3f0/0x510 [ 1.573973] lr :imx7d_charger_detection+0x22c/0x510 This happens because the chargerfunctions check for the phy presence inside the imx_usbmisc_data structure(data->usb_phy), but the chipidea core populates the usb_phy passed via'phys' inside 'struct ci_hdrc' (ci->usb_phy) instead. This causes the NULLpointer dereference inside imx7d_charger_detection(). Fix it by alsosearching for 'phys' in case 'fsl,usbphy' is not found. Tested on aimx7s-warp board.",
