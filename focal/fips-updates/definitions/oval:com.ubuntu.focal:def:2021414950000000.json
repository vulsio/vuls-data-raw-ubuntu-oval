		"description": "** DISPUTED ** Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability exists in numpy.sortin NumPy &lt and 1.19 in the PyArray_DescrNew function due to missingreturn-value validation, which allows attackers to conduct DoS attacks byrepetitively creating sort arrays. NOTE: While correct that validation ismissing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If theuser can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should bepractically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memoryexhaustion to occur at exactly this place.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41495` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-numpy - 1:1.17.4-5ubuntu3.1\nNo subscription required",
