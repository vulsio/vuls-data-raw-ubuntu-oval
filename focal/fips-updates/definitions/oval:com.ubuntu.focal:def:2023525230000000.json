		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf,sockmap: Reject sk_msg egress redirects to non-TCP sockets With aSOCKMAP/SOCKHASH map and an sk_msg program user can steer messages sentfrom one TCP socket (s1) to actually egress from another TCP socket (s2):tcp_bpf_sendmsg(s1) // = sk_prot->sendmsg tcp_bpf_send_verdict(s1) //__SK_REDIRECT case tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir(s2) tcp_bpf_push_locked(s2)tcp_bpf_push(s2) tcp_rate_check_app_limited(s2) // expects tcp_socktcp_sendmsg_locked(s2) // ditto There is a hard-coded assumption in thecall-chain, that the egress socket (s2) is a TCP socket. However in commit122e6c79efe1 (\"sock_map: Update sock type checks for UDP\") we have enabledredirects to non-TCP sockets. This was done for the sake of BPF sk_skbprograms. There was no indention to support sk_msg send-to-egress use case.As a result, attempts to send-to-egress through a non-TCP socket lead to acrash due to invalid downcast from sock to tcp_sock: BUG: kernel NULLpointer dereference, address: 000000000000002f ...
