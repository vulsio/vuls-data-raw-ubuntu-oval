This is ultimately due tothe region(s), that this memdev is a member, being torn down and expectingto be able to de-reference @cxlds, like here:static int cxl_region_decode_reset(struct cxl_region *cxlr, int count)...                if (cxlds->rcd)                        goto endpoint_reset;...Fix it by keeping the driver context valid until memdev-deviceunregistration, and subsequently the entire stack of relateddependencies, unwinds.",
