		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:IB/mlx5: Fix init stage error handling to avoid double free of same QP andUAFIn the unlikely event that workqueue allocation fails and returns NULL inmlx5_mkey_cache_init(), delete the call tomlx5r_umr_resource_cleanup() (which frees the QP) inmlx5_ib_stage_post_ib_reg_umr_init().  This will avoid attempted doublefree of the same QP when __mlx5_ib_add() does its cleanup.Resolves a splat:   Syzkaller reported a UAF in ib_destroy_qp_user   workqueue: Failed to create a rescuer kthread for wq \"mkey_cache\":-EINTR   infiniband mlx5_0: mlx5_mkey_cache_init:981:(pid 1642):   failed to create work queue   infiniband mlx5_0: mlx5_ib_stage_post_ib_reg_umr_init:4075:(pid 1642):   mr cache init failed -12   ==================================================================   BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in ib_destroy_qp_user(drivers/infiniband/core/verbs.c:2073)   Read of size 8 at addr ffff88810da310a8 by task repro_upstream/1642   Call Trace:   <TASK>   kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:590)   ib_destroy_qp_user (drivers/infiniband/core/verbs.c:2073)   mlx5r_umr_resource_cleanup (drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/umr.c:198)   __mlx5_ib_add (drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/main.c:4178)   mlx5r_probe (drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/main.c:4402)   ...   </TASK>   Allocated by task 1642:   __kmalloc (./include/linux/kasan.h:198 mm/slab_common.c:1026   mm/slab_common.c:1039)   create_qp (./include/linux/slab.h:603 ./include/linux/slab.h:720   ./include/rdma/ib_verbs.h:2795 drivers/infiniband/core/verbs.c:1209)   ib_create_qp_kernel (drivers/infiniband/core/verbs.c:1347)   mlx5r_umr_resource_init (drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/umr.c:164)   mlx5_ib_stage_post_ib_reg_umr_init(drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/main.c:4070)   __mlx5_ib_add (drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/main.c:4168)   mlx5r_probe (drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/main.c:4402)   ...
