    "Description": "Linux Kernel nftables Out-Of-Bounds Read/Write Vulnerability; nft_byteorder poorly handled vm register contents when CAP_NET_ADMIN is in any user or network namespace Tanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-35001` to fix the vulnerability.
