		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue() If a non-rootcgroup gets removed when there is a thread that registered trigger and ispolling on a pressure file within the cgroup, the polling waitqueue getsfreed in the following path: do_rmdir cgroup_rmdir kernfs_drain_open_filescgroup_file_release cgroup_pressure_release psi_trigger_destroy However,the polling thread still has a reference to the pressure file and willaccess the freed waitqueue when the file is closed or upon exit: fputep_eventpoll_release ep_free ep_remove_wait_queue remove_wait_queue Thisresults in use-after-free as pasted below. The fundamental problem here isthat cgroup_file_release() (and consequently waitqueue's lifetime) is nottied to the file's real lifetime. Using wake_up_pollfree() here might beless than ideal, but it is in line with the comment at commit 42288cb44c4b(\"wait: add wake_up_pollfree()\") since the waitqueue's lifetime is not tiedto file's one and can be considered as another special case. While thiswould be fixable by somehow making cgroup_file_release() be tied to thefput(), it would require sizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layerwhich might be more justifiable if we identify more cases like this.
