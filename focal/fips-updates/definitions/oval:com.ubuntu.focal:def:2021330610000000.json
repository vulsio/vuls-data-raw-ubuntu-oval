		"Title": "CVE-2021-33061 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "Insufficient control flow management for the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. Asaf Modelevsky discovered that the Intel(R) 10GbE PCI Express (ixgbe) Ethernet driver for the Linux kernel performed insufficient control flow management. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33061` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-lowlatency - 5.4.0-125.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-aws - 5.4.0-1084.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-aws - 5.15.0-1019.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-azure - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-bluefield - 5.4.0-1045.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-gcp - 5.4.0-1087.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gcp - 5.15.0-1017.23~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-gke - 5.4.0-1081.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-gke - 5.15.0-1015.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gkeop - 5.4.0-1052.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-ibm - 5.4.0-1032.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-kvm - 5.4.0-1074.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1049-oem - 5.14.0-1049.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-oracle - 5.4.0-1082.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-oracle - 5.15.0-1017.22~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1069-raspi - 5.4.0-1069.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-lowlatency - 5.4.0-125.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-aws - 5.4.0-1084.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-aws - 5.15.0-1019.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-azure - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-bluefield - 5.4.0-1045.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-gcp - 5.4.0-1087.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gcp - 5.15.0-1017.23~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-gke - 5.4.0-1081.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-gke - 5.15.0-1015.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gkeop - 5.4.0-1052.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-ibm - 5.4.0-1032.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-kvm - 5.4.0-1074.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1049-oem - 5.14.0-1049.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-oracle - 5.4.0-1082.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-oracle - 5.15.0-1017.22~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
