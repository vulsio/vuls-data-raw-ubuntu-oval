		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:handle chunk tree lookup error in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() The unhandledcase in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption, as it could becaused only by two impossible conditions: - at first the search key is setup to look for a chunk tree item, with offset -1, this is an inexact searchand the key->offset will contain the correct offset upon a successfulsearch, a valid chunk tree item cannot have an offset -1 - after firstsuccessful search, the found_key corresponds to a chunk item, the offset isdecremented by 1 before the next loop, it's impossible to find a chunk itemthere due to alignment and size constraints\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35936` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209\nlinux-image-5.4.0-189-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-189.209\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1116-kvm - 5.4.0-1116.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1133-azure - 5.4.0-1133.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1088-bluefield - 5.4.0-1088.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-gcp - 5.4.0-1132.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-gkeop - 5.4.0-1095.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-ibm - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required",
