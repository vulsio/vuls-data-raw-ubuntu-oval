		"description": "In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages areshipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not tolocalize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However,due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's implicitinitialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-codedpath `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And sinceany authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (andsince `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible forlow-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe`will pick them up in version 2.40.1. This vulnerability is relatively hardto exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimatemessage at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the userto direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user mightthink that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does requirelocal write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vectorless likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Someworkarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with sharedaccounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty.Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to createfolders in `C:\\`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25815` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngit - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-all - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-cvs - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-daemon-run - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-daemon-sysvinit - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-el - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-email - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-gui - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-man - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-mediawiki - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngit-svn - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngitk - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\ngitweb - 1:2.25.1-1ubuntu3.11\nNo subscription required",
