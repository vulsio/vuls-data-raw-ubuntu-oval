		"title": "CVE-2023-28100 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium",
		"description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxeddesktop applications on Linux. Versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4,and 1.15.4 contain a vulnerability similar to CVE-2017-5226, but using the`TIOCLINUX` ioctl command instead of `TIOCSTI`. If a Flatpak app is run ona Linux virtual console such as `/dev/tty1`, it can copy text from thevirtual console and paste it into the command buffer, from which thecommand might be run after the Flatpak app has exited. Ordinary graphicalterminal emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and Konsole are unaffected.This vulnerability is specific to the Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`,`/dev/tty2` and so on. A patch is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8,1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtualconsole. Flatpak is primarily designed to be used in a Wayland or X11graphical environment.",
