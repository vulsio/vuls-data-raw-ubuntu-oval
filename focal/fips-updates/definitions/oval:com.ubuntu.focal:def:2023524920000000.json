		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function__dma_async_device_channel_register() can fail. In case of failure,chan->local is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan->local is nullified.When dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of managed API orintentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are unconditionallyunregistered, leading to this NULL pointer: [ 1.318693] Unable to handlekernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000d0 [...] [1.484499] Call trace: [ 1.486930] device_del+0x40/0x394 [ 1.490314]device_unregister+0x20/0x7c [ 1.494220]__dma_async_device_channel_unregister+0x68/0xc0 Look atdma_async_device_register() function error path, channel deviceunregistration is done only if chan->local is not NULL. Then add the samecondition at the beginning of __dma_async_device_channel_unregister()function, to avoid NULL pointer issue whatever the API used to reach thisfunction.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52492` to fix the vulnerability.
