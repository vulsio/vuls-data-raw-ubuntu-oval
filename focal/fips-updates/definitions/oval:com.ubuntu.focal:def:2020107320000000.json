		"Title": "CVE-2020-10732 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of Userspace core dumps. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to crash a trivial program and exfiltrate private kernel data. It was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10732` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-40.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-kvm - 5.4.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1018-oem - 5.6.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1013-raspi - 5.4.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-40.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-kvm - 5.4.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.6.0-1018-oem - 5.6.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19\nNo subscription required",
