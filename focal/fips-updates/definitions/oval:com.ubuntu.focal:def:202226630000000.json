		"Title": "CVE-2022-2663 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured. David Leadbeater discovered that the netfilter IRC protocol tracking implementation in the Linux Kernel incorrectly handled certain message payloads in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or bypass firewall filtering.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2663` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic -
