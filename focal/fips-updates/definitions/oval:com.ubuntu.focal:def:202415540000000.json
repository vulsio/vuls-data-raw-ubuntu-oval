		"description": "The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as thecache key did not include the optional headers `fetch()` may contain. Underthe correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to poison thelocal browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()` response controlled bythe additional headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would seethe cached response instead of the expected response. This vulnerabilityaffects Firefox < 123.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-1554` to fix the vulnerability.
