		"title": "CVE-2023-38545 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - high",
		"description": "This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxyhandshake. When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done bycurl itself, the maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes. If thehost name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name resolvingand instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug, the localvariable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the wrongvalue during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copythe too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just theresolved address there. The target buffer being a heap based buffer, andthe host name coming from the URL that curl has been told to operate with.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38545` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.19\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.19\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.19\nlibcurl4 - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.19\nNo subscription required",
