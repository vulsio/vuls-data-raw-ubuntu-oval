		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:blk-iocost: Fix an UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warningWhen iocg_kick_delay() is called from a CPU different than the one whichsetthe delay, @now may be in the past of @iocg->delay_at leading to thefollowing warning:  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:1359:23  shift exponent 18446744073709 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka'unsigned long long')  ...  Call Trace:   <TASK>   dump_stack_lvl+0x79/0xc0   __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x2ab/0x300   iocg_kick_delay+0x222/0x230   ioc_rqos_merge+0x1d7/0x2c0   __rq_qos_merge+0x2c/0x80   bio_attempt_back_merge+0x83/0x190   blk_attempt_plug_merge+0x101/0x150   blk_mq_submit_bio+0x2b1/0x720   submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x320/0x3e0   __swap_writepage+0x2ab/0x9d0The underflow itself doesn't really affect the behavior in any meaningfulway; however, the past timestamp may exaggerate the delay amount calculatedlater in the code, which shouldn't be a material problem given the natureofthe delay mechanism.If @now is in the past, this CPU is racing another CPU which recently setupthe delay and there's nothing this CPU can contribute w.r.t. the delay.Let's bail early from iocg_kick_delay() in such cases.",
