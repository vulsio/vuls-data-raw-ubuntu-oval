		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_config When slice_heightis 0, the division by slice_height in the calculation of the number ofslices will cause a division by zero driver crash. This leaves the kernelin a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds a check to avoid thedivision by zero. The stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. Ireproduced the issue on a Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple StudioDisplay monitor connected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed withthis exception when I rebooted the system with the monitor connected.kernel: ? die (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:421arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:434 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:447) kernel: ?do_trap (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:113 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:154) kernel: ?setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel:? do_error_trap (./arch/x86/include/asm/traps.h:58arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:175) kernel: ? setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel:? exc_divide_error (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:194 (discriminator 2)) kernel:? setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel:? asm_exc_divide_error (./arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:548) kernel: ?setup_dsc_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu kernel:dc_dsc_compute_config(drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1109) amdgpu Afterapplying this patch, the driver no longer crashes when the monitor isconnected and the system is rebooted.
