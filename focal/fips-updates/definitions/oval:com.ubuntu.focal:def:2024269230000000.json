		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()Garbage collector does not take into account the risk of embryo gettingenqueued during the garbage collection. If such embryo has a peer thatcarries SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() may see adifferent set of children. Leading to an incorrectly elevated inflightcount, and then a dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list.sockets are AF_UNIX/SOCK_STREAMS is an unconnected socketL is a listening in-flight socket bound to addr, not in fdtableV's fd will be passed via sendmsg(), gets inflight count bumpedconnect(S, addr)\tsendmsg(S, [V]); close(V)\t__unix_gc()----------------\t-------------------------\t-----------NS = unix_create1()skb1 = sock_wmalloc(NS)L = unix_find_other(addr)unix_state_lock(L)unix_peer(S) = NS\t\t\t// V count=1 inflight=0 \t\t\tNS = unix_peer(S) \t\t\tskb2 = sock_alloc()\t\t\tskb_queue_tail(NS, skb2[V])\t\t\t// V became in-flight\t\t\t// V count=2 inflight=1\t\t\tclose(V)\t\t\t// V count=1 inflight=1\t\t\t// GC candidate condition met\t\t\t\t\t\tfor u in gc_inflight_list:\t\t\t\t\t\t  if (total_refs == inflight_refs)\t\t\t\t\t\t    add u to gc_candidates\t\t\t\t\t\t// gc_candidates={L, V}\t\t\t\t\t\tfor u in gc_candidates:\t\t\t\t\t\t  scan_children(u, dec_inflight)\t\t\t\t\t\t// embryo (skb1) was not\t\t\t\t\t\t// reachable from L yet, so V's\t\t\t\t\t\t// inflight remains unchanged__skb_queue_tail(L, skb1)unix_state_unlock(L)\t\t\t\t\t\tfor u in gc_candidates:\t\t\t\t\t\t  if (u.inflight)\t\t\t\t\t\t    scan_children(u, inc_inflight_move_tail)\t\t\t\t\t\t// V count=1 inflight=2 (!)If there is a GC-candidate listening socket, lock/unlock its state. Thismakes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. Afterflipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And ifthere is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. Atthis point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is alreadytaken. Inflight graph remains unaffected.",
