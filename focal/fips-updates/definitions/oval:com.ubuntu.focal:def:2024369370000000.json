		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xdp: use flags field to disambiguate broadcast redirectWhen redirecting a packet using XDP, the bpf_redirect_map() helper will setup the redirect destination information in struct bpf_redirect_info (usingthe __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() helper function), and the xdp_do_redirect()function will read this information after the XDP program returns and passthe frame on to the right redirect destination.When using the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag to do multicast redirect to a wholemap, __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() sets the 'map' pointer in structbpf_redirect_info to point to the destination map to be broadcast. Andxdp_do_redirect() reacts to the value of this map pointer to decide whetherit's dealing with a broadcast or a single-value redirect. However, if thedestination map is being destroyed before xdp_do_redirect() is called, themap pointer will be cleared out (by bpf_clear_redirect_map()) withoutwaiting for any XDP programs to stop running. This causes xdp_do_redirect()to think that the redirect was to a single target, but the target pointeris also NULL (since broadcast redirects don't have a single target), sothis causes a crash when a NULL pointer is passed to dev_map_enqueue().To fix this, change xdp_do_redirect() to react directly to the presence ofthe BPF_F_BROADCAST flag in the 'flags' value in struct bpf_redirect_infoto disambiguate between a single-target and a broadcast redirect. And onlyread the 'map' pointer if the broadcast flag is set, aborting if that hasbeen cleared out in the meantime. This prevents the crash, while keepingthe atomic (cmpxchg-based) clearing of the map pointer itself, and withoutadding any more checks in the non-broadcast fast path.",
