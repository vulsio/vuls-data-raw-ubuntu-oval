		"description": "pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker whouses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft aPDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the currentprocess and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does notaffect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-usermanipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDFor by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0. As aworkaround, apply the patch manually by modifying`pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`.",
