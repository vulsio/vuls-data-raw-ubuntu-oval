		"Title": "CVE-2023-38703 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other than UDP. This vulnerabilityâ€™s impact may range from unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch.",
