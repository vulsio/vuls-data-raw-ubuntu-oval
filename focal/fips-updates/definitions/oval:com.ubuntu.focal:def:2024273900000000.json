		"title": "CVE-2024-27390 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6:mcast: remove one synchronize_net() barrier in ipv6_mc_down() As discussedin the past (commit 2d3916f31891 (\"ipv6: fix skb drops inigmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()\")) I think thesynchronize_net() call in ipv6_mc_down() is not needed. Under load,synchronize_net() can last between 200 usec and 5 ms. KASAN seems to agreeas well.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27390` to fix the vulnerability.
