		"Title": "CVE-2022-0168 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A denial of service (DOS) issue was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s smb2_ioctl_query_info function in the fs/cifs/smb2ops.c Common Internet File System (CIFS) due to an incorrect return from the memdup_user function. This flaw allows a local, privileged (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) attacker to crash the system. Billy Jheng Bing Jhong discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate arguments to ioctl() in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0168` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1036-oem - 5.14.0-1036.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1091-raspi - 5.4.0-1091.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1114-azure - 5.4.0-1114.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1008.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-bluefield - 5.4.0-1068.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gke - 5.4.0-1105.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gkeop - 5.4.0-1074.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-41-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-41-generic-64k - 5.15.0-41.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1008-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1008.11~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-iot - 5.4.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-kvm - 5.4.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-42-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-42.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1036-oem - 5.14.0-1036.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1027-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1027.31\nNo subscription required",
