		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/pci: Skip to handle RAS errors if CXL.mem device is detachedThe PCI AER model is an awkward fit for CXL error handling. While theexpectation is that a PCI device can escalate to link reset to recoverfrom an AER event, the same reset on CXL amounts to a surprise memoryhotplug of massive amounts of memory.At present, the CXL error handler attempts some optimistic errorhandling to unbind the device from the cxl_mem driver after reaping someRAS register values. This results in a \"hopeful\" attempt to unplug thememory, but there is no guarantee that will succeed.A subsequent AER notification after the memdev unbind event can nolonger assume the registers are mapped. Check for memdev bind beforereaping status register values to avoid crashes of the form: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffa00000195e9100 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page [...] RIP: 0010:__cxl_handle_ras+0x30/0x110 [cxl_core] [...] Call Trace:  <TASK>  ? __die+0x24/0x70  ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160  ? kernelmode_fixup_or_oops+0x84/0x110  ? exc_page_fault+0x113/0x170  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30  ? __pfx_dpc_reset_link+0x10/0x10  ? __cxl_handle_ras+0x30/0x110 [cxl_core]  ? find_cxl_port+0x59/0x80 [cxl_core]  cxl_handle_rp_ras+0xbc/0xd0 [cxl_core]  cxl_error_detected+0x6c/0xf0 [cxl_core]  report_error_detected+0xc7/0x1c0  pci_walk_bus+0x73/0x90  pcie_do_recovery+0x23f/0x330Longer term, the unbind and PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT behavior mightneed to be replaced with a new PCI_ERS_RESULT_PANIC.",
