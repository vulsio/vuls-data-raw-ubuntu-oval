		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/swap: fix race when skipping swapcacheWhen skipping swapcache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO, if two or more threadsswapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages (A, B).Before one thread (T0) finishes the swapin and installs page (A) to thePTE, another thread (T1) could finish swapin of page (B), swap_free theentry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry.It breaks the pte_same check in (T0) because PTE value is unchanged,causing ABA problem.  Thread (T0) will install a stalled page (A) into thePTE and cause data corruption.One possible callstack is like this:CPU0                                 CPU1----                                 ----do_swap_page()                       do_swap_page() with same entry<direct swapin path>                 <direct swapin path><alloc page A>                       <alloc page B>swap_read_folio() <- read to page A  swap_read_folio() <- read to page B<slow on later locks or interrupt>   <finished swapin first>...                                  set_pte_at()                                     swap_free() <- entry is free                                     <write to page B, now page A stalled>                                     <swap out page B to same swap entry>pte_same() <- Check pass, PTE seems              unchanged, but page A              is stalled!swap_free() <- page B content lost!set_pte_at() <- staled page A installed!And besides, for ZRAM, swap_free() allows the swap device to discard theentry content, so even if page (B) is not modified, if swap_read_folio()on CPU0 happens later than swap_free() on CPU1, it may also cause dataloss.To fix this, reuse swapcache_prepare which will pin the swap entry usingthe cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent anyparallel code from putting the entry in the cache.  Release the pin afterPT unlocked.Racers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event.  Aschedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) call is added to avoid repeated pagefaults wasting too much CPU, causing livelock or adding too much noise toperf statistics.  A similar livelock issue was described in commit029c4628b2eb (\"mm: swap: get rid of livelock in swapin readahead\")Reproducer:This race issue can be triggered easily using a well constructedreproducer and patched brd (with a delay in read path) [1]:With latest 6.8 mainline, race caused data loss can be observed easily:$ gcc -g -lpthread test-thread-swap-race.c && ./a.out  Polulating 32MB of memory region...

Round 0 Failed, 15 data loss!This reproducer spawns multiple threads sharing the same memory regionusing a small swap device.  Every two threads updates mapped pages one byone in opposite direction trying to create a race, with one dedicatedthread keep swapping out the data out using madvise.The reproducer created a reproduce rate of about once every 5 minutes, sothe race should be totally possible in production.After this patch, I ran the reproducer for over a few hundred rounds andno data loss observed.Performance overhead is minimal, microbenchmark swapin 10G from 32Gzram:Before:     10934698 usAfter:      11157121 usCached:     13155355 us (Dropping SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO flag)[kasong@tencent.com: v4]  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240219082040.7495-1-ryncsn@gmail.com",
