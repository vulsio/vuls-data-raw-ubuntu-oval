Hold rcu lock as accessing ftrace pages inftrace_location_range(); 2. Use ftrace_location_range() instead oflookup_rec() in ftrace_location(); 3. Call synchronize_rcu() before freeingany ftrace pages both inftrace_process_locs()/ftrace_release_mod()/ftrace_free_mem().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38588` to fix the vulnerability.
