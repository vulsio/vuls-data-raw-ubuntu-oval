		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: stmmac: move the EST lock to struct stmmac_privReinitialize the whole EST structure would also reset the mutexlock which is embedded in the EST structure, and then triggerthe following warning. To address this, move the lock to structstmmac_priv. We also need to reacquire the mutex lock when doingthis initialization.DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(lock->magic != lock)WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 505 at kernel/locking/mutex.c:587__mutex_lock+0xd84/0x1068 Modules linked in: CPU: 3 PID: 505 Comm: tc Not tainted 6.9.0-rc6-00053-g0106679839f7-dirty#29 Hardware name: NXP i.MX8MPlus EVK board (DT) pstate: 60000005 (nZCv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) pc : __mutex_lock+0xd84/0x1068 lr : __mutex_lock+0xd84/0x1068 sp : ffffffc0864e3570 x29: ffffffc0864e3570 x28: ffffffc0817bdc78 x27: 0000000000000003 x26: ffffff80c54f1808 x25: ffffff80c9164080 x24: ffffffc080d723ac x23: 0000000000000000 x22: 0000000000000002 x21: 0000000000000000 x20: 0000000000000000 x19: ffffffc083bc3000 x18: ffffffffffffffff x17: ffffffc08117b080 x16: 0000000000000002 x15: ffffff80d2d40000 x14: 00000000000002da x13: ffffff80d2d404b8 x12: ffffffc082b5a5c8 x11: ffffffc082bca680 x10: ffffffc082bb2640 x9 : ffffffc082bb2698 x8 : 0000000000017fe8 x7 : c0000000ffffefff x6 : 0000000000000001 x5 : ffffff8178fe0d48 x4 : 0000000000000000 x3 : 0000000000000027 x2 : ffffff8178fe0d50 x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : 0000000000000000 Call trace:  __mutex_lock+0xd84/0x1068  mutex_lock_nested+0x28/0x34  tc_setup_taprio+0x118/0x68c  stmmac_setup_tc+0x50/0xf0  taprio_change+0x868/0xc9c",
