Inaffected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to loadand execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating theprocessed input stream. A user is only affected if using the version out ofthe box with JDK 1.7u21 or below.

No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setupXStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimalrequired types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, sinceit cannot be secured for general purpose.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-39139` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibxstream-java - 1.4.11.1-1ubuntu0.3\nNo subscription required",
