		"Title": "CVE-2022-3621 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component nilfs2. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211920. It was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3621` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-135.152\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-lowlatency - 5.4.0-135.152\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-aws - 5.4.0-1092.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-aws - 5.15.0-1026.30~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-azure - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-gcp - 5.4.0-1096.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gcp - 5.15.0-1025.32~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-gke - 5.4.0-1090.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-gke - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1060-gkeop - 5.4.0-1060.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-ibm - 5.4.0-1040.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1021.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-kvm - 5.4.0-1082.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-oracle - 5.4.0-1090.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-oracle - 5.15.0-1025.31~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1077-raspi - 5.4.0-1077.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-135.152\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-lowlatency - 5.4.0-135.152\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-aws - 5.4.0-1092.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-aws - 5.15.0-1026.30~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-azure - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-gcp - 5.4.0-1096.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-gcp - 5.15.0-1025.32~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-gke - 5.4.0-1090.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-gke - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1060-gkeop - 5.4.0-1060.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-56-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-generic-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-ibm - 5.4.0-1040.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1021.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-kvm - 5.4.0-1082.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-56-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-56.62~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1055-oem - 5.14.0-1055.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-oracle - 5.4.0-1090.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-oracle - 5.15.0-1025.31~20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
