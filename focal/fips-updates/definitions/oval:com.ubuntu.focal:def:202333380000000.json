    "Title": "CVE-2023-3338 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DECnet networking protocol. This issue could allow a remote user to crash the system. Davide Ornaghi discovered that the DECnet network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. Please note that kernel support for the DECnet has been removed to resolve this CVE.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3338` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-lowlatency - 5.4.0-164.181\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-aws - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-aws - 5.15.0-1047.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-azure - 5.4.0-1117.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-bluefield - 5.4.0-1072.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-gcp - 5.4.0-1115.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gcp - 5.15.0-1044.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gkeop - 5.4.0-1078.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gkeop - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic-64k - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-ibm - 5.4.0-1058.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-ibm - 5.15.0-1040.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-kvm - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-oracle - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-oracle - 5.15.0-1045.51~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1095-raspi - 5.4.0-1095.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-5.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-lowlatency - 5.4.0-164.181\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-aws - 5.4.0-1111.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1047-aws - 5.15.0-1047.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-azure - 5.4.0-1117.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1049-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1049.56~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-bluefield - 5.4.0-1072.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-gcp - 5.4.0-1115.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-gcp - 5.15.0-1044.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gkeop - 5.4.0-1078.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gkeop - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-86-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-generic-64k - 5.15.0-86.96~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-ibm - 5.4.0-1058.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-ibm - 5.15.0-1040.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1043.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-iot - 5.4.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-kvm - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-86-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-86.95~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-oracle - 5.4.0-1110.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-oracle - 5.15.0-1045.51~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1031-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required",
