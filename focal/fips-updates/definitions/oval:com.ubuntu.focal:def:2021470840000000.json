		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hamradio: defer ax25 kfree after unregister_netdevThere is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below (USE)                       |  (FREE)ax25_sendmsg                 | ax25_queue_xmit             |  dev_queue_xmit             |   __dev_queue_xmit          |    __dev_xmit_skb           |     sch_direct_xmit         | ...      xmit_one               |       netdev_start_xmit     | tty_ldisc_kill        __netdev_start_xmit  |  mkiss_close         ax_xmit             |   kfree          ax_encaps          |                             |Even though there are two synchronization primitives before the kfree:1. wait_for_completion(&ax->dead). This can prevent the race withroutines from mkiss_ioctl. However, it cannot stop the routine comingfrom upper layer, i.e., the ax25_sendmsg.2. netif_stop_queue(ax->dev). It seems that this line of code aims tohalt the transmit queue but it fails to stop the routine that alreadybeing xmit.This patch reorder the kfree after the unregister_netdev to avoid thepossible UAF as the unregister_netdev() is well synchronized and won'treturn if there is a running routine.",
