		"title": "CVE-2024-40945 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu: Return right value in iommu_sva_bind_device()iommu_sva_bind_device() should return either a sva bond handle or anERR_PTR value in error cases. Existing drivers (idxd and uacce) onlycheck the return value with IS_ERR(). This could potentially lead toa kernel NULL pointer dereference issue if the function returns NULLinstead of an error pointer.In reality, this doesn't cause any problems because iommu_sva_bind_device()only returns NULL when the kernel is not configured with CONFIG_IOMMU_SVA.In this case, iommu_dev_enable_feature(dev, IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_SVA) willreturn an error, and the device drivers won't call iommu_sva_bind_device()at all.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40945` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-195-generic - 5.4.0-195.215\nlinux-image-5.4.0-195-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-195.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-generic - 5.4.0-195.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-lowlatency - 5.4.0-195.215\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1120-kvm - 5.4.0-1120.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-aws - 5.4.0-1132.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1137-azure - 5.4.0-1137.144\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-bluefield - 5.4.0-1092.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1136-gcp - 5.4.0-1136.145\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-gkeop - 5.4.0-1099.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-ibm - 5.4.0-1079.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1131-oracle - 5.4.0-1131.140\nNo subscription required",
