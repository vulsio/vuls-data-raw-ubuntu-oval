		"Title": "CVE-2022-3640 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Linux Kernel. Affected is the function l2cap_conn_del of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211944. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth stack in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3640` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-aws - 5.15.0-1030.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-azure - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1103.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-bluefield - 5.4.0-1058.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gcp - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-gke - 5.4.0-1094.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-gkeop - 5.4.0-1064.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-kvm - 5.4.0-1086.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-oracle - 5.15.0-1029.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1080-raspi - 5.4.0-1080.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-aws - 5.15.0-1030.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-azure - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1103.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1033.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-bluefield - 5.4.0-1058.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-gcp - 5.15.0-1029.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-gke - 5.4.0-1094.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-gkeop - 5.4.0-1064.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-60-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-generic-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1025-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-kvm - 5.4.0-1086.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-60-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-60.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1029-oracle - 5.15.0-1029.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
