		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Iftcf_change_indev() fails, u32_set_parms() will immediately return an errorafter incrementing or decrementing the reference counter intcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can control the reference counter and setit to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to ause-after-free vulnerability.
