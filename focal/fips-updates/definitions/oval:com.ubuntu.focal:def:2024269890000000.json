Such MEMBLOCK_NOMAP regionsshould not be saved during hibernation. This problem was introduced bychanges to the pfn_valid() logic in commit a7d9f306ba70 (\"arm64: droppfn_valid_within() and simplify pfn_valid()\"). Similar to otherarchitectures, drop the !can_set_direct_map() check inkernel_page_present() so that page_is_savable() skips such pages.[catalin.marinas@arm.com: rework commit message]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26989` to fix the vulnerability.
