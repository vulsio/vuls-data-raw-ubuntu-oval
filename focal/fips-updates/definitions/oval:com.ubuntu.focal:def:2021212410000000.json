		"description": "The Python \"Flask-Security-Too\" package is used for adding securityfeatures to your Flask application. It is an is a independently maintainedversion of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. InFlask-Security-Too from version 3.3.0 and before version 3.4.5, the /loginand /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authenticationtoken in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protectedwith a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiringthe authentication token. Version 3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are patched. As aworkaround, if you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set theSECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to \"0\" (seconds) which should make the tokenunusable.",
