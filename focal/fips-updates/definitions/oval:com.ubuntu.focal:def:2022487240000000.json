		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Fix potential memory leak in intel_setup_irq_remapping() Aftercommit e3beca48a45b (\"irqdomain/treewide: Keep firmware nodeunconditionally allocated\"). For tear down scenario, fn is only freed afterfail to allocate ir_domain, though it also should be freed in casedmar_enable_qi returns error. Besides free fn, irq_domain and ir_msi_domainneed to be removed as well if intel_setup_irq_remapping fails to enablequeued invalidation. Improve the rewinding path by add out_free_ir_domainand out_free_fwnode lables per Baolu's suggestion.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48724` to fix the vulnerability.
