    "Title": "CVE-2023-4387 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in VMware's vmxnet3 ethernet NIC driver in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a double-free while cleaning up vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all, which could also lead to a kernel information leak problem. It was discovered that the VMware VMXNET3 ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability in certain situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4387` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-aws - 5.15.0-1019.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-bluefield - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gcp - 5.15.0-1017.23~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gkeop - 5.4.0-1053.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-gkeop - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-ibm - 5.15.0-1033.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1004-iot - 5.4.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-kvm - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-oracle - 5.15.0-1017.22~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1070-raspi - 5.4.0-1070.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-aws - 5.15.0-1019.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-bluefield - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-gcp - 5.15.0-1017.23~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gkeop - 5.4.0-1053.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-gkeop - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-ibm - 5.15.0-1033.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1004-iot - 5.4.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-kvm - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-oracle - 5.15.0-1017.22~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1020-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1020.24\nNo subscription required",
