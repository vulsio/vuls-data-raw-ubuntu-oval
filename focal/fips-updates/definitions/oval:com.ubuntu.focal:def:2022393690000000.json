		"description": "phpCAS is an authentication library that allows PHP applications to easilyauthenticate users via a Central Authentication Service (CAS) server. ThephpCAS library uses HTTP headers to determine the service URL used tovalidate tickets. This allows an attacker to control the host header anduse a valid ticket granted for any authorized service in the same SSO realm(CAS server) to authenticate to the service protected by phpCAS. Dependingon the settings of the CAS server service registry in worst case this maybe any other service URL (if the allowed URLs are configured to\"^(https)://.*\") or may be strictly limited to known and authorizedservices in the same SSO federation if proper URL service validation isapplied. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain access to avictim's account on a vulnerable CASified service without victim'sknowledge, when the victim visits attacker's website while being logged into the same CAS server. phpCAS 1.6.0 is a major version upgrade that startsenforcing service URL discovery validation, because there is unfortunatelyno 100% safe default config to use in PHP. Starting this version, it isrequired to pass in an additional service base URL argument whenconstructing the client class. For more information, please refer to theupgrading doc. This vulnerability only impacts the CAS client that thephpCAS library protects against. The problematic service URL discoverybehavior in phpCAS < 1.6.0 will only be disabled, and thus you are notimpacted from it, if the phpCAS configuration has the following setup: 1.`phpCAS::setUrl()` is called (a reminder that you have to pass in the fullURL of the current page, rather than your service base URL), and 2.`phpCAS::setCallbackURL()` is called, only when the proxy mode is enabled.3. If your PHP's HTTP header input `X-Forwarded-Host`,`X-Forwarded-Server`, `Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Protocol`is sanitized before reaching PHP (by a reverse proxy, for example), youwill not be impacted by this vulnerability either. If your CAS serverservice registry is configured to only allow known and trusted service URLsthe severity of the vulnerability is reduced substantially in its severitysince an attacker must be in control of another authorized service.Otherwise, you should upgrade the library to get the safe service discoverybehavior.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39369` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphp-cas - 1.3.8-1ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
