Yet, it can occurto SMMU too, since arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs() is calledtypically next to MMU tlb flush function, e.g.\ttlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly {\t\ttlb_flush {\t\t\t__flush_tlb_range {\t\t\t\t// check MAX_TLBI_OPS\t\t\t}\t\t}\t\tmmu_notifier_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {\t\t\tarm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {\t\t\t\t// does not check MAX_TLBI_OPS\t\t\t}\t\t}\t}Clone a CMDQ_MAX_TLBI_OPS from the MAX_TLBI_OPS in tlbflush.h, since in anSVA case SMMU uses the CPU page table, so it makes sense to align with thetlbflush code. Then, replace per-page TLBI commands with a single per-asidTLBI command, if the request size hits this threshold.",
