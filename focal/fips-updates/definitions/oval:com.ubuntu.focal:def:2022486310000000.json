		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:fix bug in extents parsing when eh_entries == 0 and eh_depth > 0 Whenwalking through an inode extents, the ext4_ext_binsearch_idx() functionassumes that the extent header has been previously validated. However,there are no checks that verify that the number of entries (eh->eh_entries)is non-zero when depth is > 0. And this will lead to problems because theEXT_FIRST_INDEX() and EXT_LAST_INDEX() will return garbage and result inthis: [ 135.245946] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 135.247579]kernel BUG at fs/ext4/extents.c:2258!
