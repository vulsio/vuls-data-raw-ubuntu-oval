		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usage The below race isobserved on a PFN which falls into the device memory region with the systemmemory configuration where PFN's are such that [ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICEZONE_NORMAL]. Since normal zone start and end pfn contains the devicememory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered will try on the devicememory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because pfn_to_online_page()returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections). When from other core, thesection mappings are being removed for the ZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFNin question belongs to, on which compaction is currently being operated isresulting into the kernel crash with CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled. Thecrash logs can be seen at [1]. compact_zone() memunmap_pages ---------------------------- __pageblock_pfn_to_page ...... (a)pfn_valid():valid_section()//return true (b)__remove_pages()->sparse_remove_section()-> section_deactivate(): [Free the array ms->usageand set ms->usage = NULL] pfn_section_valid() [Access ms->usage which isNULL] NOTE: From the above it can be said that the race is reduced tobetween the pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the section deactivate withSPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled. The commit b943f045a9af(\"mm/sparse: fix kernelcrash with pfn_section_valid check\") tried to address the same problem byclearing the SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section()returns false thus ms->usage is not accessed. Fix this issue by the belowsteps: a) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the ->usage. b) RCUprotected read side critical section will either return NULL whenSECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage. c) Freethe ->usage with kfree_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL. No attempt will bemade to access ->usage after this as the SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is clearedthus valid_section() return false. Thanks to David/Pavan for their inputson this patch. [1]https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/994410bb-89aa-d987-1f50-f514903c55aa@quicinc.com/On Snapdragon SoC, with the mentioned memory configuration of PFN's as[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL], we are able to see bunch of issuesdaily while testing on a device farm. For this particular issue below isthe log. Though the below log is not directly pointing to thepfn_section_valid(){ ms->usage;}, when we loaded this dump on T32lauterbach tool, it is pointing.
