		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm-raid456, md/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrentwith reshape For raid456, if reshape is still in progress, then IO acrossreshape position will wait for reshape to make progress. However, fordm-raid, in following cases reshape will never make progress hence IO willhang: 1) the array is read-only; 2) MD_RECOVERY_WAIT is set; 3)MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set; After commit c467e97f079f (\"md/raid6: use validsector values to determine if an I/O should wait on the reshape\") fix theproblem that IO across reshape position doesn't wait for reshape, thedm-raid test shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang: [root@fedora~]# cat /proc/979/stack [<0>] wait_woken+0x7d/0x90 [<0>]raid5_make_request+0x929/0x1d70 [raid456] [<0>]md_handle_request+0xc2/0x3b0 [md_mod] [<0>] raid_map+0x2c/0x50 [dm_raid][<0>] __map_bio+0x251/0x380 [dm_mod] [<0>] dm_submit_bio+0x1f0/0x760[dm_mod] [<0>] __submit_bio+0xc2/0x1c0 [<0>]submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x17f/0x450 [<0>] submit_bio_noacct+0x2bc/0x780[<0>] submit_bio+0x70/0xc0 [<0>] mpage_readahead+0x169/0x1f0 [<0>]blkdev_readahead+0x18/0x30 [<0>] read_pages+0x7c/0x3b0 [<0>]page_cache_ra_unbounded+0x1ab/0x280 [<0>] force_page_cache_ra+0x9e/0x130[<0>] page_cache_sync_ra+0x3b/0x110 [<0>] filemap_get_pages+0x143/0xa30[<0>] filemap_read+0xdc/0x4b0 [<0>] blkdev_read_iter+0x75/0x200 [<0>]vfs_read+0x272/0x460 [<0>] ksys_read+0x7a/0x170 [<0>]__x64_sys_read+0x1c/0x30 [<0>] do_syscall_64+0xc6/0x230 [<0>]entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6c/0x74 This is because reshape can't makeprogress. For md/raid, the problem doesn't exist because register newsync_thread doesn't rely on the IO to be done any more: 1) If array isread-only, it can switch to read-write by ioctl/sysfs; 2) md/raid never setMD_RECOVERY_WAIT; 3) If MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set, mddev_suspend() doesn'thold 'reconfig_mutex', hence it can be cleared and reshape can continue bysysfs api 'sync_action'. However, I'm not sure yet how to avoid the problemin dm-raid yet. This patch on the one hand make sure raid_message() can'tchange sync_thread() through raid_message() after presuspend(), on theother hand detect the above 3 cases before wait for IO do be done indm_suspend(), and let dm-raid requeue those IO.",
