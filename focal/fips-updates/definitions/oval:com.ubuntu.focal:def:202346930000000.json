		"Title": "CVE-2023-4693 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found on grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue may allow a physically present attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS file system image to read arbitrary memory locations. A successful attack allows sensitive data cached in memory or EFI variable values to be leaked, presenting a high Confidentiality risk. It was discovered that a specially crafted file system image could cause an out-of-bounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to leak sensitive information to the GRUB pager.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4693` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.187.6~20.04.1\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.187.6~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.4\nNo subscription required",
