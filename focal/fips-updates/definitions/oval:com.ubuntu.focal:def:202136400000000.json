    "Title": "CVE-2021-3640 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del() together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3640` to fix the vulnerability.
