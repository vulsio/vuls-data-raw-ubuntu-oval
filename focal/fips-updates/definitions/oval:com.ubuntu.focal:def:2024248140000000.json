		"description": "mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certifiedâ„¢ authentication and authorizationmodule for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID ConnectRelying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validationon mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerableto a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has beenconducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of themod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finallygets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused ourserver to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would makethe server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crashwith minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2.Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for thisvulnerability.",
