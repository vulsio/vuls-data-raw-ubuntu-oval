		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix possible store tearing in neigh_periodic_work() While looking at arelated syzbot report involving neigh_periodic_work(), I found that Iforgot to add an annotation when deleting an RCU protected item from alist. Readers use rcu_deference(*np), we need to use eitherrcu_assign_pointer() or WRITE_ONCE() on writer side to prevent storetearing. I use rcu_assign_pointer() to have lockdep support, this was thechoice made in neigh_flush_dev().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52522` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1056-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1056.64~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-fips - 5.4.0-1092.102\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1092-fips - 5.4.0-1092.102\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1118-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1118.128+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1118-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1118.128+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1123-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1123.130+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1123-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1123.130+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1122-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1122.131+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1122-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1122.131+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
