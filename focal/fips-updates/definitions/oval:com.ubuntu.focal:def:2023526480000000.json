		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Unmap the surface before resetting it on a plane state Switchto a new plane state requires unreferencing of all held surfaces. In thework required for mob cursors the mapped surfaces started being cached butthe variable indicating whether the surface is currently mapped was notbeing reset. This leads to crashes as the duplicated state, incorrectly,indicates the that surface is mapped even when no surface is present.That's because after unreferencing the surface it's perfectly possible forthe plane to be backed by a bo instead of a surface. Reset the surfacemapped flag when unreferencing the plane state surface to fix null derefsin cleanup.
