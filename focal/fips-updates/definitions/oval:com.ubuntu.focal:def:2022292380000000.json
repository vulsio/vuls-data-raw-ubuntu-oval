		"Title": "CVE-2022-29238 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactivecomputing. Prior to version 6.4.12, authenticated requests to the notebookserver with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listingthe contents of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden filesor files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowingauthenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to bedisallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are required, this is ofrelatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitivefiles whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh`while serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files iftheir names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full accessto the server and therefore execution permissions, which also generallygrants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result inany privilege escalation or increase in information access, only anadditional, unintended means by which the files could be accessed. Version6.4.12 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no knownworkarounds.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29238` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njupyter-notebook - 6.0.3-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-notebook - 6.0.3-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
