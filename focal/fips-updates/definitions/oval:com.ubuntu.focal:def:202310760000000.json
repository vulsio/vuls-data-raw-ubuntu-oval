		"title": "CVE-2023-1076 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socketUID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initializationfunction. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices requireCAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user onlyhaving that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectlytreated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1076` to fix the vulnerability.
