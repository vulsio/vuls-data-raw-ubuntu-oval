		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/mm:Disallow vsyscall page read for copy_from_kernel_nofault() When trying touse copy_from_kernel_nofault() to read vsyscall page through a bpf program,the following oops was reported: BUG: unable to handle page fault foraddress: ffffffffff600000 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode #PF:error_code(0x0000) - not-present page PGD 3231067 P4D 3231067 PUD 3233067PMD 3235067 PTE 0 Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI CPU: 1 PID: 20390 Comm:test_progs ...... 6.7.0+ #58 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX +PIIX, 1996) ......

This results in the fix-up setup by bpf not being applied and apage_fault_oops() is invoked due to SMAP. Considering handle_page_fault()has already considered the vsyscall page address as a userspace address,fix the problem by disallowing vsyscall page read forcopy_from_kernel_nofault().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26906` to fix the vulnerability.
