		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/iova: Fix alloc iova overflows issueIn __alloc_and_insert_iova_range, there is an issue that retry_pfnoverflows. The value of iovad->anchor.pfn_hi is ~0UL, then wheniovad->cached_node is iovad->anchor, curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1 willoverflow. As a result, if the retry logic is executed, low_pfn isupdated to 0, and then new_pfn < low_pfn returns false to make theallocation successful.This issue occurs in the following two situations:1. The first iova size exceeds the domain size. When initializingiova domain, iovad->cached_node is assigned as iovad->anchor. Forexample, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,and the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. Thefollowing is the log information, new->pfn_lo is smaller thaniovad->cached_node.Example log as follows:[  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_rangestart_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00[  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_rangesuccess start_pfn:0x1f0000,new->pfn_lo:0x1efe00,new->pfn_hi:0x1f08ff2. The node with the largest iova->pfn_lo value in the iova domainis deleted, iovad->cached_node will be updated to iovad->anchor,and then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that canbe allocated in the domain.After judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1to fix the overflow issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52910` to fix the vulnerability.
