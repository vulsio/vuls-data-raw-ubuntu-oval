		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bnxt_en: Fix RX consumer index logic in the error path. In bnxt_rx_pkt(),the RX buffers are expected to complete in order. If the RX consumer indexindicates an out of order buffer completion, it means we are hitting ahardware bug and the driver will abort all remaining RX packets and resetthe RX ring. The RX consumer index that we pass to bnxt_discard_rx() is notcorrect. We should be passing the current index (tmp_raw_cons) instead ofthe old index (raw_cons). This bug can cause us to be at the wrong indexwhen trying to abort the next RX packet. It can crash like this: #0[ffff9bbcdf5c39a8] machine_kexec at ffffffff9b05e007 #1 [ffff9bbcdf5c3a00]__crash_kexec at ffffffff9b111232 #2 [ffff9bbcdf5c3ad0] panic atffffffff9b07d61e #3 [ffff9bbcdf5c3b50] oops_end at ffffffff9b030978 #4[ffff9bbcdf5c3b78] no_context at ffffffff9b06aaf0 #5 [ffff9bbcdf5c3bd8]__bad_area_nosemaphore at ffffffff9b06ae2e #6 [ffff9bbcdf5c3c28]bad_area_nosemaphore at ffffffff9b06af24 #7 [ffff9bbcdf5c3c38]__do_page_fault at ffffffff9b06b67e #8 [ffff9bbcdf5c3cb0] do_page_fault atffffffff9b06bb12 #9 [ffff9bbcdf5c3ce0] page_fault at ffffffff9bc015c5[exception RIP: bnxt_rx_pkt+237] RIP: ffffffffc0259cdd RSP:ffff9bbcdf5c3d98 RFLAGS: 00010213 RAX: 000000005dd8097f RBX:ffff9ba4cb11b7e0 RCX: ffffa923cf6e9000 RDX: 0000000000000fff RSI:0000000000000627 RDI: 0000000000001000 RBP: ffff9bbcdf5c3e60 R8:0000000000420003 R9: 000000000000020d R10: ffffa923cf6ec138 R11:ffff9bbcdf5c3e83 R12: ffff9ba4d6f928c0 R13: ffff9ba4cac28080 R14:ffff9ba4cb11b7f0 R15: ffff9ba4d5a30000 ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff CS: 0010SS: 0018",
