		"Title": "CVE-2023-2008 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's udmabuf device driver. The specific flaw exists within a fault handler. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2008` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-aws - 5.15.0-1020.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-azure - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-bluefield - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-gcp - 5.15.0-1018.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-gke - 5.4.0-1083.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gke - 5.15.0-1016.19~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gkeop - 5.4.0-1053.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1016.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-kvm - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-oracle - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1070-raspi - 5.4.0-1070.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-aws - 5.15.0-1020.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1020-azure - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1020.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-bluefield - 5.4.0-1046.51\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-gcp - 5.15.0-1018.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-gke - 5.4.0-1083.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gke - 5.15.0-1016.19~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gkeop - 5.4.0-1053.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-generic-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1016.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-kvm - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-48-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-48.54~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-oracle - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
