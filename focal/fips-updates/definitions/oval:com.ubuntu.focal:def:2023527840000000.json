		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bonding: stop the device in bond_setup_by_slave() Commit 9eed321cde22(\"net: lapbether: only support ethernet devices\") has been able to keepsyzbot away from net/lapb, until today. In the following splat [1], theissue is that a lapbether device has been created on a bonding devicewithout members. Then adding a non ARPHRD_ETHER member forced the bondingmaster to change its type. The fix is to make sure we call dev_close() inbond_setup_by_slave() so that the potential linked lapbether devices (orany other devices having assumptions on the physical device) are removed. Asimilar bug has been addressed in commit 40baec225765 (\"bonding: fix panicon non-ARPHRD_ETHER enslave failure\") [1] skbuff: skb_under_panic:text:ffff800089508810 len:44 put:40 head:ffff0000c78e7c00data:ffff0000c78e7bea tail:0x16 end:0x140 dev:bond0 kernel BUG atnet/core/skbuff.c:192 !
