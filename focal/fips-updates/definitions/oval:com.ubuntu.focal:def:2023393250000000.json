		"description": "A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediatelyresets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While thetotal number of requests is bounded by thehttp2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress requestallows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is stillexecuting. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number ofsimultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit(MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which canonly happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) willbe queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, theserver will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed ingolang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The defaultstream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection.This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; seethe Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39325` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngolang-1.20 - 1.20.3-1ubuntu0.1~20.04.1\ngolang-1.20-go - 1.20.3-1ubuntu0.1~20.04.1\ngolang-1.20-src - 1.20.3-1ubuntu0.1~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
