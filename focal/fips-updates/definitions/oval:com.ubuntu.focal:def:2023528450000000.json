This causes theabove issue. This patch changes the nla_policy for bearer-related namesfrom NLA_STRING to NLA_NUL_STRING. This resolves the issue by ensuring thatonly null-terminated strings are accepted as bearer-related names. syzbotreported similar uninit-value issue related to bearer names [2]. The rootcause of this issue is that a non-null-terminated bearer name was passed.This patch also resolved this issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52845` to fix the vulnerability.
