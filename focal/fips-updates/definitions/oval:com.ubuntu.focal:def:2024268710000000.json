It is possible that otherthreads have added this fio to io->bio and submitted the io->bio beforeentering f2fs_submit_page_write(). At this point io->bio = NULL. Ifis_end_zone_blkaddr(sbi, fio->new_blkaddr) of this fio is true, then anNULL pointer dereference error occurs at bio_get(io->bio). The originalcode for determining zone end was after \"out:\", which would have missedsome fio who is zone end. I've moved this code before \"skip:\" to make sureit's done for each fio.",
