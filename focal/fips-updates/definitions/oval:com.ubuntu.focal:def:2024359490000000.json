		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: make sure that WRITTEN is set on all metadata blocksWe previously would call btrfs_check_leaf() if we had the checkintegrity code enabled, which meant that we could only run the extendedleaf checks if we had WRITTEN set on the header flags.This leaves a gap in our checking, because we could end up withcorruption on disk where WRITTEN isn't set on the leaf, and then theextended leaf checks don't get run which we rely on to validate all ofthe item pointers to make sure we don't access memory outside of theextent buffer.However, since 732fab95abe2 (\"btrfs: check-integrity: removeCONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY option\") we no longer callbtrfs_check_leaf() from btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty(), which means we onlyever call it on blocks that are being written out, and thus have WRITTENset, or that are being read in, which should have WRITTEN set.Add checks to make sure we have WRITTEN set appropriately, and then makesure __btrfs_check_leaf() always does the item checking.  This willprotect us from file systems that have been corrupted and no longer haveWRITTEN set on some of the blocks.This was hit on a crafted image tweaking the WRITTEN bit and reported byKASAN as out-of-bound access in the eb accessors. The example is a diritem at the end of an eb.
