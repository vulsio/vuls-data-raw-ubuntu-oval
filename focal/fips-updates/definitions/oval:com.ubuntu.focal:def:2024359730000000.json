		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:geneve: fix header validation in geneve[6]_xmit_skbsyzbot is able to trigger an uninit-value in geneve_xmit() [1]Problem : While most ip tunnel helpers (like ip_tunnel_get_dsfield())uses skb_protocol(skb, true), pskb_inet_may_pull() is only usingskb->protocol.If anything else than ETH_P_IPV6 or ETH_P_IP is found in skb->protocol,pskb_inet_may_pull() does nothing at all.If a vlan tag was provided by the caller (af_packet in the syzbot case),the network header might not point to the correct location, and skblinear part could be smaller than expected.Add skb_vlan_inet_prepare() to perform a complete mac validation.Use this in geneve for the moment, I suspect we need to adopt thismore broadly.v4 - Jakub reported v3 broke l2_tos_ttl_inherit.sh selftest   - Only call __vlan_get_protocol() for vlan types.v2,v3 - Addressed Sabrina comments on v1 and v2[1]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in geneve_xmit_skb drivers/net/geneve.c:910[inline] BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in geneve_xmit+0x302d/0x5420drivers/net/geneve.c:1030  geneve_xmit_skb drivers/net/geneve.c:910 [inline]  geneve_xmit+0x302d/0x5420 drivers/net/geneve.c:1030  __netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:4903 [inline]  netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:4917 [inline]  xmit_one net/core/dev.c:3531 [inline]  dev_hard_start_xmit+0x247/0xa20 net/core/dev.c:3547  __dev_queue_xmit+0x348d/0x52c0 net/core/dev.c:4335  dev_queue_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:3091 [inline]  packet_xmit+0x9c/0x6c0 net/packet/af_packet.c:276  packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3081 [inline]  packet_sendmsg+0x8bb0/0x9ef0 net/packet/af_packet.c:3113  sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline]  __sock_sendmsg+0x30f/0x380 net/socket.c:745  __sys_sendto+0x685/0x830 net/socket.c:2191  __do_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2203 [inline]  __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2199 [inline]  __x64_sys_sendto+0x125/0x1d0 net/socket.c:2199 do_syscall_64+0xd5/0x1f0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6d/0x75Uninit was created at:  slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:3804 [inline]  slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:3845 [inline]  kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x613/0xc50 mm/slub.c:3888  kmalloc_reserve+0x13d/0x4a0 net/core/skbuff.c:577  __alloc_skb+0x35b/0x7a0 net/core/skbuff.c:668  alloc_skb include/linux/skbuff.h:1318 [inline]  alloc_skb_with_frags+0xc8/0xbf0 net/core/skbuff.c:6504  sock_alloc_send_pskb+0xa81/0xbf0 net/core/sock.c:2795  packet_alloc_skb net/packet/af_packet.c:2930 [inline]  packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3024 [inline]  packet_sendmsg+0x722d/0x9ef0 net/packet/af_packet.c:3113  sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline]  __sock_sendmsg+0x30f/0x380 net/socket.c:745  __sys_sendto+0x685/0x830 net/socket.c:2191  __do_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2203 [inline]  __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2199 [inline]  __x64_sys_sendto+0x125/0x1d0 net/socket.c:2199 do_syscall_64+0xd5/0x1f0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6d/0x75CPU: 0 PID: 5033 Comm: syz-executor346 Not tainted6.9.0-rc1-syzkaller-00005-g928a87efa423 #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 02/29/2024",
