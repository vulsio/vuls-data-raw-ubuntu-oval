		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Fixpage corruption caused by racy check in __free_pages When we upgraded ourkernel, we started seeing some page corruption like the followingconsistently: BUG: Bad page state in process ganesha.nfsd pfn:1304capage:0000000022261c55 refcount:0 mapcount:-128 mapping:0000000000000000index:0x0 pfn:0x1304ca flags: 0x17ffffc0000000() raw: 0017ffffc0000000ffff8a513ffd4c98 ffffeee24b35ec08 0000000000000000 raw: 00000000000000000000000000000001 00000000ffffff7f 0000000000000000 page dumped because:nonzero mapcount CPU: 0 PID: 15567 Comm: ganesha.nfsd Kdump: loadedTainted: P B O 5.10.158-1.nutanix.20221209.el7.x86_64 #1 Hardware name:VMware, Inc.

Sometimes, it would also show up ascorruption in the free list pointer and cause crashes. After bisecting theissue, we found the issue started from commit e320d3012d25(\"mm/page_alloc.c: fix freeing non-compound pages\"): if(put_page_testzero(page)) free_the_page(page, order); else if(!PageHead(page)) while (order-- > 0) free_the_page(page + (1 << order),order); So the problem is the check PageHead is racy because at this pointwe already dropped our reference to the page. So even if we came in withcompound page, the page can already be freed and PageHead can return falseand we will end up freeing all the tail pages causing double free.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52739` to fix the vulnerability.
