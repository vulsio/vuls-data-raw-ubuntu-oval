Inversions of the sentry python library prior to 22.11.0 an attacker with aknown valid invite link could manipulate a cookie to allow the same invitelink to be reused on multiple accounts when joining an organization. As aresult an attacker with a valid invite link can create multiple users andjoin an organization they may not have been originally invited to. Thisissue was patched in version 22.11.0. Sentry SaaS customers do not need totake action. Self-hosted Sentry installs on systems which can not upgradecan disable the invite functionality until they are ready to deploy thepatched version by editing their `sentry.conf.py` file (usually located at`~/.sentry/`).",
