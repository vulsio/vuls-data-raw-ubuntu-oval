		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: hsr: remove WARN_ONCE() in send_hsr_supervision_frame()Syzkaller reported [1] hitting a warning after failing to allocateresources for skb in hsr_init_skb(). Since a WARN_ONCE() call willnot help much in this case, it might be prudent to switch tonetdev_warn_once(). At the very least it will suppress syzkallerreports such as [1].Just in case, use netdev_warn_once() in send_prp_supervision_frame()for similar reasons.[1]HSR: Could not send supervision frameWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 85 at net/hsr/hsr_device.c:294send_hsr_supervision_frame+0x60a/0x810 net/hsr/hsr_device.c:294RIP: 0010:send_hsr_supervision_frame+0x60a/0x810 net/hsr/hsr_device.c:294...Call Trace: <IRQ> hsr_announce+0x114/0x370 net/hsr/hsr_device.c:382 call_timer_fn+0x193/0x590 kernel/time/timer.c:1700 expire_timers kernel/time/timer.c:1751 [inline] __run_timers+0x764/0xb20 kernel/time/timer.c:2022 run_timer_softirq+0x58/0xd0 kernel/time/timer.c:2035 __do_softirq+0x21a/0x8de kernel/softirq.c:553 invoke_softirq kernel/softirq.c:427 [inline] __irq_exit_rcu kernel/softirq.c:632 [inline] irq_exit_rcu+0xb7/0x120 kernel/softirq.c:644 sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x95/0xb0 arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1076 </IRQ> <TASK> asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x1a/0x20arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:649...This issue is also found in older kernels (at least up to 5.10).",
