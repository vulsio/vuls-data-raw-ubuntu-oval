    "Title": "CVE-2022-33740 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742). Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33740` to fix the vulnerability.
