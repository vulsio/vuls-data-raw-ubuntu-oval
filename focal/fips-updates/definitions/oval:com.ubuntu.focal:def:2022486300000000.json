		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ The commitreferenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else branch inqcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is not a multipleof WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running: kcapi-rng -b 67>/dev/null There are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break',but they all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.Tested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48630` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-gkeop - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-ibm - 5.15.0-1033.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-iot - 5.4.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1020-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1020.24\nNo subscription required",
