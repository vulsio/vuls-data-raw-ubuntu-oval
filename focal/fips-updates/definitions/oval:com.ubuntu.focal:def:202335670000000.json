		"Title": "CVE-2023-3567 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in vcs_read in drivers/tty/vt/vc_screen.c in vc_screen in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow an attacker with local user access to cause a system crash or leak internal kernel information. It was discovered that the virtual terminal driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3567` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-149.166\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-generic -
