However, the driver's stop() method will only executeif networking interface configuration logic within the Linux distributionhas been setup to do so. If shutdown() executes but stop() does notexecute, NAPI remains enabled and this can lead to an exception if NAPI isscheduled while the hardware interface has only been partiallydeinitialized. The networking interface managed by the mlxbf_gige drivermust be properly stopped during system shutdown so that IFF_UP is cleared,the hardware interface is put into a clean state, and NAPI is fullydeinitialized.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35885` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1068-azure - 5.15.0-1068.77~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1048-gkeop - 5.15.0-1048.55~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1060-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1060.66~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
