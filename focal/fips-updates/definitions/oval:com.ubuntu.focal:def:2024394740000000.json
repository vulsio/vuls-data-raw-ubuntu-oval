		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/vmalloc: fix vmalloc which may return null if called with __GFP_NOFAILcommit a421ef303008 (\"mm: allow !GFP_KERNEL allocations for kvmalloc\")includes support for __GFP_NOFAIL, but it presents a conflict with commitdd544141b9eb (\"vmalloc: back off when the current task is OOM-killed\").  Apossible scenario is as follows:process-a__vmalloc_node_range(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOFAIL)    __vmalloc_area_node()        vm_area_alloc_pages()\t\t--> oom-killer send SIGKILL to process-a        if (fatal_signal_pending(current)) break;--> return NULL;To fix this, do not check fatal_signal_pending() in vm_area_alloc_pages()if __GFP_NOFAIL set.This issue occurred during OPLUS KASAN TEST.
