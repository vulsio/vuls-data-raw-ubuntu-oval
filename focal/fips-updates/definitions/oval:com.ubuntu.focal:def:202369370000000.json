		"description": "wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6 did not check that messages in one (D)TLS record donot span key boundaries. As a result, it was possible to combine (D)TLSmessages using different keys into one (D)TLS record. The most extreme edgecase is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3record from the server containing first a ServerHello message and then therest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In(D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSLclient would accept an unencrypted flight from the server. This does notcompromise key negotiation and authentication so it is assigned a lowseverity rating.",
