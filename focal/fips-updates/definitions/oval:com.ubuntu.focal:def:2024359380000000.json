		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:ath11k: decrease MHI channel buffer length to 8KB Currently buf_len fieldof ath11k_mhi_config_qca6390 is assigned with 0, making MHI use a defaultsize, 64KB, to allocate channel buffers. This is likely to fail in somescenarios where system memory is highly fragmented and memory compaction orreclaim is not allowed. There is a fail report which is caused by it:kworker/u32:45: page allocation failure: order:4,mode:0x40c00(GFP_NOIO|__GFP_COMP), nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0CPU: 0 PID: 19318 Comm: kworker/u32:45 Not tainted6.8.0-rc3-1.gae4495f-default #1 openSUSE Tumbleweed (unreleased)493b6d5b382c603654d7a81fc3c144d59a1dfceb Workqueue: events_unboundasync_run_entry_fn Call Trace: <TASK> dump_stack_lvl+0x47/0x60warn_alloc+0x13a/0x1b0 ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5 ?__alloc_pages_direct_compact+0xab/0x210__alloc_pages_slowpath.constprop.0+0xd3e/0xda0 __alloc_pages+0x32d/0x350 ?mhi_prepare_channel+0x127/0x2d0 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] __kmalloc_large_node+0x72/0x110__kmalloc+0x37c/0x480 ? mhi_map_single_no_bb+0x77/0xf0 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] ? mhi_prepare_channel+0x127/0x2d0[mhi 40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814]mhi_prepare_channel+0x127/0x2d0 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814]__mhi_prepare_for_transfer+0x44/0x80 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] ?__pfx_____mhi_prepare_for_transfer+0x10/0x10 [mhi40df44e07c05479f7a6e7b90fba9f0e0031a7814] device_for_each_child+0x5c/0xa0 ?__pfx_pci_pm_resume+0x10/0x10 ath11k_core_resume+0x65/0x100 [ath11ka5094e22d7223135c40d93c8f5321cf09fd85e4e] ?srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5 ath11k_pci_pm_resume+0x32/0x60[ath11k_pci 830b7bfc3ea80ebef32e563cafe2cb55e9cc73ec] ?srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5 dpm_run_callback+0x8c/0x1e0device_resume+0x104/0x340 ? __pfx_dpm_watchdog_handler+0x10/0x10async_resume+0x1d/0x30 async_run_entry_fn+0x32/0x120process_one_work+0x168/0x330 worker_thread+0x2f5/0x410 ?__pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10 kthread+0xe8/0x120 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10ret_from_fork+0x34/0x50 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 </TASK> Actually those buffers are used only byQMI target -> host communication. And for WCN6855 and QCA6390, the largestpacket size for that is less than 6KB. So change buf_len field to 8KB,which results in order 1 allocation if page size is 4KB. In this way, wecan at least save some memory, and as well as decrease the possibility ofallocation failure in those scenarios.
