		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:Always flush async #PF workqueue when vCPU is being destroyed Always flushthe per-vCPU async #PF workqueue when a vCPU is clearing its completionqueue, e.g. when a VM and all its vCPUs is being destroyed. KVM must ensurethat none of its workqueue callbacks is running when the last reference tothe KVM _module_ is put. Gifting a reference to the associated VM preventsthe workqueue callback from dereferencing freed vCPU/VM memory, but doesnot prevent the KVM module from being unloaded before the callbackcompletes. Drop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm()from async_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueuewill result in deadlock. async_pf_execute() can't return untilkvm_put_kvm() finishes, and kvm_put_kvm() can't return untilasync_pf_execute() finishes: WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 251 atvirt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1435 kvm_put_kvm+0x2d/0x320 [kvm] Modules linked in:vhost_net vhost vhost_iotlb tap kvm_intel kvm irqbypass CPU: 8 PID: 251Comm: kworker/8:1 Tainted: G W 6.6.0-rc1-e7af8d17224a-x86/gmem-vm #119Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015Workqueue: events async_pf_execute [kvm] RIP: 0010:kvm_put_kvm+0x2d/0x320[kvm] Call Trace: <TASK> async_pf_execute+0x198/0x260 [kvm]process_one_work+0x145/0x2d0 worker_thread+0x27e/0x3a0 kthread+0xba/0xe0ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50 ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20 </TASK> ---[ end trace0000000000000000 ]--- INFO: task kworker/8:1:251 blocked for more than 120seconds.

And that in turn fixes the moduleunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU referenceuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts thelast reference to the KVM module. Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion()may also take the work item off the completion queue and so also needs toflush the work queue, as the work will not be seen bykvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue(). Waiting on the workqueue couldtheoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the work to complete, butthat's a very, very small chance, and likely a very small delay.kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a new request,i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the remaining work isreally just: trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);__kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu); mmput(mm); and mmput() can't drop the lastreference to the page tables if the vCPU is still alive, i.e. the vCPUwon't get stuck tearing down page tables. Add a helper to do the flushing,specifically to deal with \"wakeup all\" work items, as they aren't actuallywork items, i.e. are never placed in a workqueue. Trying to flush a bogusworkqueue entry rightly makes __flush_work() complain (kudos to whoeveradded that sanity check). Note, commit 5f6de5cbebee (\"KVM: Prevent moduleexit until al ---truncated---",
