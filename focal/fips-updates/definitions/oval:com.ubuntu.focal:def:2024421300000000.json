The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-121-generic - 5.15.0-121.131~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-121-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-121.131~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-121-generic - 5.15.0-121.131~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-121-generic-64k - 5.15.0-121.131~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1069-aws - 5.15.0-1069.75~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1068-gcp - 5.15.0-1068.76~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-gkeop - 5.15.0-1052.59~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1064-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1064.70~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
