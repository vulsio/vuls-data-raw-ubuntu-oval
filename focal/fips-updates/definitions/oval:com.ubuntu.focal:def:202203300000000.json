    "Title": "CVE-2022-0330 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0330` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-generic - 5.4.0-100.113\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-100.113\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-100-generic -
