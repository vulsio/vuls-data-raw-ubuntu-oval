		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: idxd: Convert spinlock to mutex to lock evl workqueuedrain_workqueue() cannot be called safely in a spinlocked context due topossible task rescheduling. In the multi-task scenario, callingqueue_work() while drain_workqueue() will lead to a Call Trace aspushing a work on a draining workqueue is not permitted in spinlockedcontext.    Call Trace:    <TASK>    ? __warn+0x7d/0x140    ? __queue_work+0x2b2/0x440    ? report_bug+0x1f8/0x200    ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70    ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70    ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20    ? __queue_work+0x2b2/0x440    queue_work_on+0x28/0x30    idxd_misc_thread+0x303/0x5a0 [idxd]    ? __schedule+0x369/0xb40    ? __pfx_irq_thread_fn+0x10/0x10    ? irq_thread+0xbc/0x1b0    irq_thread_fn+0x21/0x70    irq_thread+0x102/0x1b0    ? preempt_count_add+0x74/0xa0    ? __pfx_irq_thread_dtor+0x10/0x10    ? __pfx_irq_thread+0x10/0x10    kthread+0x103/0x140    ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10    ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50    ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10    ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30    </TASK>The current implementation uses a spinlock to protect event log workqueueand will lead to the Call Trace due to potential task rescheduling.To address the locking issue, convert the spinlock to mutex, allowingthe drain_workqueue() to be called in a safe mutex-locked context.This change ensures proper synchronization when accessing the event logworkqueue, preventing potential Call Trace and improving the overallrobustness of the code.",
