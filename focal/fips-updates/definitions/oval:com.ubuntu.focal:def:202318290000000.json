		"Title": "CVE-2023-1829 on Ubuntu 20.04 FIPS Compliant (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. We recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28. It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for the TCINDEX classifier has been removed.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1829` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-148.165\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-lowlatency - 5.4.0-148.165\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-aws - 5.4.0-1101.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-aws - 5.15.0-1035.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-azure - 5.4.0-1107.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-azure - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1107.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-bluefield - 5.4.0-1062.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-gcp - 5.4.0-1104.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gcp - 5.15.0-1033.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-gke - 5.4.0-1098.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gke - 5.15.0-1032.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gkeop - 5.4.0-1068.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-ibm - 5.4.0-1048.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-kvm - 5.4.0-1090.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-oracle - 5.4.0-1100.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-oracle - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1084-raspi - 5.4.0-1084.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-148.165\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-lowlatency - 5.4.0-148.165\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-aws - 5.4.0-1101.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-aws - 5.15.0-1035.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-azure - 5.4.0-1107.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-azure - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1107.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1052-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-bluefield - 5.4.0-1062.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-gcp - 5.4.0-1104.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gcp - 5.15.0-1033.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-gke - 5.4.0-1098.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gke - 5.15.0-1032.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gkeop - 5.4.0-1068.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-ibm - 5.4.0-1048.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-kvm - 5.4.0-1090.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-oracle - 5.4.0-1100.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-oracle - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1024.28\nNo subscription required",
