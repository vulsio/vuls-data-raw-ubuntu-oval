		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: ralink: mtmips: fix clocks probe order in oldest ralink SoCsBase clocks are the first in being probed and are real dependencies of therest of fixed, factor and peripheral clocks. For old ralink SoCs RT2880,RT305x and RT3883 'xtal' must be defined first since in any other case,when fixed clocks are probed they are delayed until 'xtal' is probed so thefollowing warning appears: WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at drivers/clk/ralink/clk-mtmips.c:499rt3883_bus_recalc_rate+0x98/0x138 Modules linked in: CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Not tainted 6.6.43 #0 Stack : 805e58d0 00000000 00000004 8004f950 00000000 00000004 0000000000000000 80669c54 80830000 80700000 805ae570 80670068 00000001 80669bf8 00000000 00000000 00000000 805ae570 80669b38 00000020 804db7dc 00000000 00000000 203a6d6d 80669b78 80669e48 70617773 00000000 805ae570 00000000 00000009 00000000 00000001 00000004 00000001 00000000 00000000 83fe43b0 00000000 ...

Now, one userof a Belkin f9k1109 version 1 device which uses RT3883 SoC appeared andreported some issues in openWRT:- https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/issues/16054Thus, define a 'rt2880_xtal_recalc_rate()' just returning the expectedfrequency 40Mhz and use it along the old ralink SoCs to have a correctboot trace with no warnings and a working clock plan from the beggining.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53223` to fix the vulnerability.
