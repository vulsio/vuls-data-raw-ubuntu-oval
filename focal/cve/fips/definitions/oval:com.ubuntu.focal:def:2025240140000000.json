		"description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A segmentation fault wasfound in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typicallydoesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, itis still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of agui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The functionthat handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which willaccess the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated(since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043.",
