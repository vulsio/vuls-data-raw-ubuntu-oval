		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/mad: Improve handling of timed out WRs of mad agentCurrent timeout handler of mad agent acquires/releases mad_agent_privlock for every timed out WRs. This causes heavy locking contentionwhen higher no. of WRs are to be handled inside timeout handler.This leads to softlockup with below trace in some use cases whererdma-cm path is used to establish connection between peer nodesTrace:----- BUG: soft lockup - CPU#4 stuck for 26s!
