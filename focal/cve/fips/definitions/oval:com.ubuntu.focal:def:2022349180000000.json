		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A typeconfusion bug in nft_set_elem_init (leading to a buffer overflow) could beused by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different vulnerabilitythan CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must startwith an unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) Thiscan be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-34918` to fix the vulnerability.
