		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: rpmsg:char: Fix race between the release of rpmsg_ctrldev and cdev structrpmsg_ctrldev contains a struct cdev. The current code frees therpmsg_ctrldev struct in rpmsg_ctrldev_release_device(), but the cdev is amanaged object, therefore its release is not predictable and therpmsg_ctrldev could be freed before the cdev is entirely released, as inthe backtrace below.
