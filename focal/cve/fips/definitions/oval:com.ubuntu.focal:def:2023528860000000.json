Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it tothe race.The best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changingudev->descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.Drivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;we should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change shouldhave been made long ago.So now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying abuffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev hasnot yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and thenhub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)This eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.The changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they reallyare, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoidwriting to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has beeninitialized.  Similar changes should be made to the code that readsthe BOS descriptor, but that can be handled in a separate patch lateron.  This patch is sufficient to fix the bug found by syzbot.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52886` to fix the vulnerability.
