		"description": "It's possible for a gRPC client communicating with a HTTP/2 proxy to poisonthe HPACK table between the proxy and the backend such that other clientssee failed requests. It's also possible to use this vulnerability to leakother clients HTTP header keys, but not values.This occurs because the error status for a misencoded header is not clearedbetween header reads, resulting in subsequent (incrementally indexed) addedheaders in the first request being poisoned until cleared from the HPACKtable.Please update to a fixed version of gRPC as soon as possible. This bug hasbeen fixed in 1.58.3, 1.59.5, 1.60.2, 1.61.3, 1.62.3, 1.63.2, 1.64.3,1.65.4.",
