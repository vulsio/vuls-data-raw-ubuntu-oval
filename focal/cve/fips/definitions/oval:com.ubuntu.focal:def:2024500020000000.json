		"title": "CVE-2024-50002 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:static_call: Handle module init failure correctly instatic_call_del_module()Module insertion invokes static_call_add_module() to initialize the staticcalls in a module. static_call_add_module() invokes __static_call_init(),which allocates a struct static_call_mod to either encapsulate the built-instatic call sites of the associated key into it so further modules can beadded or to append the module to the module chain.If that allocation fails the function returns with an error code and themodule core invokes static_call_del_module() to clean up eventually addedstatic_call_mod entries.This works correctly, when all keys used by the module were converted overto a module chain before the failure. If not then static_call_del_module()causes a #GP as it blindly assumes that key::mods points to a valid structstatic_call_mod.The problem is that key::mods is not a individual struct member of structstatic_call_key, it's part of a union to save space:        union {                /* bit 0: 0 = mods, 1 = sites */                unsigned long type;                struct static_call_mod *mods;                struct static_call_site *sites;\t};key::sites is a pointer to the list of built-in usage sites of the staticcall. The type of the pointer is differentiated by bit 0. A mods pointerhas the bit clear, the sites pointer has the bit set.As static_call_del_module() blidly assumes that the pointer is a validstatic_call_mod type, it fails to check for this failure case anddereferences the pointer to the list of built-in call sites, which isobviously bogus.Cure it by checking whether the key has a sites or a mods pointer.If it's a sites pointer then the key is not to be touched. As the sites arewalked in the same order as in __static_call_init() the site walk can beterminated because all subsequent sites have not been touched by the initcode due to the error exit.If it was converted before the allocation fail, then the inner loop whichsearches for a module match will find nothing.A fail in the second allocation in __static_call_init() is harmless anddoes not require special treatment. The first allocation succeeded andconverted the key to a module chain. That first entry has mod::mod == NULLand mod::next == NULL, so the inner loop of static_call_del_module() willneither find a module match nor a module chain. The next site in the walkwas either already converted, but can't match the module, or it will exitthe outer loop because it has a static_call_site pointer and not astatic_call_mod pointer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50002` to fix the vulnerability.
