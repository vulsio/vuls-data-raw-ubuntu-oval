		"description": "Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server toexpend significant CPU time verifying signatures. With fix, the size of RSAkeys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to <= 8192 bits. Based ona survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only threecertificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all threeappear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It ispossible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target theweb PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing thedefault safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.",
