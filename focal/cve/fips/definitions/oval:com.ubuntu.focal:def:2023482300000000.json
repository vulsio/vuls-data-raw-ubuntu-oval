		"description": "Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and capability-based RPC system.In versions 1.0 and 1.0.1, when using the KJ HTTP library with WebSocketcompression enabled, a buffer underrun can be caused by a remote peer. Theunderrun always writes a constant value that is not attacker-controlled,likely resulting in a crash, enabling a remote denial-of-service attack.Most Cap'n Proto and KJ users are unlikely to have this functionalityenabled and so unlikely to be affected. Maintainers suspect only theCloudflare Workers Runtime is affected. If KJ HTTP is used with WebSocketcompression enabled, a malicious peer may be able to cause a bufferunderrun on a heap-allocated buffer. KJ HTTP is an optional library bundledwith Cap'n Proto, but is not directly used by Cap'n Proto. WebSocketcompression is disabled by default. It must be enabled via a setting passedto the KJ HTTP library via `HttpClientSettings` or `HttpServerSettings`.The bytes written out-of-bounds are always a specific constant 4-bytestring `{ 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF }`. Because this string is not controlledby the attacker, maintainers believe it is unlikely that remote codeexecution is possible. However, it cannot be ruled out. This functionalityfirst appeared in Cap'n Proto 1.0. Previous versions are not affected. Thisissue is fixed in Cap'n Proto 1.0.1.1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-48230` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncapnproto - 0.7.0-6\nlibcapnp-0.7.0 - 0.7.0-6\nNo subscription required",
