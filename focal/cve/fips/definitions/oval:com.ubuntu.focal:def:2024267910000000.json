		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:dev-replace: properly validate device names There's a syzbot report thatdevice name buffers passed to device replace are not properly checked forstring termination which could lead to a read out of bounds ingetname_kernel(). Add a helper that validates both source and target devicename buffers. For devid as the source initialize the buffer to empty stringin case something tries to read it later. This was originally analyzed andfixed in a different way by Edward Adam Davis (see links).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26791` to fix the vulnerability.
