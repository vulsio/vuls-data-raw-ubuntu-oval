		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs/aio:Check IOCB_AIO_RW before the struct aio_kiocb conversion The firstkiocb_set_cancel_fn() argument may point at a struct kiocb that is notembedded inside struct aio_kiocb. With the current code, depending on thecompiler, the req->ki_ctx read happens either before the IOCB_AIO_RW testor after that test. Move the req->ki_ctx read such that it is guaranteedthat the IOCB_AIO_RW test happens first.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35815` to fix the vulnerability.
