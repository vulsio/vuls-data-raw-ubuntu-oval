		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix index out of bounds in DCN30 degamma hardware formattranslationThis commit addresses a potential index out of bounds issue in the`cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format` function in the DCN30color  management module. The issue could occur when the index 'i'exceeds the  number of transfer function points (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS).The fix adds a check to ensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing thetransfer function points. If 'i' is out of bounds, the function returnsfalse to indicate an error.Reported by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn30/dcn30_cm_common.c:338cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.red' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn30/dcn30_cm_common.c:339cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.green' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn30/dcn30_cm_common.c:340cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.blue' 1025 <= s32max",
