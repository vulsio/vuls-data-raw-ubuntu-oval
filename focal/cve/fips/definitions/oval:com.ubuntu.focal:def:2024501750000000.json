		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: qcom: camss: Remove use_count guard in stop_streamingThe use_count check was introduced so that multiple concurrent Raw DataInterfaces RDIs could be driven by different virtual channels VCs on theCSIPHY input driving the video pipeline.This is an invalid use of use_count though as use_count pertains to thenumber of times a video entity has been opened by user-space not the numberof active streams.If use_count and stream-on count don't agree then stop_streaming() willbreak as is currently the case and has become apparent when using CAMSSwith libcamera's released softisp 0.3.The use of use_count like this is a bit hacky and right now breaks regularusage of CAMSS for a single stream case. Stopping qcam results in the splatbelow, and then it cannot be started again and any attempts to do so failswith -EBUSY.[ 1265.509831] WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 919 atdrivers/media/common/videobuf2/videobuf2-core.c:2183__vb2_queue_cancel+0x230/0x2c8 [videobuf2_common]...[ 1265.510630] Call trace:[ 1265.510636]  __vb2_queue_cancel+0x230/0x2c8 [videobuf2_common][ 1265.510648]  vb2_core_streamoff+0x24/0xcc [videobuf2_common][ 1265.510660]  vb2_ioctl_streamoff+0x5c/0xa8 [videobuf2_v4l2][ 1265.510673]  v4l_streamoff+0x24/0x30 [videodev][ 1265.510707]  __video_do_ioctl+0x190/0x3f4 [videodev][ 1265.510732]  video_usercopy+0x304/0x8c4 [videodev][ 1265.510757]  video_ioctl2+0x18/0x34 [videodev][ 1265.510782]  v4l2_ioctl+0x40/0x60 [videodev]...[ 1265.510944] videobuf2_common: driver bug: stop_streaming operation isleaving buffer 0 in active state[ 1265.511175] videobuf2_common: driver bug: stop_streaming operation isleaving buffer 1 in active state[ 1265.511398] videobuf2_common: driver bug: stop_streaming operation isleaving buffer 2 in active stOne CAMSS specific way to handle multiple VCs on the same RDI might be:- Reference count each pipeline enable for CSIPHY, CSID, VFE and RDIx.- The video buffers are already associated with msm_vfeN_rdiX so  release video buffers when told to do so by stop_streaming.- Only release the power-domains for the CSIPHY, CSID and VFE when  their internal refcounts drop.Either way refusing to release video buffers based on use_count iserroneous and should be reverted. The silicon enabling code for selectingVCs is perfectly fine. Its a \"known missing feature\" that concurrent VCswon't work with CAMSS right now.Initial testing with this code didn't show an error but, SoftISP and \"real\"usage with Google Hangouts breaks the upstream code pretty quickly, we needto do a partial revert and take another pass at VCs.This commit partially reverts commit 89013969e232 (\"media: camss: sm8250:Pipeline starting and stopping for multiple virtual channels\")\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50175` to fix the vulnerability.
