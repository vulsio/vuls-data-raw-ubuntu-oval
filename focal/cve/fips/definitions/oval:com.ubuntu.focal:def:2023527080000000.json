		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mmc:mmc_spi: fix error handling in mmc_spi_probe() If mmc_add_host() fails, itdoesn't need to call mmc_remove_host(), or it will cause null-ptr-deref,because of deleting a not added device in mmc_remove_host(). To fix this,goto label 'fail_glue_init', if mmc_add_host() fails, and change the label'fail_add_host' to 'fail_gpiod_request'.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52708` to fix the vulnerability.
