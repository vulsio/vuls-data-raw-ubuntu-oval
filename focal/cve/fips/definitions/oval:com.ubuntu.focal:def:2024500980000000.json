		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: ufs: core: Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut downThere is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginningof booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LU's scsi_devices by UFSshutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting onblk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary.After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown waswaiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, setSDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes downafter a UFS shutdown will return an error.[   31.907781]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]        1        1307050071651079834      11289729804                0 D(   2) 3 ffffff882e208000 *          init [device_shutdown][   31.907793]I[0:      swapper/0:    0] Mutex: 0xffffff8849a2b8b0:owner[0xffffff882e28cb00 kworker/6:0 :49][   31.907806]I[0:      swapper/0:    0] Call trace:[   31.907810]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __switch_to+0x174/0x338[   31.907819]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __schedule+0x5ec/0x9cc[   31.907826]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  schedule+0x7c/0xe8[   31.907834]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]schedule_preempt_disabled+0x24/0x40[   31.907842]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __mutex_lock+0x408/0xdac[   31.907849]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __mutex_lock_slowpath+0x14/0x24[   31.907858]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  mutex_lock+0x40/0xec[   31.907866]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  device_shutdown+0x108/0x280[   31.907875]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  kernel_restart+0x4c/0x11c[   31.907883]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __arm64_sys_reboot+0x15c/0x280[   31.907890]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  invoke_syscall+0x70/0x158[   31.907899]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  el0_svc_common+0xb4/0xf4[   31.907909]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  do_el0_svc+0x2c/0xb0[   31.907918]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  el0_svc+0x34/0xe0[   31.907928]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  el0t_64_sync_handler+0x68/0xb4[   31.907937]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4[   31.908774]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]       49                011960702      11236868007                0 D(   2) 6 ffffff882e28cb00 * kworker/6:0 [__bio_queue_enter][   31.908783]I[0:      swapper/0:    0] Call trace:[   31.908788]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __switch_to+0x174/0x338[   31.908796]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __schedule+0x5ec/0x9cc[   31.908803]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  schedule+0x7c/0xe8[   31.908811]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __bio_queue_enter+0xb8/0x178[   31.908818]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  blk_mq_submit_bio+0x194/0x67c[   31.908827]I[0:      swapper/0:    0]  __submit_bio+0xb8/0x19c\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50098` to fix the vulnerability.
