		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse versions before 1.106are vulnerable to a disk fill attack, where an unauthenticated adversarycan induce Synapse to download and cache large amounts of remote media. Thedefault rate limit strategy is insufficient to mitigate this. This can leadto a denial of service, ranging from further media uploads/downloadsfailing to completely unavailability of the Synapse process, depending onhow Synapse was deployed. Synapse 1.106 introduces a new \"leaky bucket\"rate limit on remote media downloads to reduce the amount of data a usercan request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but doeslimit an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data tobe cached.",
