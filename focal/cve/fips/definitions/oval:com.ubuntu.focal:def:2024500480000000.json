		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fbcon: Fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in fbcon_putcssyzbot has found a NULL pointer dereference bug in fbcon.Here is the simplified C reproducer:struct param {\tuint8_t type;\tstruct tiocl_selection ts;};int main(){\tstruct fb_con2fbmap con2fb;\tstruct param param;\tint fd = open(\"/dev/fb1\", 0, 0);\tcon2fb.console = 0x19;\tcon2fb.framebuffer = 0;\tioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP, &con2fb);\tparam.type = 2;\tparam.ts.xs = 0; param.ts.ys = 0;\tparam.ts.xe = 0; param.ts.ye = 0;\tparam.ts.sel_mode = 0;\tint fd1 = open(\"/dev/tty1\", O_RDWR, 0);\tioctl(fd1, TIOCLINUX, &param);\tcon2fb.console = 1;\tcon2fb.framebuffer = 0;\tioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP, &con2fb);\treturn 0;}After calling ioctl(fd1, TIOCLINUX, &param), the subsequent ioctl(fd,FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP, &con2fb)causes the kernel to follow a different execution path: set_con2fb_map  -> con2fb_init_display   -> fbcon_set_disp    -> redraw_screen     -> hide_cursor      -> clear_selection       -> highlight        -> invert_screen         -> do_update_region          -> fbcon_putcs           -> ops->putcsSince ops->putcs is a NULL pointer, this leads to a kernel panic.To prevent this, we need to call set_blitting_type() withinset_con2fb_map()to properly initialize ops->putcs.",
