		"description": "Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved MemoryRegions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, \"RMRR\") forIntel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically usedfor platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a deviceassociated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regionsneed to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logicestablishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting insuch mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have beenremoved again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memoryregions which they aren't supposed to have access to.",
