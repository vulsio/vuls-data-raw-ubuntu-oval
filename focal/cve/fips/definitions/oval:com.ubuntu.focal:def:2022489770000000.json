		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: af_can: fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rcv_filterAnalogue to commit 8aa59e355949 (\"can: af_can: fix NULL pointerdereference in can_rx_register()\") we need to check for a missinginitialization of ml_priv in the receive path of CAN frames.Since commit 4e096a18867a (\"net: introduce CAN specific pointer in thestruct net_device\") the check for dev->type to be ARPHRD_CAN is notsufficient anymore since bonding or tun netdevices claim to be CANdevices but do not initialize ml_priv accordingly.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48977` to fix the vulnerability.
