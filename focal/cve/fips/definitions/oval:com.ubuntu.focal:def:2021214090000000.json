In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. Thecontent-length header is not correctly validated if the request only uses asingle Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to true. This could leadto request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer andtranslated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup ofGHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix this one case.This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21409` to fix the vulnerability.
