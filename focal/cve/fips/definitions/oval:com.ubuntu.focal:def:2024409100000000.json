		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ax25: Fix refcount imbalance on inbound connectionsWhen releasing a socket in ax25_release(), we call netdev_put() todecrease the refcount on the associated ax.25 device. However, theexecution path for accepting an incoming connection never callsnetdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors, and ultimatelyto kernel crashes.A typical call trace for the above situation will start with one of thefollowing errors:    refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.    refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.And will then have a trace like:    Call Trace:    <TASK>    ? show_regs+0x64/0x70    ? __warn+0x83/0x120    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100    ? report_bug+0x158/0x190    ? prb_read_valid+0x20/0x30    ? handle_bug+0x3e/0x70    ? exc_invalid_op+0x1c/0x70    ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100    ax25_release+0x2ad/0x360    __sock_release+0x35/0xa0    sock_close+0x19/0x20    [...]On reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel getsstuck in an infinite loop:    unregister_netdevice: waiting for ax0 to become free. Usage count = 0This patch corrects these issues by ensuring that we call netdev_hold()and ax25_dev_hold() for new connections in ax25_accept(). This makes thelogic leading to ax25_accept() match the logic for ax25_bind(): in bothcases we increment the refcount, which is ultimately decremented inax25_release().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40910` to fix the vulnerability.
