		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/page_alloc: let GFP_ATOMIC order-0 allocs access highatomic reservesUnder memory pressure it's possible for GFP_ATOMIC order-0 allocations tofail even though free pages are available in the highatomic reserves.GFP_ATOMIC allocations cannot trigger unreserve_highatomic_pageblock()since it's only run from reclaim.Given that such allocations will pass the watermarks in__zone_watermark_unusable_free(), it makes sense to fallback to highatomicreserves the same way that ALLOC_OOM can.This fixes order-0 page allocation failures observed on Cloudflare's fleetwhen handling network packets:  kswapd1: page allocation failure: order:0, mode:0x820(GFP_ATOMIC),  nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0-7  CPU: 10 PID: 696 Comm: kswapd1 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G           O6.6.43-CUSTOM #1  Hardware name: MACHINE  Call Trace:   <IRQ>   dump_stack_lvl+0x3c/0x50   warn_alloc+0x13a/0x1c0   __alloc_pages_slowpath.constprop.0+0xc9d/0xd10   __alloc_pages+0x327/0x340   __napi_alloc_skb+0x16d/0x1f0   bnxt_rx_page_skb+0x96/0x1b0 [bnxt_en]   bnxt_rx_pkt+0x201/0x15e0 [bnxt_en]   __bnxt_poll_work+0x156/0x2b0 [bnxt_en]   bnxt_poll+0xd9/0x1c0 [bnxt_en]   __napi_poll+0x2b/0x1b0   bpf_trampoline_6442524138+0x7d/0x1000   __napi_poll+0x5/0x1b0   net_rx_action+0x342/0x740   handle_softirqs+0xcf/0x2b0   irq_exit_rcu+0x6c/0x90   sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x72/0x90   </IRQ>[mfleming@cloudflare.com: update comment]  Link:https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20241015125158.3597702-1-matt@readmodwrite.com",
