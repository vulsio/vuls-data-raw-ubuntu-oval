Now I understand your patch. Honestly, seeing how fragile is tryingto fix extent tree after split has failed in the middle, I would probablygo even further and make sure we fix the tree properly in case of ENOSPCand EDQUOT (those are easily user triggerable). Anything else indicates aHW problem or fs corruption so I'd rather leave the extent tree as is anddon't try to fix it (which also means we will not create overlappingextents).\"\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47117` to fix the vulnerability.
