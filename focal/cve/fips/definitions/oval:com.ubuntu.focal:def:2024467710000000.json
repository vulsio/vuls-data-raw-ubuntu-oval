		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: bcm: Remove proc entry when dev is unregistered.syzkaller reported a warning in bcm_connect() below. [0]The repro calls connect() to vxcan1, removes vxcan1, and callsconnect() with ifindex == 0.Calling connect() for a BCM socket allocates a proc entry.Then, bcm_sk(sk)->bound is set to 1 to prevent further connect().However, removing the bound device resets bcm_sk(sk)->bound to 0in bcm_notify().The 2nd connect() tries to allocate a proc entry with the samename and sets NULL to bcm_sk(sk)->bcm_proc_read, leaking theoriginal proc entry.Since the proc entry is available only for connect()ed sockets,let's clean up the entry when the bound netdev is unregistered.[0]:proc_dir_entry 'can-bcm/2456' already registeredWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 394 at fs/proc/generic.c:376 proc_register+0x645/0x8f0fs/proc/generic.c:375Modules linked in:CPU: 1 PID: 394 Comm: syz-executor403 Not tainted 6.10.0-rc7-g852e42cc2dd4Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOSrel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:proc_register+0x645/0x8f0 fs/proc/generic.c:375Code: 00 00 00 00 00 48 85 ed 0f 85 97 02 00 00 4d 85 f6 0f 85 9f 02 00 0048 c7 c7 9b cb cf 87 48 89 de 4c 89 fa e8 1c 6f eb fe 90 <0f> 0b 90 90 48c7 c7 98 37 99 89 e8 cb 7e 22 05 bb 00 00 00 10 48RSP: 0018:ffa0000000cd7c30 EFLAGS: 00010246RAX: 9e129be1950f0200 RBX: ff1100011b51582c RCX: ff1100011857cd80RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: 0000000000000002RBP: 0000000000000000 R08: ffd400000000000f R09: ff1100013e78cac0R10: ffac800000cd7980 R11: ff1100013e12b1f0 R12: 0000000000000000R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ff1100011a99a2ecFS:  00007fbd7086f740(0000) GS:ff1100013fd00000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00000000200071c0 CR3: 0000000118556004 CR4: 0000000000771ef0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe07f0 DR7: 0000000000000400PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <TASK> proc_create_net_single+0x144/0x210 fs/proc/proc_net.c:220 bcm_connect+0x472/0x840 net/can/bcm.c:1673 __sys_connect_file net/socket.c:2049 [inline] __sys_connect+0x5d2/0x690 net/socket.c:2066 __do_sys_connect net/socket.c:2076 [inline] __se_sys_connect net/socket.c:2073 [inline] __x64_sys_connect+0x8f/0x100 net/socket.c:2073 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd9/0x1c0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53RIP: 0033:0x7fbd708b0e5dCode: ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 f3 0f 1e fa 48 89 f8 48 89 f748 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 <48> 3d 01 f0 ffff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d 73 9f 1b 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48RSP: 002b:00007fff8cd33f08 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 000000000000002aRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000003 RCX: 00007fbd708b0e5dRDX: 0000000000000010 RSI: 0000000020000040 RDI: 0000000000000003RBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000040 R09: 0000000000000040R10: 0000000000000040 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007fff8cd34098R13: 0000000000401280 R14: 0000000000406de8 R15: 00007fbd70ab9000 </TASK>remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'net/can-bcm', leaking atleast '2456'",
