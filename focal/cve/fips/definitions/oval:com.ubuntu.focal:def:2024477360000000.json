		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:erofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properlysyzbot reported a task hang issue due to a deadlock case where it iswaiting for the folio lock of a cached folio that will be used forcache I/Os.After looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found it's formed withseveral overlapped big pclusters as below: Ext:   logical offset   |  length :     physical offset    |  length   0:        0..   16384 |   16384 :     151552..    167936 |   16384   1:    16384..   32768 |   16384 :     155648..    172032 |   16384   2:    32768..   49152 |   16384 :  537223168.. 537239552 |   16384...Here, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although it's entirely_impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs.First, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked asup-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) whencompressed I/Os are complete.  If physical blocks are not submitted inthe incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependencyissues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()and BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.Second, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters forefficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implementeasily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear infuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pagesfor correctness.Additionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot betruncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 (\"erofs: tidyup `struct z_erofs_bvec`\") for simplicity although it shouldn't be anydifference.",
