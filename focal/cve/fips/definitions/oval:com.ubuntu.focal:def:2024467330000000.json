		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix qgroup reserve leaks in cow_file_rangeIn the buffered write path, the dirty page owns the qgroup reserve untilit creates an ordered_extent.Therefore, any errors that occur before the ordered_extent is createdmust free that reservation, or else the space is leaked. The fstestgeneric/475 exercises various IO error paths, and is able to triggererrors in cow_file_range where we fail to get to allocating the orderedextent. Note that because we *do* clear delalloc, we are likely toremove the inode from the delalloc list, so the inodes/pages to not haveinvalidate/launder called on them in the commit abort path.This results in failures at the unmount stage of the test that look like:  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in cleanup_transaction:2018: errno=-5IO failure  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in btrfs_replace_file_extents:2416:errno=-5 IO failure  BTRFS warning (device dm-8 state EA): qgroup 0/5 has unreleased space,type 0 rsv 28672  ------------[ cut here ]------------  WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 22588 at fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:4333close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]  Modules linked in: btrfs blake2b_generic libcrc32c xor zstd_compressraid6_pq  CPU: 3 PID: 22588 Comm: umount Kdump: loaded Tainted: G W6.10.0-rc7-gab56fde445b8 #21  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS Arch Linux1.16.3-1-1 04/01/2014  RIP: 0010:close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]  RSP: 0018:ffffb4465283be00 EFLAGS: 00010202  RAX: 0000000000000001 RBX: ffffa1a1818e1000 RCX: 0000000000000001  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffb4465283bbe0 RDI: ffffa1a19374fcb8  RBP: ffffa1a1818e13c0 R08: 0000000100028b16 R09: 0000000000000000  R10: 0000000000000003 R11: 0000000000000003 R12: ffffa1a18ad7972c  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000  FS:  00007f9168312b80(0000) GS:ffffa1a4afcc0000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 00007f91683c9140 CR3: 000000010acaa000 CR4: 00000000000006f0  Call Trace:   <TASK>   ? close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]   ? __warn.cold+0x8e/0xea   ? close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]   ? report_bug+0xff/0x140   ? handle_bug+0x3b/0x70   ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20   ? close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]   generic_shutdown_super+0x70/0x160   kill_anon_super+0x11/0x40   btrfs_kill_super+0x11/0x20 [btrfs]   deactivate_locked_super+0x2e/0xa0   cleanup_mnt+0xb5/0x150   task_work_run+0x57/0x80   syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x121/0x130   do_syscall_64+0xab/0x1a0   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f  RIP: 0033:0x7f916847a887  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---  BTRFS error (device dm-8 state EA): qgroup reserved space leakedCases 2 and 3 in the out_reserve path both pertain to this type of leakand must free the reserved qgroup data.
