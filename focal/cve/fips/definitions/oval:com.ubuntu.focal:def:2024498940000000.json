		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix index out of bounds in degamma hardware formattranslationFixes index out of bounds issue in`cm_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format` function. The issuecould occur when the index 'i' exceeds the number of transfer functionpoints (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS).The fix adds a check to ensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing thetransfer function points. If 'i' is out of bounds the function returnsfalse to indicate an error.Reported by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn10/dcn10_cm_common.c:594cm_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.red' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn10/dcn10_cm_common.c:595cm_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.green' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn10/dcn10_cm_common.c:596cm_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.blue' 1025 <= s32max\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-49894` to fix the vulnerability.
