		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: light: vcnl4035: fix information leak in triggered bufferThe 'buffer' local array is used to push data to userspace from atriggered buffer, but it does not set an initial value for the singledata element, which is an u16 aligned to 8 bytes. That leaves at least4 bytes uninitialized even after writing an integer value withregmap_read().Initialize the array to zero before using it to avoid pushinguninitialized information to userspace.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-57910` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-fips - 5.4.0-1007.8\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1007-fips - 5.4.0-1007.8\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips2\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1021-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1022.22+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1022-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1022.22+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1021-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1021.21+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
