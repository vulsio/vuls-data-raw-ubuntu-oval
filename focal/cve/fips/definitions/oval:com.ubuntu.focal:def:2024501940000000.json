		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernelsThe arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn'tconvert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is alwayslittle-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing andsimulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can  safely be probed.* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped  out-of-line safely.* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()  which similarly does not handle endianness.* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 andadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consumingthe instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaqueranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently useAARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.Tested with the following:| #include <stdio.h>| #include <stdbool.h>|| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))|| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)| {|         void *addr;||         asm volatile(|         \"       adrp    %x0, adrp_self\\n\"|         \"       add     %x0, %x0, :lo12:adrp_self\\n\"|         : \"=r\" (addr));| }||| int main(int argc, char *argv)| {|         void *ptr = adrp_self();|         bool equal = (ptr == adrp_self);||         printf(\"adrp_self   => %p\\n\"|                \"adrp_self() => %p\\n\"|                \"%s\\n\",|                adrp_self, ptr, equal ? \"EQUAL\" : \"NOT EQUAL\");||         return 0;| }.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:| 00000000004007e0 <adrp_self>:|   4007e0:       90000000        adrp    x0, 400000 <__ehdr_start>|   4007e4:       911f8000        add     x0, x0, #0x7e0|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        retBefore this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to besteppable, resulting in corruption of the result:| # ./adrp-self| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0| EQUAL| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable| # ./adrp-self| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0| adrp_self() => 0xffffffffff7e0| NOT EQUALAfter this patch, the ADRP is correctly recognized and simulated:| # ./adrp-self| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0| EQUAL| #| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable| # ./adrp-self| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0| EQUAL",
