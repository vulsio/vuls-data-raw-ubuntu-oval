Thatchange correctly sought to avoid an srcu v. config_lock inversion bybreaking up the vCPU teardown into two parts, one guarded by theconfig_lock.Fix the use-after-free while avoiding lock inversion by adding aspecial-cased unregistration to __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). This is safebecause failed vCPUs are torn down outside of the config_lock.",
