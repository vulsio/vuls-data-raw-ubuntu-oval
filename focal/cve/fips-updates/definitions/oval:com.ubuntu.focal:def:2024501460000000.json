		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Don't call cleanup on profile rollback failureWhen profile rollback fails in mlx5e_netdev_change_profile, the netdevprofile var is left set to NULL. Avoid a crash when unloading the driverby not calling profile->cleanup in such a case.This was encountered while testing, with the original trigger thatthe wq rescuer thread creation got interrupted (presumably due toCtrl+C-ing modprobe), which gets converted to ENOMEM (-12) bymlx5e_priv_init, the profile rollback also fails for the same reason(signal still active) so the profile is left as NULL, leading to a crashlater in _mlx5e_remove.
