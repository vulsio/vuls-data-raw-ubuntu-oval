		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iavf: Fix hang during reboot/shutdownRecent commit 974578017fc1 (\"iavf: Add waiting so the port isinitialized in remove\") adds a wait-loop at the beginning ofiavf_remove() to ensure that port initialization is finishedprior unregistering net device. This causes a regressionin reboot/shutdown scenario because in this case callbackiavf_shutdown() is called and this callback detaches the device,makes it down if it is running and sets its state to __IAVF_REMOVE.Later shutdown callback of associated PF driver (e.g. ice_shutdown)is called. That callback calls among other things sriov_disable()that calls indirectly iavf_remove() (see stack trace below).As the adapter state is already __IAVF_REMOVE then the mentionedloop is end-less and shutdown process hangs.The patch fixes this by checking adapter's state at the beginningof iavf_remove() and skips the rest of the function if the adapteris already in remove state (shutdown is in progress).Reproducer:1. Create VF on PF driven by ice or i40e driver2. Ensure that the VF is bound to iavf driver3.
