		"title": "CVE-2022-48933 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-updates 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leak during stateful obj updatestateful objects can be updated from the control plane.The transaction logic allocates a temporary object for this purpose.The ->init function was called for this object, so plain kfree() leaksresources. We must call ->destroy function of the object.nft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,but the update path doesn't increment it.To avoid special-casing the update object release, do module_get forthe update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48933` to fix the vulnerability.
