		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse before version 1.106allows, by design, unauthenticated remote participants to trigger adownload and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the localmedia repository. Such content then also becomes available for downloadfrom the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication isthat unauthenticated remote adversaries can use this functionality to plantproblematic content into the media repository. Synapse 1.106 introduces apartial mitigation in the form of new endpoints which requireauthentication for media downloads. The unauthenticated endpoints will befrozen in a future release, closing the attack vector.",
