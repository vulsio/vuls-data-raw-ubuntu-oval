		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfs: Don't evict inode under the inode lru traversing contextThe inode reclaiming process(See function prune_icache_sb) collects allreclaimable inodes and mark them with I_FREEING flag at first, at thattime, other processes will be stuck if they try getting these inodes(See function find_inode_fast), then the reclaiming process destroy theinodes by function dispose_list(). Some filesystems(eg. ext4 withea_inode feature, ubifs with xattr) may do inode lookup in the inodeevicting callback function, if the inode lookup is operated under theinode lru traversing context, deadlock problems may happen.Case 1: In function ext4_evict_inode(), the ea inode lookup could happen        if ea_inode feature is enabled, the lookup process will be stuck\tunder the evicting context like this: 1. File A has inode i_reg and an ea inode i_ea 2. getfattr(A, xattr_buf) // i_ea is added into lru // lru->i_ea 3. Then, following three processes running like this:    PA                              PB echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  shrink_slab   prune_dcache_sb   // i_reg is added into lru, lru->i_ea->i_reg   prune_icache_sb    list_lru_walk_one     inode_lru_isolate      i_ea->i_state |= I_FREEING // set inode state     inode_lru_isolate      __iget(i_reg)      spin_unlock(&i_reg->i_lock)      spin_unlock(lru_lock)                                     rm file A                                      i_reg->nlink = 0      iput(i_reg) // i_reg->nlink is 0, do evict       ext4_evict_inode        ext4_xattr_delete_inode         ext4_xattr_inode_dec_ref_all          ext4_xattr_inode_iget           ext4_iget(i_ea->i_ino)            iget_locked             find_inode_fast              __wait_on_freeing_inode(i_ea) ----? AA deadlock    dispose_list // cannot be executed by prune_icache_sb     wake_up_bit(&i_ea->i_state)Case 2: In deleted inode writing function ubifs_jnl_write_inode(), file        deleting process holds BASEHD's wbuf->io_mutex while getting the\txattr inode, which could race with inode reclaiming process(The        reclaiming process could try locking BASEHD's wbuf->io_mutex in\tinode evicting function), then an ABBA deadlock problem would\thappen as following: 1. File A has inode ia and a xattr(with inode ixa), regular file B has    inode ib and a xattr. 2. getfattr(A, xattr_buf) // ixa is added into lru // lru->ixa 3.
