		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mac80211: fix mbss changed flags corruption on 32 bit systemsOn 32-bit systems, the size of an unsigned long is 4 bytes,while a u64 is 8 bytes. Therefore, when usingor_each_set_bit(bit, &bits, sizeof(changed) * BITS_PER_BYTE),the code is incorrectly searching for a bit in a 32-bitvariable that is expected to be 64 bits in size,leading to incorrect bit finding.Solution: Ensure that the size of the bits variable is correctlyadjusted for each architecture.
