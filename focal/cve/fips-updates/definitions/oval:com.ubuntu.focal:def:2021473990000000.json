		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ixgbe:Fix NULL pointer dereference in ixgbe_xdp_setup The ixgbe driver currentlygenerates a NULL pointer dereference with some machine (online cpus < 63).This is due to the fact that the maximum value of num_xdp_queues isnr_cpu_ids. Code is in \"ixgbe_set_rss_queues\"\". Here's how the problemrepeats itself: Some machine (online cpus < 63), And user set num_queues to63 through ethtool. Code is in the \"ixgbe_set_channels\",adapter->ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR].limit = count; It becomes 63. When useruse xdp, \"ixgbe_set_rss_queues\" will set queues num. adapter->num_rx_queues= rss_i; adapter->num_tx_queues = rss_i; adapter->num_xdp_queues =ixgbe_xdp_queues(adapter); And rss_i's value is from f =&adapter->ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR]; rss_i = f->indices = f->limit; So\"num_rx_queues\" > \"num_xdp_queues\", when run to \"ixgbe_xdp_setup\", for (i =0; i < adapter->num_rx_queues; i++) if (adapter->xdp_ring[i]->xsk_umem) Itleads to panic.
