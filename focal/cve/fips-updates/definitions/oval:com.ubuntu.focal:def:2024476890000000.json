So, it is safe to notset SB_RDONLY flag, let's remove the logic and keep in line w/ ext4 [3].[1]https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240729-himbeeren-funknetz-96e62f9c7aee@brauner[2] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240729132721.hxih6ehigadqf7wx@quack3[3] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/20240805201241.27286-1-jack@suse.cz",
