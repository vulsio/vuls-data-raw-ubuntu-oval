		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bootconfig: use memblock_free_late to free xbc memory to buddy On the timeto free xbc memory in xbc_exit(), memblock may has handed over memory tobuddy allocator. So it doesn't make sense to free memory back to memblock.memblock_free() called by xbc_exit() even causes UAF bugs on architectureswith CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK disabled like x86. Following KASAN logsshows this case. This patch fixes the xbc memory free problem by callingmemblock_free() in early xbc init error rewind path and callingmemblock_free_late() in xbc exit path to free memory to buddy allocator.
