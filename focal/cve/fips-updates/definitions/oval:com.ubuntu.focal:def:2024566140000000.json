Due to implicit type conversion, a large unsigned value formap->max_entries can bypass the intended bounds check:\tif (k >= map->max_entries)\t\treturn -EINVAL;This allows k to hold a negative value (between -2147483648 and -2),which is then used as an array index in m->xsk_map[k], which resultsin an out-of-bounds access.\tspin_lock_bh(&m->lock);\tmap_entry = &m->xsk_map[k]; // Out-of-bounds map_entry\told_xs = unrcu_pointer(xchg(map_entry, NULL));  // Oob write\tif (old_xs)\t\txsk_map_sock_delete(old_xs, map_entry);\tspin_unlock_bh(&m->lock);The xchg operation can then be used to cause an out-of-bounds write.Moreover, the invalid map_entry passed to xsk_map_sock_delete can leadto further memory corruption.\"It indeed results in following splat:[76612.897343] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address:ffffc8fc2e461108[76612.904330] #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode[76612.909639] #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page[76612.914855] PGD 0 P4D 0[76612.917431] Oops: Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP[76612.921859] CPU: 11 UID: 0 PID: 10318 Comm: a.out Not tainted6.12.0-rc1+ #470[76612.929189] Hardware name: Intel Corporation S2600WFT/S2600WFT, BIOSSE5C620.86B.02.01.0008.031920191559 03/19/2019[76612.939781] RIP: 0010:xsk_map_delete_elem+0x2d/0x60[76612.944738] Code: 00 00 41 54 55 53 48 63 2e 3b 6f 24 73 38 4c 8d a7 f800 00 00 48 89 fb 4c 89 e7 e8 2d bf 05 00 48 8d b4 eb 00 01 00 00 31 ff<48> 87 3e 48 85 ff 74 05 e8 16 ff ff ff 4c 89 e7 e8 3e bc 05 00 31[76612.963774] RSP: 0018:ffffc9002e407df8 EFLAGS: 00010246[76612.969079] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffc9002e461000 RCX:0000000000000000[76612.976323] RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffc8fc2e461108 RDI:0000000000000000[76612.983569] RBP: ffffffff80000001 R08: 0000000000000000 R09:0000000000000007[76612.990812] R10: ffffc9002e407e18 R11: ffff888108a38858 R12:ffffc9002e4610f8[76612.998060] R13: ffff888108a38858 R14: 00007ffd1ae0ac78 R15:ffffc9002e4610c0[76613.005303] FS:  00007f80b6f59740(0000) GS:ffff8897e0ec0000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000[76613.013517] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[76613.019349] CR2: ffffc8fc2e461108 CR3: 000000011e3ef001 CR4:00000000007726f0[76613.026595] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2:0000000000000000[76613.033841] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7:0000000000000400[76613.041086] PKRU: 55555554[76613.043842] Call Trace:[76613.046331]  <TASK>[76613.048468]  ? __die+0x20/0x60[76613.051581]  ? page_fault_oops+0x15a/0x450[76613.055747]  ? search_extable+0x22/0x30[76613.059649]  ? search_bpf_extables+0x5f/0x80[76613.063988]  ? exc_page_fault+0xa9/0x140[76613.067975]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30[76613.072229]  ? xsk_map_delete_elem+0x2d/0x60[76613.076573]  ? xsk_map_delete_elem+0x23/0x60[76613.080914]  __sys_bpf+0x19b7/0x23c0[76613.084555]  __x64_sys_bpf+0x1a/0x20[76613.088194]  do_syscall_64+0x37/0xb0[76613.091832]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53[76613.096962] RIP: 0033:0x7f80b6d1e88d[76613.100592] Code: 5b 41 5c c3 66 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 f3 0f 1e fa 4889 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05<48> 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d 73 b5 0f 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48[76613.119631] RSP: 002b:00007ffd1ae0ac68 EFLAGS: 00000206 ORIG_RAX:0000000000000141[76613.131330] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX:00007f80b6d1e88d[76613.142632] RDX: 0000000000000098 RSI: 00007ffd1ae0ad20 RDI:0000000000000003[76613.153967] RBP: 00007ffd1ae0adc0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09:0000000000000000[76613.166030] R10: 00007f80b6f77040 R11: 0000000000000206 R12:00007ffd1ae0aed8[76613.177130] R13: 000055ddf42ce1e9 R14: 000055ddf42d0d98 R15: 00---truncated---",
