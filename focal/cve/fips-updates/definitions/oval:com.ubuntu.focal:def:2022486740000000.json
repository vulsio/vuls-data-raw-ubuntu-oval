		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: erofs:fix pcluster use-after-free on UP platforms During stress testing withCONFIG_SMP disabled, KASAN reports as below:================================================================== BUG:KASAN: use-after-free in __mutex_lock+0xe5/0xc30 Read of size 8 at addrffff8881094223f8 by task stress/7789 CPU: 0 PID: 7789 Comm: stress Nottainted 6.0.0-rc1-00002-g0d53d2e882f9 #3 Hardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS0.5.1 01/01/2011 Call Trace: <TASK> .. __mutex_lock+0xe5/0xc30 ..z_erofs_do_read_page+0x8ce/0x1560 .. z_erofs_readahead+0x31c/0x580 ..

Let'sdrop such specific-designed path directly instead.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48674` to fix the vulnerability.
