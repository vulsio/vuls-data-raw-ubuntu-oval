		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/kmemleak: avoid scanning potential huge holes When usingdevm_request_free_mem_region() and devm_memremap_pages() to add ZONE_DEVICEmemory, if requested free mem region's end pfn were huge(e.g.,0x400000000), the node_end_pfn() will be also huge (seemove_pfn_range_to_zone()). Thus it creates a huge hole betweennode_start_pfn() and node_end_pfn(). We found on some AMD APUs, amdkfdrequested such a free mem region and created a huge hole. In such a case,following code snippet was just doing busy test_bit() looping on the hugehole. for (pfn = start_pfn; pfn < end_pfn; pfn++) { struct page *page =pfn_to_online_page(pfn); if (!page) continue; ... } So we got a softlockup: watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#6 stuck for 26s!
