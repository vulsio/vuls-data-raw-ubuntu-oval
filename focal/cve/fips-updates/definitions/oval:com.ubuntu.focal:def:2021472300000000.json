		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:x86: Immediately reset the MMU context when the SMM flag is clearedImmediately reset the MMU context when the vCPU's SMM flag is cleared sothat the SMM flag in the MMU role is always synchronized with the vCPU'sflag. If RSM fails (which isn't correctly emulated), KVM will bail withoutcalling post_leave_smm() and leave the MMU in a bad state. The bad MMU rolecan lead to a NULL pointer dereference when grabbing a shadow page's rmapfor a page fault as the initial lookups for the gfn will happen with thevCPU's SMM flag (=0), whereas the rmap lookup will use the shadow page'sSMM flag, which comes from the MMU (=1). SMM has an entirely different setof memslots, and so the initial lookup can find a memslot (SMM=0) and thenexplode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1). general protection fault,probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPTSMP KASAN KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range[0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007] CPU: 1 PID: 8410 Comm:syz-executor382 Not tainted 5.13.0-rc5-syzkaller #0 Hardware name: GoogleGoogle Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/01/2011 RIP:0010:__gfn_to_rmap arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:935 [inline] RIP:0010:gfn_to_rmap+0x2b0/0x4d0 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:947 Code: <42> 80 3c 2000 74 08 4c 89 ff e8 f1 79 a9 00 4c 89 fb 4d 8b 37 44 RSP:0018:ffffc90000ffef98 EFLAGS: 00010246 RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX:ffff888015b9f414 RCX: ffff888019669c40 RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI:0000000000000001 RDI: 0000000000000001 RBP: 0000000000000001 R08:ffffffff811d9cdb R09: ffffed10065a6002 R10: ffffed10065a6002 R11:0000000000000000 R12: dffffc0000000000 R13: 0000000000000003 R14:0000000000000001 R15: 0000000000000000 FS: 000000000124b300(0000)GS:ffff8880b9b00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS: 0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000028e31000 CR4:00000000001526e0 DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2:0000000000000000 DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7:0000000000000400 Call Trace: rmap_add arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:965 [inline]mmu_set_spte+0x862/0xe60 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2604 __direct_maparch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2862 [inline] direct_page_fault+0x1f74/0x2b70arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:3769 kvm_mmu_do_page_fault arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h:124[inline] kvm_mmu_page_fault+0x199/0x1440 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:5065vmx_handle_exit+0x26/0x160 arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:6122vcpu_enter_guest+0x3bdd/0x9630 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9428 vcpu_run+0x416/0xc20arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9494 kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x4e8/0xa40arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9722 kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x70f/0xbb0arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:3460 vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51[inline] __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:1069 [inline] __se_sys_ioctl+0xfb/0x170fs/ioctl.c:1055 do_syscall_64+0x3f/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:47entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae RIP: 0033:0x440ce9\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47230` to fix the vulnerability.
