		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: Call iso_exit() on module unloadIf iso_init() has been called, iso_exit() must be called on moduleunload. Without that, the struct proto that iso_init() registered withproto_register() becomes invalid, which could cause unpredictableproblems later. In my case, with CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED andCONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION enabled, loading the module again usuallytriggers this BUG():  list_add corruption. next->prev should be prev (ffffffffb5355fd0),    but was 0000000000000068.
