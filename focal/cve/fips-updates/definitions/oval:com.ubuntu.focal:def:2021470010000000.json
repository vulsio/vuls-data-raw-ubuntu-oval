		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xprtrdma: Fix cwnd update ordering After a reconnect, the reply handler isopening the cwnd (and thus enabling more RPC Calls to be sent) /before/rpcrdma_post_recvs() can post enough Receive WRs to receive their replies.This causes an RNR and the new connection is lost immediately. The race ismost clearly exposed when KASAN and disconnect injection are enabled. Thisslows down rpcrdma_rep_create() enough to allow the send side to post abunch of RPC Calls before the Receive completion handler can invokeib_post_recv().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47001` to fix the vulnerability.
