Furtheranalysis confirmed that it is because the CPU online processing forosnoise is implemented through workers, which is asynchronous with theoffline processing. When the worker was scheduled to create a thread, theCPU may has already been removed from the cpu_online_mask during theofflineprocess, resulting in the inability to select the right CPU:T1                       | T2[CPUHP_ONLINE]           | cpu_device_down()osnoise_hotplug_workfn() |                         |     cpus_write_lock()                         |     takedown_cpu(1)                         |     cpus_write_unlock()[CPUHP_OFFLINE]          |    cpus_read_lock()     |    start_kthread(1)     |    cpus_read_unlock()   |To fix this, skip online processing if the CPU is already offline.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-49866` to fix the vulnerability.
