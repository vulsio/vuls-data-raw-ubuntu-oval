		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:s390: vsie: fix race during shadow creation Right now it is possible to seegmap->private being zero in kvm_s390_vsie_gmap_notifier resulting in acrash. This is due to the fact that we add gmap->private == kvm aftercreation: static int acquire_gmap_shadow(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, structvsie_page *vsie_page) { [...] gmap = gmap_shadow(vcpu->arch.gmap, asce,edat); if (IS_ERR(gmap)) return PTR_ERR(gmap); gmap->private = vcpu->kvm;Let children inherit the private field of the parent.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52639` to fix the vulnerability.
