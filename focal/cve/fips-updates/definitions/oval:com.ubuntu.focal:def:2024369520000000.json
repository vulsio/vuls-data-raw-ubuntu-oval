		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up Thereare cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believes theNPIV is logged into the fabric. This occurs when a vport is unregisteredbefore the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the fabric.Currently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDsincluding the fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees thendlp rport object. This sometimes causes the race condition where the finalDA_ID and LOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch. Fix bymoving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID andLOGO are sent.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36952` to fix the vulnerability.
