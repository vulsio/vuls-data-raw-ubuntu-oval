		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Use raw_spinlock_t in ringbufThe function __bpf_ringbuf_reserve is invoked from a tracepoint, whichdisables preemption. Using spinlock_t in this context can lead to a\"sleep in atomic\" warning in the RT variant. This issue is illustratedin the example below:BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context atkernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 556208, name:test_progspreempt_count: 1, expected: 0RCU nest depth: 1, expected: 1INFO: lockdep is turned off.Preemption disabled at:[<ffffd33a5c88ea44>] migrate_enable+0xc0/0x39cCPU: 7 PID: 556208 Comm: test_progs Tainted: GHardware name: Qualcomm SA8775P Ride (DT)Call trace: dump_backtrace+0xac/0x130 show_stack+0x1c/0x30 dump_stack_lvl+0xac/0xe8 dump_stack+0x18/0x30 __might_resched+0x3bc/0x4fc rt_spin_lock+0x8c/0x1a4 __bpf_ringbuf_reserve+0xc4/0x254 bpf_ringbuf_reserve_dynptr+0x5c/0xdc bpf_prog_ac3d15160d62622a_test_read_write+0x104/0x238 trace_call_bpf+0x238/0x774 perf_call_bpf_enter.isra.0+0x104/0x194 perf_syscall_enter+0x2f8/0x510 trace_sys_enter+0x39c/0x564 syscall_trace_enter+0x220/0x3c0 do_el0_svc+0x138/0x1dc el0_svc+0x54/0x130 el0t_64_sync_handler+0x134/0x150 el0t_64_sync+0x17c/0x180Switch the spinlock to raw_spinlock_t to avoid this error.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50138` to fix the vulnerability.
