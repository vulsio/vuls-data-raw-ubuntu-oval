		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: adapt set backend to use GC transaction APIUse the GC transaction API to replace the old and buggy gc API and thebusy mark approach.No set elements are removed from async garbage collection anymore,instead the _DEAD bit is set on so the set element is not visible fromlookup path anymore. Async GC enqueues transaction work that might beaborted and retried later.rbtree and pipapo set backends does not set on the _DEAD bit from thesync GC path since this runs in control plane path where mutex is held.In this case, set elements are deactivated, removed and then releasedvia RCU callback, sync GC never fails.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52923` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-fips - 5.4.0-1094.104\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1094-fips - 5.4.0-1094.104\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1120-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1120.130+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1120-aws-fips - 5.4.0-1120.130+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1126-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1126.133+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1126-azure-fips - 5.4.0-1126.133+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1124-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1124.133+fips1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-5.4.0-1124-gcp-fips - 5.4.0-1124.133+fips1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
