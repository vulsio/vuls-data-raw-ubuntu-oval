		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOTIn qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumedto be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's validto create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff:Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an activeclass list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingressqdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parentTC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when ahierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call intoqdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).In the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the treelevels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then theiteration must stop. net/sched/sch_api.c | 2 +- 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53057` to fix the vulnerability.
