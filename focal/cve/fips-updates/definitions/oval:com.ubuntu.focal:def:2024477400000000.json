		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:f2fs: Require FMODE_WRITE for atomic write ioctlsThe F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check forinode_owner_or_capable(), but this does not give LSMs like SELinux orLandlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUIDmatches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to writeparticular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but thiscan currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways: - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can   truncate an inode to size 0 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert   changes another process concurrently made to a fileFix it by requiring FMODE_WRITE for these operations, just like forF2FS_IOC_MOVE_RANGE. Since any legitimate caller should only be using theseioctls when intending to write into the file, that seems unlikely to breakanything.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47740` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-127-generic - 5.15.0-127.137~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-127-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-127.137~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-127-generic - 5.15.0-127.137~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-127-generic-64k - 5.15.0-127.137~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1073-aws - 5.15.0-1073.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1072-gcp - 5.15.0-1072.80~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1066-ibm - 5.15.0-1066.69~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-127-lowlatency - 5.15.0-127.137~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-127-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-127.137~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1071-oracle - 5.15.0-1071.77~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
