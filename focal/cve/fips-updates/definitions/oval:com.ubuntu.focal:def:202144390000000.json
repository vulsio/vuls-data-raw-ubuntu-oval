		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: isdn:cpai: check ctr->cnr to avoid array index out of bound Thecmtp_add_connection() would add a cmtp session to a controller and run akernel thread to process cmtp. __module_get(THIS_MODULE); session->task =kthread_run(cmtp_session, session, \"kcmtpd_ctr_%d\", session->num); Duringthis process, the kernel thread would call detach_capi_ctr() to detach aregister controller. if the controller was not attached yet,detach_capi_ctr() would trigger an array-index-out-bounds bug.
