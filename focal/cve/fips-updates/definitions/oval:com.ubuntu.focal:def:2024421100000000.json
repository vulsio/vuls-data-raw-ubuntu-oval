However __netif_rx() can only be called from interrupt context.Change the call to netif_rx() in order to allow completion via normalcontext for dmaengine drivers that utilize threaded irq handling.While the following commit changed from netif_rx() to __netif_rx(),baebdf48c360 (\"net: dev: Makes sure netif_rx() can be invoked in anycontext.\"),the change should've been a noop instead. However, the code precedes thisfix should've been using netif_rx_ni() or netif_rx_any_context().",
