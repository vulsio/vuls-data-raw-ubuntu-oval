		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bus:mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueue A recentchange created a dedicated workqueue for the state-change work withWQ_HIGHPRI (no strong reason for that) and WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags, but thestate-change work (mhi_pm_st_worker) does not guarantee forward progressunder memory pressure, and will even wait on various memory allocationswhen e.g. creating devices, loading firmware, etc... The work is then notpart of a memory reclaim path... Moreover, this causes a warning incheck_flush_dependency() since we end up in code that flushes a non-reclaimworkqueue: [ 40.969601] workqueue: WQ_MEM_RECLAIMmhi_hiprio_wq:mhi_pm_st_worker [mhi] is flushing !WQ_MEM_RECLAIMevents_highpri:flush_backlog [ 40.969612] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 158 atkernel/workqueue.c:2607 check_flush_dependency+0x11c/0x140 [ 40.969733]Call Trace: [ 40.969740] __flush_work+0x97/0x1d0 [ 40.969745] ?wake_up_process+0x15/0x20 [ 40.969749] ? insert_work+0x70/0x80 [ 40.969750]? __queue_work+0x14a/0x3e0 [ 40.969753] flush_work+0x10/0x20 [ 40.969756]rollback_registered_many+0x1c9/0x510 [ 40.969759]unregister_netdevice_queue+0x94/0x120 [ 40.969761]unregister_netdev+0x1d/0x30 [ 40.969765] mhi_net_remove+0x1a/0x40 [mhi_net][ 40.969770] mhi_driver_remove+0x124/0x250 [mhi] [ 40.969776]device_release_driver_internal+0xf0/0x1d0 [ 40.969778]device_release_driver+0x12/0x20 [ 40.969782] bus_remove_device+0xe1/0x150 [40.969786] device_del+0x17b/0x3e0 [ 40.969791]mhi_destroy_device+0x9a/0x100 [mhi] [ 40.969796] ?mhi_unmap_single_use_bb+0x50/0x50 [mhi] [ 40.969799]device_for_each_child+0x5e/0xa0 [ 40.969804] mhi_pm_st_worker+0x921/0xf50[mhi]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46970` to fix the vulnerability.
