		"title": "CVE-2024-36953 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-updates 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: vgic-v2: Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr()vgic_v2_parse_attr() is responsible for finding the vCPU that matches theuser-provided CPUID, which (of course) may not be valid. If the ID isinvalid, kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() returns NULL, which isn't handled gracefully.Similar to the GICv3 uaccess flow, check that kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() actuallyreturns something and fail the ioctl if not.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36953` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-118-generic - 5.15.0-118.128~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-118-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-118.128~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-118-generic - 5.15.0-118.128~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-118-generic-64k - 5.15.0-118.128~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1067-aws - 5.15.0-1067.73~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1070-azure - 5.15.0-1070.79~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1070-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1070.79~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1066-gcp - 5.15.0-1066.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1050-gkeop - 5.15.0-1050.57~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1060-ibm - 5.15.0-1060.63~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1062-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1062.68~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-118-lowlatency - 5.15.0-118.128~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-118-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-118.128~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1065-oracle - 5.15.0-1065.71~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
