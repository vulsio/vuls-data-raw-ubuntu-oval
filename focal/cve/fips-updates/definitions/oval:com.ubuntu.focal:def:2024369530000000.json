		"title": "CVE-2024-36953 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-updates 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: vgic-v2: Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr()vgic_v2_parse_attr() is responsible for finding the vCPU that matches theuser-provided CPUID, which (of course) may not be valid. If the ID isinvalid, kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() returns NULL, which isn't handled gracefully.Similar to the GICv3 uaccess flow, check that kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() actuallyreturns something and fail the ioctl if not.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36953` to fix the vulnerability.
