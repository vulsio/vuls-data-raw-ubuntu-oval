		"description": "Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturnbefore version 4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect and relaypackets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it wasobserved that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS`value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently,`CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is ableto relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn islistening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also bereached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. Byusing the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will beable to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless`--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since thedefault configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturnadministrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. Theissue patched in version 4.5.2. As a workaround the addresses in theaddress block `0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be denied by defaultunless `--allow-loopback-peers` has been specified.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26262` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncoturn - 4.5.1.1-1.1ubuntu0.20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
