		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing: Free buffers when a used dynamic event is removedAfter 65536 dynamic events have been added and removed, the \"type\" fieldof the event then uses the first type number that is available (notcurrently used by other events). A type number is the identifier of thebinary blobs in the tracing ring buffer (known as events) to map them tologic that can parse the binary blob.The issue is that if a dynamic event (like a kprobe event) is traced andis in the ring buffer, and then that event is removed (because it isdynamic, which means it can be created and destroyed), if another dynamicevent is created that has the same number that new event's logic onparsing the binary blob will be used.To show how this can be an issue, the following can crash the kernel: # cd /sys/kernel/tracing # for i in `seq 65536`; do     echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 $arg1:u32' > kprobe_events # doneFor every iteration of the above, the writing to the kprobe_events willremove the old event and create a new one (with the same format) andincrease the type number to the next available on until the type numberreaches over 65535 which is the max number for the 16 bit type. After itreaches that number, the logic to allocate a new number simply looks forthe next available number. When an dynamic event is removed, that numberis then available to be reused by the next dynamic event created. That is,once the above reaches the max number, the number assigned to the event inthat loop will remain the same.Now that means deleting one dynamic event and created another will reusethe previous events type number. This is where bad things can happen.After the above loop finishes, the kprobes/foo event which reads thedo_sys_openat2 function call's first parameter as an integer. # echo 1 > kprobes/foo/enable # cat /etc/passwd > /dev/null # cat trace             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849603: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849620: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849838: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849880: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196 # echo 0 > kprobes/foo/enableNow if we delete the kprobe and create a new one that reads a string: # echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 +0($arg2):string' > kprobe_eventsAnd now we can the trace: # cat trace        sendmail-1942    [002] .....   530.136320: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=             cat-2046    [004] .....530.930817: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240)arg1=\"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\"             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930961: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240)arg1=\"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\"             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934278: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240)arg1=\"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\"             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934563: foo:(do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"???????????????????????????????????????---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-49006` to fix the vulnerability.
