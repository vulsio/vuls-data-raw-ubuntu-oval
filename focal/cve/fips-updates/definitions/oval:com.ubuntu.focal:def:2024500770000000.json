		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: ISO: Fix multiple init when debugfs is disabledIf bt_debugfs is not created successfully, which happens if eitherCONFIG_DEBUG_FS or CONFIG_DEBUG_FS_ALLOW_ALL is unset, then iso_init()returns early and does not set iso_inited to true. This means that asubsequent call to iso_init() will result in duplicate calls toproto_register(), bt_sock_register(), etc.With CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION enabled, theduplicate call to proto_register() triggers this BUG():  list_add double add: new=ffffffffc0b280d0, prev=ffffffffbab56250,    next=ffffffffc0b280d0.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:35!
