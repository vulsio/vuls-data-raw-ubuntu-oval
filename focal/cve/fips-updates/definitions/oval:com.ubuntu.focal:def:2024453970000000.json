		"description": "h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. When anHTTP request using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTTpackets is received and the IP-address-based access control is used, theaccess control does not detect and prohibit HTTP requests conveyed bypackets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers onthe network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwiserejected by the address-based access control. The vulnerability has beenaddressed in commit 15ed15a. Users may disable the use of TCP FastOpen andQUIC to mitigate the issue.",
