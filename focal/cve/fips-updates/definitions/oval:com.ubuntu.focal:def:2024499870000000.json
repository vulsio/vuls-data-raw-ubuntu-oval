		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpftool: Fix undefined behavior in qsort(NULL, 0, ...)When netfilter has no entry to display, qsort is called withqsort(NULL, 0, ...). This results in undefined behavior, as UBSanreports:net.c:827:2: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 1, which isdeclared to never be nullAlthough the C standard does not explicitly state whether calling qsortwith a NULL pointer when the size is 0 constitutes undefined behavior,Section 7.1.4 of the C standard (Use of library functions) mentions:\"Each of the following statements applies unless explicitly statedotherwise in the detailed descriptions that follow: If an argument to afunction has an invalid value (such as a value outside the domain ofthe function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program, ora null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when thecorresponding parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (afterpromotion) not expected by a function with variable number ofarguments, the behavior is undefined.\"To avoid this, add an early return when nf_link_info is NULL to preventcalling qsort with a NULL pointer.",
