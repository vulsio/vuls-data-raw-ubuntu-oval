		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't wait for tx queues if firmware is deadThere is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that wasrecently converted from just a message), that can be hit if wewait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,we can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.Don't call iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() in this case. While it couldbe a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do somemaintenance work that is not related to the firmware, so keep that partof the code running even when the firmware is not running.[edit commit message]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47672` to fix the vulnerability.
