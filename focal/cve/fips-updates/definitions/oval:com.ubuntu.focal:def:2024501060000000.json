		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateidThere is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegationsand a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat threadfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so itmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper listbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocationhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racingfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it callslist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) freesthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up notcalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegationbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists onthe file.Now, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding thatlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which endsup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to thefollowint use-after-free KASAN warning:kernel: ==================================================================kernel: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free innfsd_breaker_owns_lease+0x140/0x160 [nfsd]kernel: Read of size 8 at addr ffff0000e73cd0c8 by task nfsd/6205kernel:kernel: CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 6205 Comm: nfsd Kdump: loaded Not tainted6.11.0-rc7+ #9kernel: Hardware name: Apple Inc.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been puton the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need tomake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and actaccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list beforethe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to removeit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrivedbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the statefreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.Also, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,we need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it meansthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and thisdelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and notnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and thelack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",
