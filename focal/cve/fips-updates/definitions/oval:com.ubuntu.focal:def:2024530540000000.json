A large number of cpuset cgroups are deleted.2. Set cpu on and off repeatly.3. Set watchdog_thresh repeatly.The scripts can be obtained at LINK mentioned above the signature.The reason for this issue is cgroup_mutex and cpu_hotplug_lock areacquired in different tasks, which may lead to deadlock.It can lead to a deadlock through the following steps:1. A large number of cpusets are deleted asynchronously, which puts a   large number of cgroup_bpf_release works into system_wq. The max_active   of system_wq is WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256). Consequently, all active works are   cgroup_bpf_release works, and many cgroup_bpf_release works will be put   into inactive queue. As illustrated in the diagram, there are 256 (in   the acvtive queue) + n (in the inactive queue) works.2. Setting watchdog_thresh will hold cpu_hotplug_lock.read and put   smp_call_on_cpu work into system_wq. However step 1 has already filled   system_wq, 'sscs.work' is put into inactive queue. 'sscs.work' has   to wait until the works that were put into the inacvtive queue earlier   have executed (n cgroup_bpf_release), so it will be blocked for a while.3. Cpu offline requires cpu_hotplug_lock.write, which is blocked by step 2.4. Cpusets that were deleted at step 1 put cgroup_release works into   cgroup_destroy_wq. They are competing to get cgroup_mutex all the time.   When cgroup_metux is acqured by work at css_killed_work_fn, it will   call cpuset_css_offline, which needs to acqure cpu_hotplug_lock.read.   However, cpuset_css_offline will be blocked for step 3.5. At this moment, there are 256 works in active queue that are   cgroup_bpf_release, they are attempting to acquire cgroup_mutex, and as   a result, all of them are blocked. Consequently, sscs.work can not be   executed. Ultimately, this situation leads to four processes being   blocked, forming a deadlock.system_wq(step1)\t\tWatchDog(step2)\t\t\tcpuoffline(step3)\tcgroup_destroy_wq(step4)...2000+ cgroups deleted asyn256 actives + n inactives\t\t\t\t__lockup_detector_reconfigure\t\t\t\tP(cpu_hotplug_lock.read)\t\t\t\tput sscs.work into system_wq256 + n + 1(sscs.work)sscs.work wait to be executed\t\t\t\twarting sscs.work finish\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpercpu_down_write\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP(cpu_hotplug_lock.write)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t...blocking...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcss_killed_work_fn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP(cgroup_mutex)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcpuset_css_offline\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP(cpu_hotplug_lock.read)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t...blocking...256 cgroup_bpf_releasemutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex);..blocking...To fix the problem, place cgroup_bpf_release works on a dedicatedworkqueue which can break the loop and solve the problem.
