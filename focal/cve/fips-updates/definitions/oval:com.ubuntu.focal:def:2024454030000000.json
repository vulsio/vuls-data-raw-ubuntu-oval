		"description": "h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. Whenh2o is configured as a reverse proxy and HTTP/3 requests are cancelled bythe client, h2o might crash due to an assertion failure. The crash can beexploited by an attacker to mount a Denial-of-Service attack. By default,the h2o standalone server automatically restarts, minimizing the impact.However, HTTP requests that were served concurrently will still bedisrupted. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 1ed32b2. Usersmay disable the use of HTTP/3 to mitigate the issue.",
