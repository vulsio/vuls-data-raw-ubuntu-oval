		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().  \"\"\"  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null  before using it.  \"\"\"The commit 83fccfc3940c (\"inet: fix potential deadlock inreqsk_queue_unlink()\") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() notto call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced asmall race window.Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer willcontinue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timerexpiration, which is 63s by default.The scenario would be  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),     but del_timer_sync() is missed  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets  4. sk is close()d  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->skLet's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in mostuse cases.
