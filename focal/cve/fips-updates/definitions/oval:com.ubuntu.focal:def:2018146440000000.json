		"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including4.1.4. A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT canlead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It onlyarises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers forthat parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of themeta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSECvalidation will be answered with a ServFail.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-14644` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npdns-recursor - 4.2.0-6\nNo subscription required",
