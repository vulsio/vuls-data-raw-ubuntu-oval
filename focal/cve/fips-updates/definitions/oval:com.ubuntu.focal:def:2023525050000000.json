		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: phy:lynx-28g: serialize concurrent phy_set_mode_ext() calls to shared registersThe protocol converter configuration registers PCC8, PCCC, PCCD(implemented by the driver), as well as others, control protocol convertersfrom multiple lanes (each represented as a different struct phy). So, ifthere are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext() to lanes sharing thesame PCC register (either for the \"old\" or for the \"new\" protocol),corruption of the values programmed to hardware is possible, becauselynx_28g_rmw() has no locking. Add a spinlock in the struct lynx_28g_privshared by all lanes, and take the global spinlock from the phy_ops ::set_mode() implementation. There are no other callers which modify PCCregisters.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52505` to fix the vulnerability.
