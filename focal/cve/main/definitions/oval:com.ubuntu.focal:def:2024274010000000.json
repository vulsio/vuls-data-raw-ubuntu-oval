		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when fetchingpacket contents Ensure that packet_buffer_get respects the user_lengthprovided. If the length of the head packet exceeds the user_length,packet_buffer_get will now return 0 to signify to the user that no datawere read and a larger buffer size is required. Helps prevent user spaceoverflows.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27401` to fix the vulnerability.
