Such as two Type-C ports share oneirq. After the first port finished tcpci_register_port(), it may triggerinterrupt. However, if the interrupt comes by chance the 2nd port finishesdevm_request_threaded_irq(), the 2nd port interrupt handler will run atfirst. Then the above issue happens due to tcpci is still a NULL pointerin tcpci_irq() when dereference to regmap.  devm_request_threaded_irq()\t\t\t\t<-- port1 irq comes  disable_irq(client->irq);  tcpci_register_port()This will restore the logic to the state before commit (77e85107a771 \"usb:typec: tcpci: support edge irq\").However, moving tcpci_register_port() earlier creates a problem when useedge irq because tcpci_init() will be called beforedevm_request_threaded_irq(). The tcpci_init() writes the ALERT_MASK tothe hardware to tell it to start generating interrupts but we're not readyto deal with them yet, then the ALERT events may be missed and ALERT linewill not recover to high level forever. To avoid the issue, this will alsoset ALERT_MASK register after devm_request_threaded_irq() return.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-57914` to fix the vulnerability.
