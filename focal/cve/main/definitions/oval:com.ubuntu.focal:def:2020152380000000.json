		"description": "Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, theDhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone toan argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on thesystem configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled forversion 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the`org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheelgroup in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. Onsystems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to`ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down aninterface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd andwithout ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts bypassing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZnetwork object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-supportis enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action tousers that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15238` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nblueman - 2.1.2-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
