		"description": "A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to impropersanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass acontrolled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log.Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line andtrick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logsciting raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending thespoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This loggedstring is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, forexample, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that useTuned's D-Bus interface for such operations.",
