		"description": "A vulnerability was found in Samba where a delegated administrator withpermission to create objects in Active Directory can write to allattributes of the newly created object, including security-sensitiveattributes, even after the object's creation. This issue occurs because theadministrator owns the object due to the lack of an Access Control List(ACL) at the time of creation and later being recognized as the 'creatorowner.' The retained significant rights of the delegated administrator maynot be well understood, potentially leading to unintended privilegeescalation or security risks.",
