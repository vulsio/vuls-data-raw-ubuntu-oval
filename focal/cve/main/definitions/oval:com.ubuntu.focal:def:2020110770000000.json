		"title": "CVE-2020-11077 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a requestthrough a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to anotherunknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the clientadds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it asthe first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, andwhen processing the second request, send back a response that the proxydoes not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Pumato send another request for a different client, the second response fromthe first client will be sent to the second client. This is a similar butdifferent vulnerability from CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed inPuma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-11077` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npuma - 3.12.4-1ubuntu2+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
