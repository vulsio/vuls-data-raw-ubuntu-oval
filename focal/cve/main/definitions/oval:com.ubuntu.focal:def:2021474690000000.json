		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses Currently we have aglobal spi_add_lock which we take when adding new devices so that we cancheck that we're not trying to reuse a chip select that's alreadycontrolled. This means that if the SPI device is itself a SPI controllerand triggers the instantiation of further SPI devices we trigger a deadlockas we try to register and instantiate those devices while in the process ofdoing so for the parent controller and hence already holding the globalspi_add_lock. Since we only care about concurrency within a single SPI busmove the lock to be per controller, avoiding the deadlock. This can beeasily triggered in the case of spi-mux.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47469` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-gkeop - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-ibm - 5.15.0-1033.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
