		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fsdax: dax_unshare_iter needs to copy entire blocksThe code that copies data from srcmap to iomap in dax_unshare_iter isvery very broken, which bfoster's recent fsx changes have exposed.If the pos and len passed to dax_file_unshare are not aligned to anfsblock boundary, the iter pos and length in the _iter function willreflect this unalignment.dax_iomap_direct_access always returns a pointer to the start of thekmapped fsdax page, even if its pos argument is in the middle of thatpage.  This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter->pos is notaligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte inthe file as iter->pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to thewrong place.If iter->pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to apage, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate thedestination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentialitybecause we expose stale pmem contents.Fix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a pageboundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so thatwe always copy full blocks.We're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,so programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing theold memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.Be careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we stillneed to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we'reoperating on.",
