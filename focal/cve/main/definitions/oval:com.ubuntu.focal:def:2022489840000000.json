Whileslcan_netdev_close() (netdev side) calls flush_work(&sl->tx_work),slcan_close() (tty side) does not. So when the netdev is never set UP,but the tty is stuffed with bytes and forced to wakeup write, the workis scheduled, but never flushed.So add an additional flush_work() to slcan_close() to be sure the workis flushed under all circumstances.The Fixes commit below moved flush_work() from slcan_close() toslcan_netdev_close(). What was the rationale behind it? Maybe we candrop the one in slcan_netdev_close()?I see the same pattern in can327. So it perhaps needs the very same fix.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48984` to fix the vulnerability.
