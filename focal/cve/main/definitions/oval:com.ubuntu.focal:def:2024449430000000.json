We are guaranteedto have at least one stable reference in slow path, so the simple atomicaddcould be used.  The performance difference should be trivial, but themisuse may be confusing and misleading.Redefined try_grab_folio() to try_grab_folio_fast(), and try_grab_page()to try_grab_folio(), and use them in the proper paths.  This solves boththe abuse and the kernel warning.The proper naming makes their usecase more clear and should prevent fromabusing in the future.peterx said:: The user will see the pin fails, for gpu-slow it further triggers theWARN: right below that failure (as in the original report):::         folio = try_grab_folio(page, page_increm - 1,:                                 foll_flags);:         if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!folio)) { <------------------------ here:                 /*:                         * Release the 1st page ref if the:                         * folio is problematic, fail hard.:                         */:                 gup_put_folio(page_folio(page), 1,:                                 foll_flags);:                 ret = -EFAULT;:                 goto out;:         }[1]https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1719478388-31917-1-git-send-email-yangge1116@126.com/[shy828301@gmail.com: fix implicit declaration of functiontry_grab_folio_fast]  Link:https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAHbLzkowMSso-4Nufc9hcMehQsK9PNz3OSu-+eniU-2Mm-xjhA@mail.gmail.com\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-44943` to fix the vulnerability.
