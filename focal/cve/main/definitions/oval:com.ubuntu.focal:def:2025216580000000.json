		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: avoid NULL pointer dereference if no valid extent tree[BUG]Syzbot reported a crash with the following call trace:  BTRFS info (device loop0): scrub: started on devid 1  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000208  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page  PGD 106e70067 P4D 106e70067 PUD 107143067 PMD 0  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 689 Comm: repro Kdump: loaded Tainted: G           O    6.13.0-rc4-custom+ #206  Tainted: [O]=OOT_MODULE  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS unknown02/02/2022  RIP: 0010:find_first_extent_item+0x26/0x1f0 [btrfs]  Call Trace:   <TASK>   scrub_find_fill_first_stripe+0x13d/0x3b0 [btrfs]   scrub_simple_mirror+0x175/0x260 [btrfs]   scrub_stripe+0x5d4/0x6c0 [btrfs]   scrub_chunk+0xbb/0x170 [btrfs]   scrub_enumerate_chunks+0x2f4/0x5f0 [btrfs]   btrfs_scrub_dev+0x240/0x600 [btrfs]   btrfs_ioctl+0x1dc8/0x2fa0 [btrfs]   ? do_sys_openat2+0xa5/0xf0   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x97/0xc0   do_syscall_64+0x4f/0x120   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e   </TASK>[CAUSE]The reproducer is using a corrupted image where extent tree root iscorrupted, thus forcing to use \"rescue=all,ro\" mount option to mount theimage.Then it triggered a scrub, but since scrub relies on extent tree to findwhere the data/metadata extents are, scrub_find_fill_first_stripe()relies on an non-empty extent root.But unfortunately scrub_find_fill_first_stripe() doesn't really expectan NULL pointer for extent root, it use extent_root to grab fs_info andtriggered a NULL pointer dereference.[FIX]Add an extra check for a valid extent root at the beginning ofscrub_find_fill_first_stripe().The new error path is introduced by 42437a6386ff (\"btrfs: introducemount option rescue=ignorebadroots\"), but that's pretty old, and latercommit b979547513ff (\"btrfs: scrub: introduce helper to find and fillsector info for a scrub_stripe\") changed how we do scrub.So for kernels older than 6.6, the fix will need manual backport.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2025-21658` to fix the vulnerability.
