		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Fix memory leak when changing remote IPv6 addressThe device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation inlinear memory that is managed by the driver.Changing the remote address of an ip6gre net device never workedproperly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] wouldresult in a warning [2] and a memory leak [3]. The problem is that thenew remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (andtherefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it.Fix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6grenet device changes and removing the old one. If the address did notchange, then the above would result in increasing the reference count ofthe address and then decreasing it.[1] # ip link add name bla up type ip6gre local 2001:db8:1::1 remote2001:db8:2::1 tos inherit ttl inherit # ip link set dev bla type ip6gre remote 2001:db8:3::1 # ip link del dev bla # devlink dev reload pci/0000:01:00.0[2]WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1682 atdrivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum.c:3002mlxsw_sp_ipv6_addr_put+0x140/0x1d0Modules linked in:CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1682 Comm: ip Not tainted6.12.0-rc3-custom-g86b5b55bc835 #151Hardware name: Nvidia SN5600/VMOD0013, BIOS 5.13 05/31/2023RIP: 0010:mlxsw_sp_ipv6_addr_put+0x140/0x1d0[...]Call Trace: <TASK> mlxsw_sp_router_netdevice_event+0x55f/0x1240 notifier_call_chain+0x5a/0xd0 call_netdevice_notifiers_info+0x39/0x90 unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x63e/0x9d0 rtnl_dellink+0x16b/0x3a0 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x142/0x3f0 netlink_rcv_skb+0x50/0x100 netlink_unicast+0x242/0x390 netlink_sendmsg+0x1de/0x420 ____sys_sendmsg+0x2bd/0x320 ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0 __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xd0 do_syscall_64+0x9e/0x1a0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f[3]unreferenced object 0xffff898081f597a0 (size 32):  comm \"ip\", pid 1626, jiffies 4294719324  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    20 01 0d b8 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01   ...............    21 49 61 83 80 89 ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  !Ia.............  backtrace (crc fd9be911):    [<00000000df89c55d>] __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x1da/0x260    [<00000000ff2a1ddb>] mlxsw_sp_ipv6_addr_kvdl_index_get+0x281/0x340    [<000000009ddd445d>] mlxsw_sp_router_netdevice_event+0x47b/0x1240    [<00000000743e7757>] notifier_call_chain+0x5a/0xd0    [<000000007c7b9e13>] call_netdevice_notifiers_info+0x39/0x90    [<000000002509645d>] register_netdevice+0x5f7/0x7a0    [<00000000c2e7d2a9>] ip6gre_newlink_common.isra.0+0x65/0x130    [<0000000087cd6d8d>] ip6gre_newlink+0x72/0x120    [<000000004df7c7cc>] rtnl_newlink+0x471/0xa20    [<0000000057ed632a>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x142/0x3f0    [<0000000032e0d5b5>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x50/0x100    [<00000000908bca63>] netlink_unicast+0x242/0x390    [<00000000cdbe1c87>] netlink_sendmsg+0x1de/0x420    [<0000000011db153e>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x2bd/0x320    [<000000003b6d53eb>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0    [<00000000cae27c62>] __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xd0\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50252` to fix the vulnerability.
