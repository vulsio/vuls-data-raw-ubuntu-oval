		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: enetc: Do not configure preemptible TCs if SIs do not supportBoth ENETC PF and VF drivers share enetc_setup_tc_mqprio() to configureMQPRIO. And enetc_setup_tc_mqprio() calls enetc_change_preemptible_tcs()to configure preemptible TCs. However, only PF is able to configurepreemptible TCs. Because only PF has related registers, while VF does nothave these registers. So for VF, its hw->port pointer is NULL. Therefore,VF will access an invalid pointer when accessing a non-existent register,which will cause a crash issue. The simplified log is as follows.root@ls1028ardb:~# tc qdisc add dev eno0vf0 parent root handle 100: \\mqprio num_tc 4 map 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 hw 1[  187.290775] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address0000000000001f00[  187.424831] pc : enetc_mm_commit_preemptible_tcs+0x1c4/0x400[  187.430518] lr : enetc_mm_commit_preemptible_tcs+0x30c/0x400[  187.511140] Call trace:[  187.513588]  enetc_mm_commit_preemptible_tcs+0x1c4/0x400[  187.518918]  enetc_setup_tc_mqprio+0x180/0x214[  187.523374]  enetc_vf_setup_tc+0x1c/0x30[  187.527306]  mqprio_enable_offload+0x144/0x178[  187.531766]  mqprio_init+0x3ec/0x668[  187.535351]  qdisc_create+0x15c/0x488[  187.539023]  tc_modify_qdisc+0x398/0x73c[  187.542958]  rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x128/0x378[  187.547064]  netlink_rcv_skb+0x60/0x130[  187.550910]  rtnetlink_rcv+0x18/0x24[  187.554492]  netlink_unicast+0x300/0x36c[  187.558425]  netlink_sendmsg+0x1a8/0x420[  187.606759] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---In addition, some PFs also do not support configuring preemptible TCs,such as eno1 and eno3 on LS1028A.
