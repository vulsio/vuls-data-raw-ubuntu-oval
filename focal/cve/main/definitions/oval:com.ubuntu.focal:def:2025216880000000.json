		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fenceIn commit e4b5ccd392b9 (\"drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULLafter job completion\"), we introduced a change to assign the job pointerto NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.However, this approach created a race condition between the DRMscheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence issignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets thejob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assignsa new job to the pointer.This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assignsit to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits aninterrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.[  466.310099] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtualaddress 00000000000000c0[  466.318928] Mem abort info:[  466.321723]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005[  466.325479]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits[  466.330807]   SET = 0, FnV = 0[  466.333864]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0[  466.337010]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault[  466.341900] Data abort info:[  466.344783]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000[  466.350285]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0[  466.355350]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0[  466.360677] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000089772000[  466.367140] [00000000000000c0] pgd=0000000000000000,p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000[  466.375875] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP[  466.382163] Modules linked in: rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer snd_seqsnd_seq_device algif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg bnep binfmt_misc vc4snd_soc_hdmi_codec drm_display_helper cec brcmfmac_wcc spidevrpivid_hevc(C) drm_client_lib brcmfmac hci_uart drm_dma_helper pisp_bebtbcm brcmutil snd_soc_core aes_ce_blk v4l2_mem2mem bluetooth aes_ce_ciphersnd_compress videobuf2_dma_contig ghash_ce cfg80211 gf128mulsnd_pcm_dmaengine videobuf2_memops ecdh_generic sha2_ce ecc videobuf2_v4l2snd_pcm v3d sha256_arm64 rfkill videodev snd_timer sha1_ce libaes gpu_schedsnd videobuf2_common sha1_generic drm_shmem_helper mc rp1_piodrm_kms_helper raspberrypi_hwmon spi_bcm2835 gpio_keys i2c_brcmstb rp1raspberrypi_gpiomem rp1_mailbox rp1_adc nvmem_rmem uio_pdrv_genirq uioi2c_dev drm ledtrig_pattern drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight fusedm_mod ip_tables x_tables ipv6[  466.458429] CPU: 0 UID: 1000 PID: 2008 Comm: chromium Tainted: GC         6.13.0-v8+ #18[  466.467336] Tainted: [C]=CRAP[  466.470306] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)[  466.476157] pstate: 404000c9 (nZcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBSBTYPE=--)[  466.483143] pc : v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d][  466.487258] lr : __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x60/0x228[  466.492327] sp : ffffffc080003ea0[  466.495646] x29: ffffffc080003ea0 x28: ffffff80c0c94200 x27:0000000000000000[  466.502807] x26: ffffffd08dd81d7b x25: ffffff80c0c94200 x24:ffffff8003bdc200[  466.509969] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 00000000000000a7 x21:0000000000000000[  466.517130] x20: ffffff8041bb0000 x19: 0000000000000001 x18:0000000000000000[  466.524291] x17: ffffffafadfb0000 x16: ffffffc080000000 x15:0000000000000000[  466.531452] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12:0000000000000000[  466.538613] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 :ffffffd08c527eb0[  466.545777] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 :0000000000000000[  466.552941] x5 : ffffffd08c4100d0 x4 : ffffffafadfb0000 x3 :ffffffc080003f70[  466.560102] x2 : ffffffc0829e8058 x1 : 0000000000000001 x0 :0000000000000000[  466.567263] Call trace:[  466.569711]  v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d] (P)[  466.---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2025-21688` to fix the vulnerability.
