		"title": "CVE-2024-53141 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: ipset: add missing range check in bitmap_ip_uadtWhen tb[IPSET_ATTR_IP_TO] is not present but tb[IPSET_ATTR_CIDR] exists,the values of ip and ip_to are slightly swapped. Therefore, the range checkfor ip should be done later, but this part is missing and it seems that thevulnerability occurs.So we should add missing range checks and remove unnecessary range checks.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53141` to fix the vulnerability.
