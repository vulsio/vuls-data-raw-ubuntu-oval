In theperformance test scenario, function irq_wait_for_interrupt() will alwaysreturn 0 if lots of interrupts occurs and the CPU will be continuouslyconsumed. As a result, the CPU cannot run the watchdog thread. When thewatchdog time exceeds the specified time, call trace occurs.To fix it, add cond_resched() to execute the watchdog thread.",
