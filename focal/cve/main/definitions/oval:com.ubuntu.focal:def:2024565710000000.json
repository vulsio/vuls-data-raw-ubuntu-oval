		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: uvcvideo: Require entities to have a non-zero unique IDPer UVC 1.1+ specification 3.7.2, units and terminals must have a non-zerounique ID.```Each Unit and Terminal within the video function is assigned a uniqueidentification number, the Unit ID (UID) or Terminal ID (TID), contained inthe bUnitID or bTerminalID field of the descriptor. The value 0x00 isreserved for undefined ID,```So, deny allocating an entity with ID 0 or an ID that belongs to a unitthat is already added to the list of entities.This also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings dueto a chain of entities referring to themselves. In one particular case, anOutput Unit is connected to an Input Unit, both with the same ID of 1. Butwhen looking up for the source ID of the Output Unit, that same entity isfound instead of the input entity, which leads to such warnings.In another case, a backward chain was considered finished as the source IDwas 0. Later on, that entity was found, but its pads were not valid.Here is a sample stack trace for one of those cases.[   20.650953] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using dummy_hcd[   20.830206] usb 1-1: Using ep0 maxpacket: 8[   20.833501] usb 1-1: config 0 descriptor??[   21.038518] usb 1-1: string descriptor 0 read error: -71[   21.038893] usb 1-1: Found UVC 0.00 device <unnamed> (2833:0201)[   21.039299] uvcvideo 1-1:0.0: Entity type for entity Output 1 was notinitialized![   21.041583] uvcvideo 1-1:0.0: Entity type for entity Input 1 was notinitialized![   21.042218] ------------[ cut here ]------------[   21.042536] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at drivers/media/mc/mc-entity.c:1147media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0[   21.043195] Modules linked in:[   21.043535] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 9 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted6.11.0-rc7-00030-g3480e43aeccf #444[   21.044101] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS1.15.0-1 04/01/2014[   21.044639] Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event[   21.045100] RIP: 0010:media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0[   21.045508] Code: fe e8 20 01 00 00 b8 f4 ff ff ff 48 83 c4 30 5b 41 5c41 5d 41 5e 41 5f 5d c3 cc cc cc cc 0f 0b eb e9 0f 0b eb 0a 0f 0b eb 06<0f> 0b eb 02 0f 0b b8 ea ff ff ff eb d4 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00[   21.046801] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000004b318 EFLAGS: 00010246[   21.047227] RAX: ffff888004e5d458 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX:ffffffff818fccf1[   21.047719] RDX: 000000000000007b RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI:ffff888004313290[   21.048241] RBP: ffff888004313290 R08: 0001ffffffffffff R09:0000000000000000[   21.048701] R10: 0000000000000013 R11: 0001888004313290 R12:0000000000000003[   21.049138] R13: ffff888004313080 R14: ffff888004313080 R15:0000000000000000[   21.049648] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88803ec00000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000[   21.050271] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[   21.050688] CR2: 0000592cc27635b0 CR3: 000000000431c000 CR4:0000000000750ef0[   21.051136] PKRU: 55555554[   21.051331] Call Trace:[   21.051480]  <TASK>[   21.051611]  ? __warn+0xc4/0x210[   21.051861]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0[   21.052252]  ? report_bug+0x11b/0x1a0[   21.052540]  ? trace_hardirqs_on+0x31/0x40[   21.052901]  ? handle_bug+0x3d/0x70[   21.053197]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x50[   21.053511]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20[   21.053924]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x91/0x2e0[   21.054364]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x2c4/0x2e0[   21.054834]  ? media_create_pad_link+0x91/0x2e0[   21.055131]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1e/0x40[   21.055441]  ? __v4l2_device_register_subdev+0x202/0x210[   21.055837]  uvc_mc_register_entities+0x358/0x400[   21.056144]  uvc_register_chains+0x1fd/0x290[   21.056413]  uvc_probe+0x380e/0x3dc0[   21.056676]  ? __lock_acquire+0x5aa/0x26e0[   21.056946]  ? find_held_lock+0x33/0xa0[   21.057196]  ? kernfs_activate+0x70/0x80[   21.057533]  ? usb_match_dy---truncated---",
