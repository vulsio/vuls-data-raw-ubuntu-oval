If the mptcp worker (dumbly) triesmptcp-level re-injection after such ack, that would unconditionally triggera send buffer cleanup using 'bad' snd_una values. We could easily disablere-injection for fallback sockets, but such dumb behavior already helpedcatching a few subtle issues and a very low to zero impact in practice.Instead address the issue always initializing snd_nxt (and write_seq, forconsistency) at connect time.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36889` to fix the vulnerability.
