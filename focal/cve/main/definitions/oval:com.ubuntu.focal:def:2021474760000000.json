		"title": "CVE-2021-47476 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: comedi:ni_usb6501: fix NULL-deref in command paths The driver uses endpoint-sizedUSB transfer buffers but had no sanity checks on the sizes. This can leadto zero-size-pointer dereferences or overflowed transfer buffers inni6501_port_command() and ni6501_counter_command() if a (malicious) devicehas smaller max-packet sizes than expected (or when doing descriptor fuzztesting). Add the missing sanity checks to probe().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47476` to fix the vulnerability.
