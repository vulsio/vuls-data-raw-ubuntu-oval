		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: fix race in buffer_head read fault injectionWhen I enabled ext4 debug for fault injection testing, I encountered thefollowing warning:  EXT4-fs error (device sda): ext4_read_inode_bitmap:201: comm fsstress:         Cannot read inode bitmap - block_group = 8, inode_bitmap = 1051  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 511 at fs/buffer.c:1181mark_buffer_dirty+0x1b3/0x1d0The root cause of the issue lies in the improper implementation of ext4'sbuffer_head read fault injection. The actual completion of buffer_headread and the buffer_head fault injection are not atomic, which can leadto the uptodate flag being cleared on normally used buffer_heads in raceconditions.[CPU0]           [CPU1]         [CPU2]ext4_read_inode_bitmap  ext4_read_bh()  <bh read complete>                 ext4_read_inode_bitmap                   if (buffer_uptodate(bh))                     return bh                               jbd2_journal_commit_transaction                                 __jbd2_journal_refile_buffer                                   __jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer                                     __jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer  ext4_simulate_fail_bh()    clear_buffer_uptodate                                      mark_buffer_dirty                                        <report warning>                                        WARN_ON_ONCE(!buffer_uptodate(bh))The best approach would be to perform fault injection in the IO completioncallback function, rather than after IO completion. However, the IOcompletion callback function cannot get the fault injection code in sb.Fix it by passing the result of fault injection into the bh read function,we simulate faults within the bh read function itself. This requires addingan extra parameter to the bh read functions that need fault injection.",
