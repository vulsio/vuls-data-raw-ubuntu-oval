		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:parport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds accessThe recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns thewould-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the lengthcalculation can still go over the given limit.Use scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actuallyoutput letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds accessproperly.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50074` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1019.24~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required",
