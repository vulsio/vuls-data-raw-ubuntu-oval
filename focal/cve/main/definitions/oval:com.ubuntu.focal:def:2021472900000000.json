		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:target: Fix NULL dereference on XCOPY completion CPU affinity control addedwith commit 39ae3edda325 (\"scsi: target: core: Make completion affinityconfigurable\") makes target_complete_cmd() queue work on a CPU based onse_tpg->se_tpg_wwn->cmd_compl_affinity state. LIO's EXTENDED COPY worker isa special case in that read/write cmds are dispatched using the globalxcopy_pt_tpg, which carries a NULL se_tpg_wwn pointer followinginitialization in target_xcopy_setup_pt(). The NULLxcopy_pt_tpg->se_tpg_wwn pointer is dereferenced on completion of anyEXTENDED COPY initiated read/write cmds.
