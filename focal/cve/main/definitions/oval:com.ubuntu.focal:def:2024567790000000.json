		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occurThe action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task evenumount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentiallysend two rpc_task to nfs server.

If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is notmarked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Sincetwo rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from theclient to server, and because two instances of nfsd can runconcurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will betriggered.
