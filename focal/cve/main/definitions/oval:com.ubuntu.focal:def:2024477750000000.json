		"title": "CVE-2024-47775 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handlingcomponents. An OOB-read vulnerability has been found in the parse_ds64function within gstwavparse.c. The parse_ds64 function does not check thatthe buffer buf contains sufficient data before attempting to read from it,doing multiple GST_READ_UINT32_LE operations without performing boundarychecks. This can lead to an OOB-read when buf is smaller than expected.This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer,potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitivedata. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47775` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngstreamer1.0-gtk3 - 1.16.3-0ubuntu1.3\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-good - 1.16.3-0ubuntu1.3\ngstreamer1.0-pulseaudio - 1.16.3-0ubuntu1.3\ngstreamer1.0-qt5 - 1.16.3-0ubuntu1.3\nlibgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-0 - 1.16.3-0ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
