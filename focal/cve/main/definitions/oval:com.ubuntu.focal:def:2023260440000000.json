		"description": "react/http is an event-driven, streaming HTTP client and serverimplementation for ReactPHP. Previous versions of ReactPHP's HTTP servercomponent contain a potential DoS vulnerability that can cause high CPUload when processing large HTTP request bodies. This vulnerability haslittle to no impact on the default configuration, but can be exploited whenexplicitly using the RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with very large settings.This might lead to consuming large amounts of CPU time for processingrequests and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimateuser requests. This issue has been addressed in release 1.9.0. Users areadvised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may keep the request bodylimited using RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with a sensible value whichshould mitigate the issue. An infrastructure or DevOps workaround could beto place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter outany excessive HTTP request bodies.",
