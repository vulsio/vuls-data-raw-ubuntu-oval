		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfc: pn533: Add poll mod list filling checkIn case of im_protocols value is 1 and tm_protocols value is 0 thiscombination successfully passes the check'if (!im_protocols && !tm_protocols)' in the nfc_start_poll().But then after pn533_poll_create_mod_list() call in pn533_start_poll()poll mod list will remain empty and dev->poll_mod_count will remain 0which lead to division by zero.Normally no im protocol has value 1 in the mask, so this combination isnot expected by driver. But these protocol values actually come fromuserspace via Netlink interface (NFC_CMD_START_POLL operation). So abroken or malicious program may pass a message containing a \"bad\"combination of protocol parameter values so that dev->poll_mod_countis not incremented inside pn533_poll_create_mod_list(), thus leadingto division by zero.Call trace looks like:nfc_genl_start_poll()  nfc_start_poll()    ->start_poll()    pn533_start_poll()Add poll mod list filling check.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
