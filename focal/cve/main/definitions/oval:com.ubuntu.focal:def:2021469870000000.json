		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroups There are a fewexceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs to copy the inlineextent data into a page of the destination inode. When this happens, we endup starting a transaction while having a dirty page for the destinationinode and while having the range locked in the destination's inode iotreetoo. Because when reserving metadata space for a transaction we may need toflush existing delalloc in case there is not enough free space, we have amechanism in place to prevent a deadlock, which was introduced in commit3d45f221ce627d (\"btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extent and low onfree metadata space\"). However when using qgroups, a transaction alsoreserves metadata qgroup space, which can also result in flushing delallocin case there is not enough available space at the moment. When thishappens we deadlock, since flushing delalloc requires locking the filerange in the inode's iotree and the range was already locked at the verybeginning of the clone operation, before attempting to start thetransaction. When this issue happens, stack traces like the following arereported: [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9 state:D stack: 0 pid: 225 ppid:2 flags:0x00004000 [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn(flush-btrfs-1142) [72747.556271] Call Trace: [72747.556273]__schedule+0x296/0x760 [72747.556277] schedule+0x3c/0xa0 [72747.556279]io_schedule+0x12/0x40 [72747.556284] __lock_page+0x13c/0x280 [72747.556287]? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70 [72747.556325]extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs] [72747.556331] ?__set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160 [72747.556358] ?set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs] [72747.556362] ?update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210 [72747.556366] ?cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20 [72747.556391] extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0[btrfs] [72747.556394] do_writepages+0x41/0xd0 [72747.556398]__writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0 [72747.556403]writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440 [72747.556407]__writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0 [72747.556410] wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0[72747.556414] ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50 [72747.556417]wb_workfn+0x354/0x490 [72747.556420] ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0[72747.556424] process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340 [72747.556426]worker_thread+0x30/0x390 [72747.556429] ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0[72747.556432] kthread+0x116/0x130 [72747.556435] ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80[72747.556438] ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 [72747.566958] Workqueue:btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs] [72747.566961] Call Trace:[72747.566964] __schedule+0x296/0x760 [72747.566968] ?finish_wait+0x80/0x80 [72747.566970] schedule+0x3c/0xa0 [72747.566995]wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs] [72747.566999] ?finish_wait+0x80/0x80 [72747.567024] lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs][72747.567047] btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs] [72747.567051] ?find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380 [72747.567076]__extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs] [72747.567102]extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs] [72747.567106] ?update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0 [72747.567109] ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0[72747.567134] extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs] [72747.567137] ?enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0 [72747.567140] do_writepages+0x41/0xd0[72747.567144] __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100 [72747.567167]btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs] [72747.567195]btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs] [72747.567200]process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340 [72747.567202] worker_thread+0x30/0x390[72747.567205] ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0 [72747.567208]kthread+0x116/0x130 [72747.567211] ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80 [72747.567214]ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 [72747.569686] task:fsstress state:D stack:---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46987` to fix the vulnerability.
