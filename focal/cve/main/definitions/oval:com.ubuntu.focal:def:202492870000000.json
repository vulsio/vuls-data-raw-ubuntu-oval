		"description": "A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI wherepath names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quotedproperly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment\"activation\" scripts (ie \"source venv/bin/activate\"). This means thatattacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when thevirtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are notcreated by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie\"./venv/bin/python\") are not affected.",
