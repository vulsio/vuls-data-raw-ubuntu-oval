		"description": "PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificatebased user login. In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 modulesegfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN.When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize thepassword buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference anuninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The mostlikely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impactdue to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patchfor the issue is unavailable.",
