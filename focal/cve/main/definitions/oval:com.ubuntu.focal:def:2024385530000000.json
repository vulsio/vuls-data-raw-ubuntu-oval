		"title": "CVE-2024-38553 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fec: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks There is a deadlockissue found in sungem driver, please refer to the commit ac0a230f719b(\"eth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks\"). The rootcause of the issue is that netpoll is in atomic context and disable_irq()is called by .ndo_poll_controller interface of sungem driver, however,disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzing the implementation offec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should have the same issue. Due tothe fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the .ndo_poll_controller isunnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver, so fec_poll_controller()can be safely removed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38553` to fix the vulnerability.
