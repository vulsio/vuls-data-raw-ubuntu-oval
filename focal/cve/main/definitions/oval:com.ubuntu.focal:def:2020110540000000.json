		"description": "In qutebrowser versions less than 1.11.1, reloading a page with certificateerrors shows a green URL. After a certificate error was overridden by theuser, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow(colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website wassubsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green(colors.statusbar.url.success_https). While the user already has seen acertificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl_strict to false,which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense ofsecurity. This has been fixed in 1.11.1 and 1.12.0. All versions ofqutebrowser are believed to be affected, though versions before v0.11.xcouldn't be tested. Backported patches for older versions (greater than orequal to 1.4.0 and less than or equal to 1.10.2) are available, but nofurther releases are planned.",
