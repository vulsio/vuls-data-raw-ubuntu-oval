    "Title": "CVE-2022-1116 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - high.",
    "Description": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability in io_uring of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause memory corruption and escalate privileges to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.4.189; version 5.4.24 and later versions. Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained in integer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1116` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-lowlatency - 5.4.0-113.127\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-aws - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-azure - 5.4.0-1080.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1009-azure - 5.13.0-1009.10~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1080.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-bluefield - 5.4.0-1036.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-gcp - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-gcp - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-gke - 5.4.0-1072.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gkeop - 5.4.0-1043.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic-64k - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-lowlatency - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-ibm - 5.4.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1007-intel - 5.13.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-kvm - 5.4.0-1065.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-oracle - 5.4.0-1073.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-oracle - 5.13.0-1011.13~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1062-raspi - 5.4.0-1062.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-lowlatency - 5.4.0-113.127\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-1008-aws - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-azure - 5.4.0-1080.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1009-azure - 5.13.0-1009.10~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1080.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-bluefield - 5.4.0-1036.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-gcp - 5.4.0-1075.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1008-gcp - 5.13.0-1008.9~20.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-gke - 5.4.0-1072.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gkeop - 5.4.0-1043.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-21-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-generic-64k - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-21-lowlatency - 5.13.0-21.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-ibm - 5.4.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1007-intel - 5.13.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-kvm - 5.4.0-1065.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-oracle - 5.4.0-1073.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-oracle - 5.13.0-1011.13~20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
