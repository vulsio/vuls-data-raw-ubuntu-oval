		"Title": "CVE-2019-8324 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by code in ensure_loadable_spec during the preinstall check. It was discovered that RubyGems as embedded in JRuby did not properly handle multi-line gem names. If a user were tricked into installing a malicious gem, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-8324` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njruby - 9.1.17.0-3\nNo subscription required",
