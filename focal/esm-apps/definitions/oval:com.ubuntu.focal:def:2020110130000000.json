		"Title": "CVE-2020-11013 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - low",
		"Description": "Their is an information disclosure vulnerability in Helm from version 3.1.0and before version 3.2.0. `lookup` is a Helm template function introducedin Helm v3. It is able to lookup resources in the cluster to check for theexistence of specific resources and get details about them. This can beused as part of the process to render templates. The documented behavior of`helm template` states that it does not attach to a remote cluster.However, a the recently added `lookup` template function circumvents thisrestriction and connects to the cluster even during `helm template` and`helm install|update|delete|rollback --dry-run`. The user is not notifiedof this behavior. Running `helm template` should not make calls to acluster. This is different from `install`, which is presumed to have accessto a cluster in order to load resources into Kubernetes. Helm 2 isunaffected by this vulnerability. A malicious chart author could inject a`lookup` into a chart that, when rendered through `helm template`, performsunannounced lookups against the cluster a user&#39;s `KUBECONFIG` filepoints to. This information can then be disclosed via the output of `helmtemplate`. This issue has been fixed in Helm 3.2.0",
