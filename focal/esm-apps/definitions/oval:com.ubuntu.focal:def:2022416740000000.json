		"Title": "CVE-2022-41674 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19.16. Attackers able to inject WLAN frames could cause a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c. Sönke Huster discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41674` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbackport-iwlwifi-dkms - 8324-0ubuntu3~20.04.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-131-generic - 5.4.0-131.147\nlinux-image-5.4.0-131-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-131.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-131-generic - 5.4.0-131.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-131-lowlatency - 5.4.0-131.147\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1088-aws - 5.4.0-1088.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-aws - 5.15.0-1022.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-azure - 5.4.0-1094.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-azure - 5.15.0-1022.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1094.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1022.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-bluefield - 5.4.0-1049.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-gcp - 5.4.0-1092.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-gcp - 5.15.0-1021.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gke - 5.4.0-1086.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-gke - 5.15.0-1019.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gkeop - 5.4.0-1056.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-52-generic - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-52-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-generic - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-generic-64k - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-ibm - 5.4.0-1036.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-kvm - 5.4.0-1078.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-lowlatency - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1054-oem - 5.14.0-1054.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-oracle - 5.4.0-1086.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-oracle - 5.15.0-1021.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1073-raspi - 5.4.0-1073.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-131-generic - 5.4.0-131.147\nlinux-image-5.4.0-131-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-131.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-131-generic - 5.4.0-131.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-131-lowlatency - 5.4.0-131.147\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1088-aws - 5.4.0-1088.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-aws - 5.15.0-1022.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-azure - 5.4.0-1094.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1022-azure - 5.15.0-1022.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1094.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1022.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-bluefield - 5.4.0-1049.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-gcp - 5.4.0-1092.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-gcp - 5.15.0-1021.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gke - 5.4.0-1086.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1019-gke - 5.15.0-1019.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gkeop - 5.4.0-1056.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-52-generic - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-52-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-generic - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-generic-64k - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-ibm - 5.4.0-1036.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1018-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1018.23~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-kvm - 5.4.0-1078.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-lowlatency - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-52-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-52.58~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1054-oem - 5.14.0-1054.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-oracle - 5.4.0-1086.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1021-oracle - 5.15.0-1021.27~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
