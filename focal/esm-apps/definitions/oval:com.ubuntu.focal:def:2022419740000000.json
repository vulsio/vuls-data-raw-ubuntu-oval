		"Title": "CVE-2022-41974 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "multipath-tools 0.7.0 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root access, as exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This can lead to local privilege escalation to root. This occurs because an attacker can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled because arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41974` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nkpartx - 0.8.3-1ubuntu2.1\nkpartx-boot - 0.8.3-1ubuntu2.1\nmultipath-tools - 0.8.3-1ubuntu2.1\nmultipath-tools-boot - 0.8.3-1ubuntu2.1\nNo subscription required",
