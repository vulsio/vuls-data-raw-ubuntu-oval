    "Title": "CVE-2023-4004 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter in the way a user triggers the nft_pipapo_remove function with the element, without a NFT_SET_EXT_KEY_END. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle PIPAPO element removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4004` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-aws - 5.15.0-1043.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-bluefield - 5.4.0-1073.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-gcp - 5.15.0-1040.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gkeop - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-ibm - 5.15.0-1036.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-iot - 5.4.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-oracle - 5.15.0-1041.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1043-aws - 5.15.0-1043.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1045-azure - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1045.52~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-bluefield - 5.4.0-1073.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-gcp - 5.15.0-1040.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gkeop - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-82-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-generic-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-ibm - 5.15.0-1036.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1038.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-iot - 5.4.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-82-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-82.91~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-oracle - 5.15.0-1041.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1020-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1020.24\nNo subscription required",
