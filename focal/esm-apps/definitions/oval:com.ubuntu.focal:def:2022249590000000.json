    "Title": "CVE-2022-24959 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - negligible.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. It was discovered that the YAM AX.25 device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24959` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-109-generic - 5.4.0-109.123\nlinux-image-5.4.0-109-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-109.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-109-generic - 5.4.0-109.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-109-lowlatency - 5.4.0-109.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-aws - 5.4.0-1072.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-aws - 5.13.0-1022.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1077-azure - 5.4.0-1077.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-azure - 5.13.0-1022.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1077.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1035-bluefield - 5.4.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-gcp - 5.4.0-1072.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1024-gcp - 5.13.0-1024.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gke - 5.4.0-1068.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-gkeop - 5.4.0-1039.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic-64k - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-lowlatency - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-ibm - 5.4.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-intel - 5.13.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-kvm - 5.4.0-1062.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1024-oem - 5.14.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-oracle - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1027-oracle - 5.13.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1059-raspi - 5.4.0-1059.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-109-generic - 5.4.0-109.123\nlinux-image-5.4.0-109-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-109.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-109-generic - 5.4.0-109.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-109-lowlatency - 5.4.0-109.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-aws - 5.4.0-1072.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-aws - 5.13.0-1022.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1077-azure - 5.4.0-1077.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-azure - 5.13.0-1022.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1077.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1035-bluefield - 5.4.0-1035.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-gcp - 5.4.0-1072.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1024-gcp - 5.13.0-1024.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gke - 5.4.0-1068.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-gkeop - 5.4.0-1039.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic-64k - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-lowlatency - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-ibm - 5.4.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-intel - 5.13.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-kvm - 5.4.0-1062.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1024-oem - 5.14.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-oracle - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1027-oracle - 5.13.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
