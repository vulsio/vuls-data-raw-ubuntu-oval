    "Title": "CVE-2021-3603 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "PHPMailer 6.4.1 and earlier contain a vulnerability that can result in untrusted code being called (if such code is injected into the host project's scope by other means). If the $patternselect parameter to validateAddress() is set to 'php' (the default, defined by PHPMailer::$validator), and the global namespace contains a function called php, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same name. Mitigated in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as validator function names.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3603` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibphp-phpmailer - 6.0.6-0.1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
