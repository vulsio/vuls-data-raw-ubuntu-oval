    "Title": "CVE-2021-44879 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "In gc_data_segment in fs/f2fs/gc.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.3, special files are not considered, leading to a move_data_page NULL pointer dereference. Wenqing Liu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inode types while performing garbage collection. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-44879` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-aws - 5.13.0-1022.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-azure - 5.13.0-1022.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1024-gcp - 5.13.0-1024.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic-64k - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-lowlatency - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-intel - 5.13.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1024-oem - 5.14.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1027-oracle - 5.13.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-aws - 5.13.0-1022.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1022-azure - 5.13.0-1022.26~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1024-gcp - 5.13.0-1024.29~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-generic-64k - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-40-lowlatency - 5.13.0-40.45~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1011-intel - 5.13.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1024-oem - 5.14.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1027-oracle - 5.13.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
