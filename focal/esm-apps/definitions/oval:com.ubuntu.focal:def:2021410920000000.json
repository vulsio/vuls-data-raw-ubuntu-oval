		"description": "Docker CLI is the command line interface for the docker container runtime.A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker loginmy-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file(typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers`that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials beingsent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry.This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. Users should update to thisversion as soon as possible. For users unable to update ensure that anyconfigured credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration filereference an installed credential helper that is executable and on thePATH.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41092` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndocker.io - 20.10.7-0ubuntu5~20.04.2\nNo subscription required",
