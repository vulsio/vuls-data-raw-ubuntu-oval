    "Title": "CVE-2021-45480 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of circumstances. It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-45480` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-aws - 5.4.0-1069.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1019-aws - 5.13.0-1019.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-azure - 5.4.0-1073.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1021-azure - 5.13.0-1021.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1073.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-bluefield - 5.4.0-1032.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gcp - 5.4.0-1068.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1021-gcp - 5.13.0-1021.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gke - 5.4.0-1066.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gkeop - 5.4.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-37-generic - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-37-generic - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-37-generic-64k - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-37-lowlatency - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-kvm - 5.4.0-1059.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1022-oem - 5.14.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-oracle - 5.4.0-1067.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1025-oracle - 5.13.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1056-raspi - 5.4.0-1056.63\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-aws - 5.4.0-1069.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1019-aws - 5.13.0-1019.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-azure - 5.4.0-1073.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1021-azure - 5.13.0-1021.24~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1073.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-bluefield - 5.4.0-1032.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gcp - 5.4.0-1068.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1021-gcp - 5.13.0-1021.25~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gke - 5.4.0-1066.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gkeop - 5.4.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.13.0-37-generic - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.13.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-37-generic - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-37-generic-64k - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-37-lowlatency - 5.13.0-37.42~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-kvm - 5.4.0-1059.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1022-oem - 5.14.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-oracle - 5.4.0-1067.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.13.0-1025-oracle - 5.13.0-1025.30~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
