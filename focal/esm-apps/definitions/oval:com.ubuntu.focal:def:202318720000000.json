		"Title": "CVE-2023-1872 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring system can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The io_file_get_fixed function lacks the presence of ctx->uring_lock which can lead to a Use-After-Free vulnerability due a race condition with fixed files getting unregistered. We recommend upgrading past commit da24142b1ef9fd5d36b76e36bab328a5b27523e8. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1872` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-aws - 5.15.0-1035.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-azure - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gcp - 5.15.0-1033.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gke - 5.15.0-1032.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-oracle - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1007-raspi - 5.4.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-5.4.0-9-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-generic - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-lowlatency - 5.4.0-9.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-9-snapdragon - 5.4.0-9.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1005-aws - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1035-aws - 5.15.0-1035.39~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1006-azure - 5.4.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-azure - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1037.44~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-bluefield - 5.4.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-gcp - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-gcp - 5.15.0-1033.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1032-gke - 5.15.0-1032.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-71-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-generic-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-ibm - 5.4.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1030.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1004-kvm - 5.4.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-71-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-71.78~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1005-oracle - 5.4.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-oracle - 5.15.0-1034.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
