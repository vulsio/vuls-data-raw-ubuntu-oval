		"Description": "A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions inafpd in Netatalk 3.1.x before 3.1.17. When parsing Spotlight RPC packets,one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keysare character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types inthe underlying protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of thedalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with akey, a malicious actor may be able to fully control the value of thepointer and theoretically achieve Remote Code Execution on the host. Thisissue is similar to CVE-2023-34967.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-42464` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnetatalk - 3.1.12~ds-4ubuntu0.20.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
