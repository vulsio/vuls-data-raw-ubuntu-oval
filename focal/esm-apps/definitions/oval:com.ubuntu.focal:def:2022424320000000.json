		"Title": "CVE-2022-42432 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux Kernel 6.0-rc2. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the nft_osf_eval function. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-18540.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42432` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-aws - 5.15.0-1027.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-bluefield - 5.4.0-1054.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gcp - 5.15.0-1026.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-gke - 5.4.0-1091.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-gkeop - 5.4.0-1061.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic-64k - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-kvm - 5.4.0-1083.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-oracle - 5.15.0-1027.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1078-raspi - 5.4.0-1078.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-aws - 5.15.0-1027.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-azure - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1100.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-bluefield - 5.4.0-1054.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-gcp - 5.15.0-1026.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-gke - 5.4.0-1091.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gke - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-gkeop - 5.4.0-1061.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-57-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-57-generic-64k - 5.15.0-57.63~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1023-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1023.28~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-kvm - 5.4.0-1083.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-58-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-58.64~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-oracle - 5.15.0-1027.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
