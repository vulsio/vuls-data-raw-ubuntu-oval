		"Title": "CVE-2019-19232 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** In Sudo through 1.8.29, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer account can impersonate a nonexistent user by invoking sudo with a numeric uid that is not associated with any user. NOTE: The software maintainer believes that this is not a vulnerability because running a command via sudo as a user not present in the local password database is an intentional feature. Because this behavior surprised some users, sudo 1.8.30 introduced an option to enable/disable this behavior with the default being disabled. However, this does not change the fact that sudo was behaving as intended, and as documented, in earlier versions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19232` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsudo - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1\nsudo-ldap - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
