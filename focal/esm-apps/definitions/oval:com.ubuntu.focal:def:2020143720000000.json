		"Description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06, where it incorrectlyenables the usage of the ACPI command when Secure Boot is enabled. Thisflaw allows an attacker with privileged access to craft a Secondary SystemDescription Table (SSDT) containing code to overwrite the Linux kernellockdown variable content directly into memory. The table is further loadedand executed by the kernel, defeating its Secure Boot lockdown and allowingthe attacker to load unsigned code. The highest threat from thisvulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity, as well as systemavailability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-14372` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu44.2\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.167.2+2.04-1ubuntu44.2\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.167.2+2.04-1ubuntu44.2\nNo subscription required",
