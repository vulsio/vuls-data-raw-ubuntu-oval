		"description": "A vulnerability was found in upstream release cryptsetup-2.2.0 where,there's a bug in LUKS2 format validation code, that is effectively invokedon every device/image presenting itself as LUKS2 container. The bug is insegments validation code in file 'lib/luks2/luks2_json_metadata.c' infunction hdr_validate_segments(struct crypt_device *cd, json_object*hdr_jobj) where the code does not check for possible overflow on memoryallocation used for intervals array (see statement \"intervals =malloc(first_backup * sizeof(*intervals));\"). Due to the bug, library canbe *tricked* to expect such allocation was successful but for far lessmemory then originally expected. Later it may read data FROM image craftedby an attacker and actually write such data BEYOND allocated memory.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-14382` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncryptsetup - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.2\ncryptsetup-bin - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.2\ncryptsetup-initramfs - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.2\ncryptsetup-run - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.2\nlibcryptsetup12 - 2:2.2.2-3ubuntu2.2\nNo subscription required",
