    "Title": "CVE-2023-2283 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in libssh, where the authentication check of the connecting client can be bypassed in the`pki_verify_data_signature` function in memory allocation problems. This issue may happen if there is insufficient memory or the memory usage is limited. The problem is caused by the return value `rc,` which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The value of the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification. Therefore any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2283` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssh-4 - 0.9.3-2ubuntu2.3\nlibssh-gcrypt-4 - 0.9.3-2ubuntu2.3\nNo subscription required",
