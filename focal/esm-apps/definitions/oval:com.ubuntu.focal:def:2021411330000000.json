		"Title": "CVE-2021-41133 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxeddesktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0,Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used byWayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OSservices into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary,non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating the VFSusing recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak'sdenylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info`or make that file disappear entirely. Flatpak apps that act as clients forAF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulsecan escalate the privileges that the corresponding services will believethe Flatpak app has. Note that protocols that operate entirely over theD-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are notaffected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process`xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, wheninteracting with these buses. Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0,and as of time of publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned.There are no workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41133` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nflatpak - 1.6.5-0ubuntu0.4\nflatpak-tests - 1.6.5-0ubuntu0.4\ngir1.2-flatpak-1.0 - 1.6.5-0ubuntu0.4\nlibflatpak0 - 1.6.5-0ubuntu0.4\nNo subscription required",
