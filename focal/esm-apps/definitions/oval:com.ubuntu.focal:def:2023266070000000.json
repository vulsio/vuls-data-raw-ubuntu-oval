    "Title": "CVE-2023-26607 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_attr_find in fs/ntfs/attrib.c. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-26607` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1104.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-bluefield - 5.4.0-1059.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-gke - 5.4.0-1095.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-gkeop - 5.4.0-1065.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-kvm - 5.4.0-1087.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1081-raspi - 5.4.0-1081.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1104.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-bluefield - 5.4.0-1059.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-gke - 5.4.0-1095.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-gkeop - 5.4.0-1065.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-kvm - 5.4.0-1087.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
