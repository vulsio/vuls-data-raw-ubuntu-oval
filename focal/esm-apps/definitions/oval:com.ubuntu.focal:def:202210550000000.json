		"Title": "CVE-2022-1055 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free exists in the Linux Kernel in tc_new_tfilter that could allow a local attacker to gain privilege escalation. The exploit requires unprivileged user namespaces. We recommend upgrading past commit 04c2a47ffb13c29778e2a14e414ad4cb5a5db4b5 It was discovered that the network traffic control implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1055` to fix the vulnerability.
