    "Title": "CVE-2022-28893 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "The SUNRPC subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.17.2 can call xs_xprt_free before ensuring that sockets are in the intended state. Felix Fu discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket states, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-28893` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-aws - 5.15.0-1017.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-azure - 5.15.0-1017.20~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1017.20~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-bluefield - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gcp - 5.15.0-1016.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-gke - 5.15.0-1014.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-43-generic - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-43-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-generic - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-generic-64k - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-kvm - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-lowlatency - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1044-oem - 5.14.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-oracle - 5.15.0-1016.20~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1068-raspi - 5.4.0-1068.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-aws - 5.15.0-1017.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1017-azure - 5.15.0-1017.20~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1017.20~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-bluefield - 5.4.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-gcp - 5.15.0-1016.21~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-gke - 5.15.0-1014.17~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-43-generic - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-43-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-generic - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-generic-64k - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1015-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1015.20~20.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-kvm - 5.4.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-lowlatency - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-43-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-43.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1044-oem - 5.14.0-1044.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1016-oracle - 5.15.0-1016.20~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
