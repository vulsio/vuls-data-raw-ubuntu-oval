    "Title": "CVE-2016-2854 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "The aufs module for the Linux kernel 3.x and 4.x does not properly maintain POSIX ACL xattr data, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging a group-writable setgid directory. It was discovered that the aufs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly maintain POSIX ACL xattr data, when mounted with the non-default allow_userns option. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.",
