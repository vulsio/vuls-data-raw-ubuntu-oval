    "Title": "CVE-2021-22890 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows a malicious HTTPS proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of TLS 1.3 session tickets. When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly \"short-cut\" the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-22890` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nlibcurl4 - 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.5\nNo subscription required",
