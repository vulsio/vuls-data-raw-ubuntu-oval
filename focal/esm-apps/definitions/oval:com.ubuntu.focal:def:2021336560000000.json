		"Title": "CVE-2021-33656 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "When setting font with malicous data by ioctl cmd PIO_FONT,kernel will write memory out of bounds. It was discovered that the virtual terminal driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle VGA console font changes, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33656` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-lowlatency - 5.4.0-125.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-aws - 5.4.0-1084.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-azure - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-bluefield - 5.4.0-1045.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-gcp - 5.4.0-1087.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-gke - 5.4.0-1081.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gkeop - 5.4.0-1052.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-ibm - 5.4.0-1032.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-kvm - 5.4.0-1074.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-oracle - 5.4.0-1082.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1069-raspi - 5.4.0-1069.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-5.4.0-125-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-generic - 5.4.0-125.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-125-lowlatency - 5.4.0-125.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-aws - 5.4.0-1084.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1014-aws - 5.15.0-1014.18~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-azure - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure-fde - 5.4.0-1090.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1007.8~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-bluefield - 5.4.0-1045.50\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-gcp - 5.4.0-1087.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1006-gcp - 5.15.0-1006.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-gke - 5.4.0-1081.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1011-gke - 5.15.0-1011.14~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gkeop - 5.4.0-1052.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-generic-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-ibm - 5.4.0-1032.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1003-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1003.5~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-kvm - 5.4.0-1074.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-33-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-33.34~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1004-oem - 5.14.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-oracle - 5.4.0-1082.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1007-oracle - 5.15.0-1007.9~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
