		"description": "A vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform's guest-oslogin versions between20190304 and 20200507 allows a user that is only granted the role\"roles/compute.osLogin\" to escalate privileges to root. Using theirmembership to the \"adm\" group, users with this role are able to read theDHCP XID from the systemd journal. Using the DHCP XID, it is then possibleto set the IP address and hostname of the instance to any value, which isthen stored in /etc/hosts. An attacker can then pointmetadata.google.internal to an arbitrary IP address and impersonate the GCEmetadata server which make it is possible to instruct the OS Login PAMmodule to grant administrative privileges. All images created after2020-May-07 (20200507) are fixed, and if you cannot update, we recommendyou edit /etc/group/security.conf and remove the \"adm\" user from the OSLogin entry.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-8903` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngce-compute-image-packages - 20190801-0ubuntu4.1\ngoogle-compute-engine-oslogin - 20190801-0ubuntu4.1\npython3-google-compute-engine - 20190801-0ubuntu4.1\nNo subscription required",
