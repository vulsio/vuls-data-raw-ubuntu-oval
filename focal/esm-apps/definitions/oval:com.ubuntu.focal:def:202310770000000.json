    "Title": "CVE-2023-1077 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry, not detected by the BUG_ON condition, as the confused entry will not be NULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a type confused entry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused sched_rt_entity,causing memory corruption. It was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1077` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-aws - 5.15.0-1038.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-azure - 5.15.0-1040.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1040.47~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-bluefield - 5.4.0-1065.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gcp - 5.15.0-1036.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-gke - 5.4.0-1102.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gke - 5.15.0-1036.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gkeop - 5.4.0-1071.75\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic-64k - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-kvm - 5.4.0-1093.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-oracle - 5.15.0-1037.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1088.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1038-aws - 5.15.0-1038.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-azure - 5.15.0-1040.47~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1040.47~20.04.1.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-bluefield - 5.4.0-1065.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gcp - 5.15.0-1036.44~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-gke - 5.4.0-1102.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1036-gke - 5.15.0-1036.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gkeop - 5.4.0-1071.75\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-75-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-generic-64k - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1033-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1033.38~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1017-iot - 5.4.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-kvm - 5.4.0-1093.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-75-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-75.82~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-oracle - 5.15.0-1037.43~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1024.28\nNo subscription required",
