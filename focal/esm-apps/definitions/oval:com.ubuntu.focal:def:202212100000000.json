In the issue page for this vulnerability (issue 402), there is a discussion about this actually being a libjbig bug instead of a tiff bug. this issue was marked as a duplicate of CVE-2017-9937 by upstream on 2023-02-22. CVE-2017-9937 was mistakenly assigned to LibTIFF when it actually affected jbigkit. Therefore, none of the below releases are affected by this in the LibTIFF package."
