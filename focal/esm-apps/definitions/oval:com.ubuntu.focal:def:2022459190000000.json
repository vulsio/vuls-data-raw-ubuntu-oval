		"Title": "CVE-2022-45919 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45919` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gkeop - 5.4.0-1076.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1040.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-kvm - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1093-raspi - 5.4.0-1093.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-5.4.0-162-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1044-aws - 5.15.0-1044.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1046-azure - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1046.53~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-bluefield - 5.4.0-1070.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1041-gcp - 5.15.0-1041.49~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gkeop - 5.4.0-1076.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1027-gkeop - 5.15.0-1027.32~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-83-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-generic-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1037-ibm - 5.15.0-1037.40~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1040-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1040.46~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-iot - 5.4.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-kvm - 5.4.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-83-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-83.92~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1042-oracle - 5.15.0-1042.48~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1029-xilinx-zynqmp - 5.4.0-1029.33\nNo subscription required",
