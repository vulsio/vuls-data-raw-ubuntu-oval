		"Title": "CVE-2022-39249 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end. Starting with version 19.7.0, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately, for example, by showing a warning for such messages. This attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker, and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39249` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nthunderbird - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
