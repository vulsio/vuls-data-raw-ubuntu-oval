    "Title": "CVE-2023-31436 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - high.",
    "Description": "qfq_change_class in net/sched/sch_qfq.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.13 allows an out-of-bounds write because lmax can exceed QFQ_MIN_LMAX. Gwangun Jung discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31436` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-150.167\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic -
