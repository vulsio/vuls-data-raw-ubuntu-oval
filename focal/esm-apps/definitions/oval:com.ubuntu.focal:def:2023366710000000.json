		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662 formacOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such thatall IP traffic to the VPN server's IP address is sent in plaintext outsidethe VPN tunnel even if this traffic is not generated by the VPN client.This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending plaintext trafficto the VPN server's IP address and thereby deanonymize the victim. NOTE:the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer moregenerally to \"ServerIP attack for only traffic to the real IP address ofthe VPN server\" rather than to only Clario.",
