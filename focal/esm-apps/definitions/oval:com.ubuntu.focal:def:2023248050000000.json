		"Description": "cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required to getthe cups printing service working on operating systems other than macos. Ifyou use the Backend Error Handler (beh) to create an accessible networkprinter, this security vulnerability can cause remote code execution.`beh.c` contains the line `retval = system(cmdline) >> 8;` which calls the`system` command with the operand `cmdline`. `cmdline` contains multipleuser controlled, unsanitized values. As a result an attacker with networkaccess to the hosted print server can exploit this vulnerability to injectsystem commands which are executed in the context of the running server.This issue has been addressed in commit `8f2740357` and is expected to bebundled in the next release. Users are advised to upgrade when possible andto restrict access to network printers in the meantime.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-24805` to fix the vulnerability.
