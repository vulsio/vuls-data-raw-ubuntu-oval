		"Title": "CVE-2023-25824 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "Mod_gnutls is a TLS module for Apache HTTPD based on GnuTLS. Versions from0.9.0 to 0.12.0 (including) did not properly fail blocking read operationson TLS connections when the transport hit timeouts. Instead it entered anendless loop retrying the read operation, consuming CPU resources. Thiscould be exploited for denial of service attacks. If trace level loggingwas enabled, it would also produce an excessive amount of log output duringthe loop, consuming disk space. The problem has been fixed in commitd7eec4e598158ab6a98bf505354e84352f9715ec, please update to version 0.12.1.There are no workarounds, users who cannot update should apply the errnofix detailed in the security advisory.",
