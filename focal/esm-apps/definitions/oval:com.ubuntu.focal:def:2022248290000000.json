		"description": "Garden is an automation platform for Kubernetes development and testing. Inversions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not requireauthentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gainaccess to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked throughthe /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving theGarden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 whichmakes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on theinternet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the abilityto compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users areadvised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable toupgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from alluntrusted network machines.",
