    "Title": "CVE-2022-47518 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of the number of channels in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow when copying the list of operating channels from Wi-Fi management frames. It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the number of channels, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-47518` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1031-aws - 5.15.0-1031.35~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1034-azure - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1051-azure-fde - 5.15.0-1034.41~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-gcp - 5.15.0-1030.37~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1028-gke - 5.15.0-1028.33~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-5.15.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-generic-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1026-intel-iotg - 5.15.0-1026.31~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-67-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-67.74~20.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.15.0-1030-oracle - 5.15.0-1030.36~20.04.1\nNo subscription required",
