		"description": "** DISPUTED ** In Sudo through 1.8.29, the fact that a user has beenblocked (e.g., by using the ! character in the shadow file instead of apassword hash) is not considered, allowing an attacker (who has access to aRunas ALL sudoer account) to impersonate any blocked user. NOTE: Thesoftware maintainer believes that this CVE is not valid. Disabling localpassword authentication for a user is not the same as disabling all accessto that user--the user may still be able to login via other means (ssh key,kerberos, etc). Both the Linux shadow(5) and passwd(1) manuals are clear onthis. Indeed it is a valid use case to have local accounts that are _only_accessible via sudo and that cannot be logged into with a password. Sudo1.8.30 added an optional setting to check the _shell_ of the target user(not the encrypted password!) against the contents of /etc/shells but thatis not the same thing as preventing access to users with an invalidpassword hash.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19234` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsudo - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1\nsudo-ldap - 1.8.31-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
