		"Title": "CVE-2022-30594 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium.",
		"Description": "The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag. Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce seccomp restrictions in some situations. A local attacker could use this to bypass intended seccomp sandbox restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-30594` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-113.127\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-generic -
