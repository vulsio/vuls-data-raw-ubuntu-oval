		"Title": "CVE-2020-28473 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "The package bottle from 0 and before 0.12.19 are vulnerable to Web CachePoisoning by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attackercan separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause adifference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (runningwith default configuration) and the server. This can result in maliciousrequests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usuallynot see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it ina cache key of an unkeyed parameter.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-28473` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-bottle - 0.12.15-2.1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
