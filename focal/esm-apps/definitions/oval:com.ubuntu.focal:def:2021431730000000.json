		"Title": "CVE-2021-43173 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - medium",
		"Description": "In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayedsignificantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowlydrip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used toeffectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-outvalue for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individualread or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDPrepository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it cancontinuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Sincevalidation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository hasconcluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinatorcontinuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation rundirectly after starting, never serve any data at all.",
