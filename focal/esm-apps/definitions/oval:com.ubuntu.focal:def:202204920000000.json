		"Title": "CVE-2022-0492 on Ubuntu 20.04 ESM (focal) - high.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s cgroup_release_agent_write in the kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly. Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang discovered that the cgroups implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1 release_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0492` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic -
