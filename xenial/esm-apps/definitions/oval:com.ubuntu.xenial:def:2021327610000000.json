    "Title": "CVE-2021-32761 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32761` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nredis-sentinel - 2:3.0.6-1ubuntu0.4+esm1\nredis-server - 2:3.0.6-1ubuntu0.4+esm1\nredis-tools - 2:3.0.6-1ubuntu0.4+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
