		"Title": "CVE-2023-5717 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If perf_read_group() is called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer. We recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06. Budimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-5717` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1163.176~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-oracle - 4.15.0-1126.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1163.176~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-oracle - 4.15.0-1126.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
