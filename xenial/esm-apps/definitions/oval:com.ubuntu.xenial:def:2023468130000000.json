		"Title": "CVE-2023-46813 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable bylocal users with userspace access to MMIO registers. Incorrect accesschecking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the SEV-ESemulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access to kernelmemory (and thus privilege escalation). This depends on a race conditionthrough which userspace can replace an instruction before the #VC handlerreads it.",
