		"Title": "CVE-2021-3864 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled whencertain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUIDbinary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal toeffective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. Asa result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to arelative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory withuid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUIDbinary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories,potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.",
