		"Title": "CVE-2022-31615 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where a local user with basic capabilities can cause a null-pointer dereference, which may lead to denial of service. Tal Lossos discovered that the NVIDIA graphics drivers incorrectly handled certain memory operations, leading to a null-pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
