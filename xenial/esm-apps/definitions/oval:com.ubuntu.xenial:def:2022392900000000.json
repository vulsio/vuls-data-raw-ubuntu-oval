In affected versions authenticated users can bypass CSRF keysby modifying the request supplied to the Zoneminder web application.

An attacker can take advantage of this by usingan HTTP GET request to perform actions with no CSRF protection. This couldallow an attacker to cause an authenticated user to perform unexpectedactions on the web application. Users are advised to upgrade as soon aspossible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
