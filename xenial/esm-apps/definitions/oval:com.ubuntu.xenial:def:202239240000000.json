		"Title": "CVE-2022-3924 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "This issue can affect BIND 9 resolvers with `stale-answer-enable yes;` thatalso make use of the option `stale-answer-client-timeout`, configured witha value greater than zero. If the resolver receives many queries thatrequire recursion, there will be a corresponding increase in the number ofclients that are waiting for recursion to complete. If there are sufficientclients already waiting when a new client query is received so that it isnecessary to SERVFAIL the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM`recursive-clients` limit and soft quota), then it is possible for a raceto occur between providing a stale answer to this older client and sendingan early timeout SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion failure. This issueaffects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10,9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",
