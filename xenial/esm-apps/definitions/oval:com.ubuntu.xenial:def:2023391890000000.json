		"Title": "CVE-2023-39189 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The nfnl_osf_add_callback function did not validate the user mode controlled opt_num field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure. Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39189` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1163.176~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-oracle - 4.15.0-1126.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1163.176~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-oracle - 4.15.0-1126.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
