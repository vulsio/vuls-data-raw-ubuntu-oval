    "Title": "CVE-2021-3517 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3517` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibxml2 - 2.9.3+dfsg1-1ubuntu0.7+esm1\nlibxml2-utils - 2.9.3+dfsg1-1ubuntu0.7+esm1\npython-libxml2 - 2.9.3+dfsg1-1ubuntu0.7+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
