		"Title": "CVE-2018-13405 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through3.16 allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership,in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writableby a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the non-member cantrigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. Theintended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of adirectory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. Thenon-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable andSGID.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-13405` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-134.160\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-134.160\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-134.160\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1095-raspi2 - 4.4.0-1095.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1099-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1099.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1066.76\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1032.38\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
