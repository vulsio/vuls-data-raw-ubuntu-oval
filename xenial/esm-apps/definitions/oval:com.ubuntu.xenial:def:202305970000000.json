    "Title": "CVE-2023-0597 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw possibility of memory leak in the Linux kernel cpu_entry_area mapping of X86 CPU data to memory was found in the way user can guess location of exception stack(s) or other important data. A local user could use this flaw to get access to some important data with expected location in memory. Seth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform address randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0597` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1162.175~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-gcp - 4.15.0-1156.173~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-lowlatency - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1125-oracle - 4.15.0-1125.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1162.175~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-gcp - 4.15.0-1156.173~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-lowlatency - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1125-oracle - 4.15.0-1125.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
