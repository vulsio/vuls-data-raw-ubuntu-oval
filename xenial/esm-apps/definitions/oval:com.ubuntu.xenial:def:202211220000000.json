    "Title": "CVE-2022-1122 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the opj2_decompress program in openjpeg2 2.4.0 in the way it handles an input directory with a large number of files. When it fails to allocate a buffer to store the filenames of the input directory, it calls free() on an uninitialized pointer, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial of service.",

The code does contain memory leak problems, but since nothing is freed, the vulnerability in this case does not exist."
