		"Title": "CVE-2019-12749 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as used in DBusServer in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less common, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of symlink mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the libdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-12749` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndbus - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\ndbus-tests - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\ndbus-user-session - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\ndbus-x11 - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\nlibdbus-1-3 - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
