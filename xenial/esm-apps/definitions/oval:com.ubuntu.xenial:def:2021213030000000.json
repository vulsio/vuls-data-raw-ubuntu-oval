		"Title": "CVE-2021-21303 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Helm is open-source software which is essentially \"The Kubernetes PackageManager\". Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages ofpre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version 3.0 and beforeversion 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from potentiallyuntrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a SemVer in the`version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases Helm allows the stringto be used \"as is\" without sanitizing. Helm fails to properly sanitizedsome fields present on Helm repository `index.yaml` files. Helm does notproperly sanitized some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins Insome cases, Helm does not properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml`file. By exploiting these attack vectors, core maintainers were able tosend deceptive information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command,as well as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, wecould send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, likeclearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helmmaintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly sanitizedwhen read out of repository index files. This fix remedies all such cases,and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version fields. All users ofthe Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version 3.5.2 or later. Those whouse Helm as a library should verify that they either sanitize this data ontheir own, or use the proper Helm API calls to sanitize the data.",
