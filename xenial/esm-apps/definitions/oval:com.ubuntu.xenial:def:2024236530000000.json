		"description": "BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in anefficient, expressive and repeatable manner. In addition to runningcontainers as build steps, BuildKit also provides APIs for runninginteractive containers based on built images. It was possible to use theseAPIs to ask BuildKit to run a container with elevated privileges. Normally,running such containers is only allowed if special `security.insecure`entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed by theuser initializing the build request. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5 .Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.",
