    "Title": "CVE-2022-1011 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write(). This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in privilege escalation. Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1011` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
