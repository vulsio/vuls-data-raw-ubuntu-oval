		"Title": "CVE-2017-7692 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "SquirrelMail 1.4.22 (and other versions before 20170427_0200-SVN) allowspost-authentication remote code execution via a sendmail.cf file that ismishandled in a popen call. It's possible to exploit this vulnerability toexecute arbitrary shell commands on the remote server. The problem is inthe Deliver_SendMail.class.php with the initStream function that usesescapeshellcmd() to sanitize the sendmail command before executing it. Theuse of escapeshellcmd() is not correct in this case since it doesn't escapewhitespaces, allowing the injection of arbitrary command parameters. Theproblem is in -f$envelopefrom within the sendmail command line. Hence, ifthe target server uses sendmail and SquirrelMail is configured to use it asa command-line program, it's possible to trick sendmail into using anattacker-provided configuration file that triggers the execution of anarbitrary command. For exploitation, the attacker must upload a sendmail.cffile as an email attachment, and inject the sendmail.cf filename with the-C option within the \"Options > Personal Informations > Email Address\"setting.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-7692` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquirrelmail - 2:1.4.23~svn20120406-2+deb8u1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
