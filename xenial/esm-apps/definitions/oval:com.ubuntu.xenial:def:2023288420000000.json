		"Title": "CVE-2023-28842 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Moby) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. thatis distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various otherdownstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), whichis developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*. Swarm Mode,which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thuspresent in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in containerorchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit andsupporting network code. The `overlay` network driver is a core feature ofSwarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communicationbetween containers and services across the cluster. This driver is animplementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet)frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata,including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlaynetwork. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional,off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLANpackets traverses an untrusted network between nodes. Encrypted overlaynetworks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use ofthe IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. Bydeploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain theadditional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof,data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality throughencryption. When setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network,Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforceboth incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptablesextension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on aVXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced onencrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networksor other users of VXLAN. The `overlay` driver dynamically and lazilydefines the kernel configuration for the VXLAN network on each node ascontainers are attached and detached. Routes and encryption parameters areonly defined for destination nodes that participate in the network. Theiptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from acceptingunencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available with which tocommunicate. Encrypted overlay networks silently accept cleartext VXLANdatagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. Asa result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into theencrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams. Theimplications of this can be quite dire, and GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw should bereferenced for a deeper exploration. Patches are available in Moby releases23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases arenumbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.Some workarounds are available. In multi-node clusters, deploy a global‘pause’ container for each encrypted overlay network, on every node. For asingle-node cluster, do not use overlay networks of any sort. Bridgenetworks provide the same connectivity on a single node and have nomulti-node features. The Swarm ingress feature is implemented using anoverlay network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` modeinstead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load balancer),and removing the `ingress` network. If encrypted overlay networks are inexclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that has not been validatedby IPSec.",
