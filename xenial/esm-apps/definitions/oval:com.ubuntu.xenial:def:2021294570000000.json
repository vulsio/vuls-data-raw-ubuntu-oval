		"Title": "CVE-2021-29457 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29457` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nexiv2 - 0.25-2.1ubuntu16.04.7+esm1\nlibexiv2-14 - 0.25-2.1ubuntu16.04.7+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
