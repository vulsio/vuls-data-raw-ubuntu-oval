    "Title": "CVE-2020-27171 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly compute a speculative execution limit on pointer arithmetic in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-27171` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-aws - 4.15.0-1097.104~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-azure - 4.15.0-1111.123~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-gcp - 4.15.0-1096.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1068-oracle - 4.15.0-1068.76~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-aws - 4.15.0-1097.104~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-azure - 4.15.0-1111.123~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-gcp - 4.15.0-1096.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1068-oracle - 4.15.0-1068.76~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
