		"Title": "CVE-2021-3527 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. SmallUSB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reducethe overhead and improve performance. The combined size of the bulktransfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) onthe stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, amalicious guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and causethe QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack, resultingin a denial of service.",
