		"Title": "CVE-2020-25601 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a lack ofpreemption in evtchn_reset() / evtchn_destroy(). In particular, the FIFOevent channel model allows guests to have a large number of event channelsactive at a time. Closing all of these (when resetting all event channelsor when cleaning up after the guest) may take extended periods of time. Sofar, there was no arrangement for preemption at suitable intervals,allowing a CPU to spend an almost unbounded amount of time in theprocessing of these operations. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mounta Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system. All Xenversions are vulnerable in principle. Whether versions 4.3 and older arevulnerable depends on underlying hardware characteristics.",
