		"Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using`ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender`return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder withcalldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does notappear to be common, in particular it is not the case for`MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarderthe team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to allcalls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched inv4.9.3.",
