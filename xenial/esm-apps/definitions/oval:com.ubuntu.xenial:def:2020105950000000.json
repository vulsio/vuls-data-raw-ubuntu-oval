		"Title": "CVE-2020-10595 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "pam-krb5 before 4.9 has a buffer overflow that might cause remote codeexecution in situations involving supplemental prompting by a Kerberoslibrary. It may overflow a buffer provided by the underlying Kerberoslibrary by a single '\\0' byte if an attacker responds to a prompt with ananswer of a carefully chosen length. The effect may range from heapcorruption to stack corruption depending on the structure of the underlyingKerberos library, with unknown effects but possibly including codeexecution. This code path is not used for normal authentication, but onlywhen the Kerberos library does supplemental prompting, such as with PKINITor when using the non-standard no_prompt PAM configuration option.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10595` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibpam-heimdal - 4.7-2ubuntu0.1\nlibpam-krb5 - 4.7-2ubuntu0.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
