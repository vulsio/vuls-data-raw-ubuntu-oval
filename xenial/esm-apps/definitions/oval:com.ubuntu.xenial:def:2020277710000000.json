		"Title": "CVE-2020-27771 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low",
		"Description": "In RestoreMSCWarning() of /coders/pdf.c there are several areas where callsto GetPixelIndex() could result in values outside the range ofrepresentable for the unsigned char type. The patch casts the return valueof GetPixelIndex() to ssize_t type to avoid this bug. This undefinedbehavior could be triggered when ImageMagick processes a crafted pdf file.Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity because although itcould potentially lead to an impact to application availability, nospecific impact was demonstrated in this case. This flaw affectsImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.",
