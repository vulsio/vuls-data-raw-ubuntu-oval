    "Title": "CVE-2017-18196 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "Leptonica 1.74.4 constructs unintended pathnames (containing duplicated path components) when operating on files in /tmp subdirectories, which might allow local users to bypass intended file restrictions by leveraging access to a directory located deeper within the /tmp directory tree, as demonstrated by /tmp/ANY/PATH/ANY/PATH/input.tif. It was discovered that Leptonica incorrectly handled path names. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-18196` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nleptonica-progs - 1.73-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nliblept5 - 1.73-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
