No patches addressing CVE-2020-35521 specifically were found, and the upstream changelog indicates that commit b5a935d96b is fixing more than one issue, both being most likely closely related. No reproducers or stack traces involving this vulnerability were found, and the issue links (207 and 209) seem to not exist anymore. Therefore, releases that have been patched for CVE-2020-35522 will be considered to have been patched for CVE-2020-35521 as well, as the only sources of information indicate that the patch for both issues is the same."
