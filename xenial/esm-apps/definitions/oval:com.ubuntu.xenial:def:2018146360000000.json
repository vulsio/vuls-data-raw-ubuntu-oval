		"description": "Live-migrated instances are briefly able to inspect traffic for otherinstances on the same hypervisor. This brief window could be extendedindefinitely if the instance's port is set administratively down prior tolive-migration and kept down after the migration is complete. This ispossible due to the Open vSwitch integration bridge being connected to theinstance during migration. When connected to the integration bridge, alltraffic for instances using the same Open vSwitch instance wouldpotentially be visible to the migrated guest, as the required Open vSwitchVLAN filters are only applied post-migration. Versions of openstack-neutronbefore 13.0.0.0b2, 12.0.3, 11.0.5 are vulnerable.",
