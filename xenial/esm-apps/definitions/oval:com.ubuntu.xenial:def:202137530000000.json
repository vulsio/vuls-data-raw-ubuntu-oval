		"Title": "CVE-2021-3753 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access to vc_mode is not protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. It was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3753` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-lowlatency - 4.4.0-242.276\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1158-aws - 4.4.0-1158.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-aws - 4.15.0-1115.122~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-gcp - 4.15.0-1111.125~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-lowlatency - 4.15.0-162.170~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1121-kvm - 4.4.0-1121.131\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-oracle - 4.15.0-1083.91~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-lowlatency - 4.4.0-242.276\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-aws - 4.15.0-1115.122~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-gcp - 4.15.0-1111.125~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-lowlatency - 4.15.0-162.170~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-oracle - 4.15.0-1083.91~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
