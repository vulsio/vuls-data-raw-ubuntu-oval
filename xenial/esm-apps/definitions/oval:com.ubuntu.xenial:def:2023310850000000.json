		"Title": "CVE-2023-31085 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/mtd/ubi/cdev.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a divide-by-zero error in do_div(sz,mtd->erasesize), used indirectly by ctrl_cdev_ioctl, when mtd->erasesize is 0. Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31085` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1163.176~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-oracle - 4.15.0-1126.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-aws - 4.15.0-1163.176~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-142-lowlatency - 4.15.0-220.231~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-oracle - 4.15.0-1126.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
