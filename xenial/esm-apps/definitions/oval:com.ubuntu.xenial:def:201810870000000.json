		"Title": "CVE-2018-1087 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - high",
		"Description": "kernel KVM before versions kernel 4.16, kernel 4.16-rc7, kernel 4.17-rc1,kernel 4.17-rc2 and kernel 4.17-rc3 is vulnerable to a flaw in the way theLinux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled exceptions delivered after a stackswitch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the stack switchoperation, the processor did not deliver interrupts and exceptions, ratherthey are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch isexecuted. An unprivileged KVM guest user could use this flaw to crash theguest or, potentially, escalate their privileges in the guest.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1087` to fix the vulnerability.
