		"Title": "CVE-2021-23985 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "If an attacker is able to alter specific about:config values (for example malware running on the user's computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could have been enabled in a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed a remote attacker (able to make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor the user's browsing activity and (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed by providing a visual cue when Devtools has an open network socket. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-23985` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 87.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.2\nfirefox-geckodriver - 87.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.2\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 87.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
