		"Title": "CVE-2021-29647 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure, aka CID-50535249f624. It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29647` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-aws - 4.15.0-1103.110~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1100-gcp - 4.15.0-1100.113~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-lowlatency - 4.15.0-144.148~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1072-oracle - 4.15.0-1072.80~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-aws - 4.15.0-1103.110~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1100-gcp - 4.15.0-1100.113~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-lowlatency - 4.15.0-144.148~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1072-oracle - 4.15.0-1072.80~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
