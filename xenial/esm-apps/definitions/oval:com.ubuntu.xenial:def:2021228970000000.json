		"Description": "curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrongsession due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST whenlibcurl is built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected cipher setwas stored in a single \"static\" variable in the library, which has thesurprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrenttransfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control theset used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transportsecurity significantly.",
