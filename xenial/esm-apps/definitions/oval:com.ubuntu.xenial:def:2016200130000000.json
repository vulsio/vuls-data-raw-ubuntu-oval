We may mark all of these packages as 'ignored' without any further work. rodrigo-zaiden> Despite the risks of applying any changes, there are no clues that glibc upstream will get this fixed. But just to make sure, before marking as ignored, I will mark as deferred as of 2022-06-01 so we can revisit it in the future."
