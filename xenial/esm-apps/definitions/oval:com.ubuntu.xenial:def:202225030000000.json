		"Description": "Dm-verity is used for extending root-of-trust to root filesystems. LoadPinbuilds on this property to restrict module/firmware loads to just thetrusted root filesystem. Device-mapper table reloads currently allow userswith root privileges to switch out the target with an equivalent dm-lineartarget and bypass verification till reboot. This allows root to bypassLoadPin and can be used to load untrusted and unverified kernel modules andfirmware, which implies arbitrary kernel execution and persistence forperipherals that do not verify firmware updates. We recommend upgradingpast commit 4caae58406f8ceb741603eee460d79bacca9b1b5",
