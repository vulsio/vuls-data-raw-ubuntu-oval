		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module before1.0.0 which allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame. Theping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previouslygiven payload of the ping frame. This is exactly what you expect, butinternally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Bufferinstance and that is where the vulnerability existed. ws didn't do anychecks for the type of data it was sending. With buffers in node when youallocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amountof bytes.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-10518` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-ws - 1.0.1+ds1.e6ddaae4-1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
