		"Title": "CVE-2023-30585 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version)installation process, specifically affecting Windows users who installNode.js using the .msi installer. This vulnerability emerges during therepair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NTAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environmentvariable from the current user's registry. The issue arises when the pathreferenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. Insuch cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified pathin an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitraryfolders in arbitrary locations. The severity of this vulnerability isheightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in theWindows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users.Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans,can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged\"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation offolders in unintended and potentially malicious locations. It is importantto note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who installNode.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other installationmethods are not affected by this particular issue.",
