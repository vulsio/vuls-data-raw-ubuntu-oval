		"description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux accordingto the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linuxprocess capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enablingprograms with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilitiesto the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect thecontainer security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained morecapabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bughas been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behaviorsuch that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed(as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritablecapabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set anyinheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`)file.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29162` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrunc - 1.0.0~rc7+git20190403.029124da-0ubuntu1~16.04.4+esm4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
