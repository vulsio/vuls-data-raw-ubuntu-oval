		"Title": "CVE-2021-32803 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15,and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability viainsufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any filewhose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. Thisis, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are notsymlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls todetermine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached whendirectories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tarfiles that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name asthe directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory beingcreated and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory ispresent in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for thatdirectory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks forsymlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing thatdirectory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlinkchecks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file tosymlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitraryfiles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation andoverwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and6.1.2.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32803` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-tar - 6.1.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
