    "Title": "CVE-2021-28688 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11. It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28688` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1138-aws - 4.4.0-1138.152\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1103-kvm - 4.4.0-1103.112\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
