		"Title": "CVE-2018-12891 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. Certain PV MMU operationsmay take a long time to process. For that reason Xen explicitly checks forthe need to preempt the current vCPU at certain points. A few rarely takencode paths did bypass such checks. By suitably enforcing the conditionsthrough its own page table contents, a malicious guest may cause suchbypasses to be used for an unbounded number of iterations. A malicious orbuggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entirehost. Specifically, it may prevent use of a physical CPU for anindeterminate period of time. All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards arevulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to an even widerclass of attacks, due to them lacking preemption checks altogether in theaffected code paths. Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are notaffected. Only multi-vCPU x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86HVM or PVH guests as well as x86 single-vCPU PV ones cannot leverage thevulnerability.",
