		"Title": "CVE-2023-22797 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An open redirect vulnerability is fixed in Rails 7.0.4.1 with the new protection against open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer was fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check introduced could allow an attacker to bypass with a carefully crafted URL resulting in an open redirect vulnerability.",
