    "Title": "CVE-2022-3635 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - negligible.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function tst_timer of the file drivers/atm/idt77252.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211934 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the IDT 77252 ATM PCI device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly remove any pending timers during device exit, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3635` to fix the vulnerability.
