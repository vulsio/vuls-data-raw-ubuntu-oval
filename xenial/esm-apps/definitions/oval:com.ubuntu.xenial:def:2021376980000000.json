Icinga 2instances which connect to any of the mentioned time series databases(TSDBs) using TLS over a spoofable infrastructure should immediatelyupgrade to version 2.13.1, 2.12.6, or 2.11.11 to patch the issue. Suchinstances should also change the credentials (if any) used by the TSDBwriter feature to authenticate against the TSDB. There are no workaroundsaside from upgrading.",
