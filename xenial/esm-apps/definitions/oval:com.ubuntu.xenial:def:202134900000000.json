		"Title": "CVE-2021-3490 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in the Linux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turned into out of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 049c4e13714e (\"bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations\") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by commit 3f50f132d840 (\"bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking\") (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variant was introduced by 2921c90d4718 (\"bpf:Fix a verifier failure with xor\") ( 5.10-rc1). Manfred Paul discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly track bounds on bitwise operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
