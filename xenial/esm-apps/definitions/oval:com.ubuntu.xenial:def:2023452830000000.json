		"Title": "CVE-2023-45283 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \\??\\ prefix asspecial. On Windows, a path beginning with \\??\\ is a Root Local Device pathequivalent to a path beginning with \\\\?\\. Paths with a \\??\\ prefix may beused to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path\\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x. Before fix, Cleancould convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local devicepath \\??\\b. Clean will now convert this to .\\??\\b. Similarly, Join(\\, ??,b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into theroot local device path \\??\\b. Join will now convert this to \\.\\??\\b. Inaddition, with fix, IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \\??\\as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \\??\\ prefix as a volumename.",
