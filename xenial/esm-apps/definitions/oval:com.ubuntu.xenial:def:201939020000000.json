    "Description": "A flaw was found in Mercurial before 4.9. It was possible to use symlinks and subrepositories to defeat Mercurial's path-checking logic and write files outside a repository. It was discovered that Mercurial mishandled symlinks in subrepositories. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write arbitrary files to the target's filesystem.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3902` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmercurial - 3.7.3-1ubuntu1.2+esm2\nmercurial-common - 3.7.3-1ubuntu1.2+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
