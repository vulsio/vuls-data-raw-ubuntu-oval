These scripts are executed in avictim’s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field.In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is ahighly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract theSession ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due toother vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a lowprivileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilegeescalation.",
