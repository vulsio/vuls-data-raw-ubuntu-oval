		"Title": "CVE-2023-27535 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the FTPconnection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being usedduring subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in aconnection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certainFTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in theconfiguration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This couldlead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
