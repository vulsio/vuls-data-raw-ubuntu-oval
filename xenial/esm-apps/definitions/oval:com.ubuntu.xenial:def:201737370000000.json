		"Title": "CVE-2017-3737 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an \"error state\"mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshakethen OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail ifyou attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for theexplicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() andSSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly ifSSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if thehandshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial functioncall. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the applicationfor the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed withoutbeing decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In orderto exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present thatresulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after havingalready received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected.Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-3737` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
