    "Title": "CVE-2023-40743 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an application, it may not have been obvious that looking up a service through \"ServiceFactory.getService\" allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE. As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to \"ServiceFactory.getService\", or by applying the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210 . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-40743` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibaxis-java - 1.4-24ubuntu0.1~esm1\nNo subscription required",
