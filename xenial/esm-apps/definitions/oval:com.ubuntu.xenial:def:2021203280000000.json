		"description": "Specific versions of the Java driver that support client-side field levelencryption (CSFLE) fail to perform correct host name verification on theKMS server’s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with aprivileged network position active MITM attack could result in interceptionof traffic between the Java driver and the KMS service rendering FieldLevel Encryption ineffective. This issue was discovered during internaltesting and affects all versions of the Java driver that support CSFLE. TheJava async, Scala, and reactive streams drivers are not impacted. Thisvulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supportedkey services originating from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP,and Azure network fabrics due to compensating controls in theseenvironments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don’t useField Level Encryption.",
