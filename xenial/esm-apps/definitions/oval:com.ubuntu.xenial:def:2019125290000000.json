		"Title": "CVE-2019-12529 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x through 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x through3.5.28, and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use BasicAuthentication, the Proxy-Authorization header is parsed via uudecode.uudecode determines how many bytes will be decoded by iterating over theinput and checking its table. The length is then used to start decoding thestring. There are no checks to ensure that the length it calculates isn'tgreater than the input buffer. This leads to adjacent memory being decodedas well. An attacker would not be able to retrieve the decoded data unlessthe Squid maintainer had configured the display of usernames on errorpages.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-12529` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid-cgi - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid-common - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid-purge - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid3 - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquidclient - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nNo subscription required",
