		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. The filterparsing in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c could be called with nofilter, which is an N=0 case when it expected at least one line to havebeen read, thus making the N-1 index invalid. This allows attackers tocause a denial of service (slab out-of-bounds write) or possibly haveunspecified other impact via crafted perf_event_open and mmap system calls.",
