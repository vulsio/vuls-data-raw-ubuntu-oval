		"Title": "CVE-2018-1000005 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in codehandling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported(https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailercould mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less thanrequired. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headersfrom the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the targetbuffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added afterthe colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. Whenaccessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or thatthe (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to adenial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has aservice that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1000005` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nNo subscription required",
