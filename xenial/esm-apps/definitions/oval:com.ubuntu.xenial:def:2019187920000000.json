		"Title": "CVE-2019-18792 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It is possible to bypass/evadeany tcp based signature by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FINpacket. The fake FIN packet is injected just before the PUSH ACK packet wewant to bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) will be ignoredby Suricata because it overlaps the FIN packet (the sequence and ack numberare identical in the two packets). The client will ignore the fake FINpacket because the ACK flag is not set. Both linux and windows clients areignoring the injected packet.",
