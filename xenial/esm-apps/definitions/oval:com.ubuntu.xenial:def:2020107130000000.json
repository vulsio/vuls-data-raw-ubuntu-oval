		"Title": "CVE-2020-10713 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - high",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use theGRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flawalso allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load anuntrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need to establishaccess to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain the ability toalter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a networked system withroot access. With this access, an attacker could then craft a string tocause a buffer overflow by injecting a malicious payload that leads toarbitrary code execution within GRUB. The highest threat from thisvulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as systemavailability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10713` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-common - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-coreboot - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-coreboot-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-arm - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-arm-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-ia32 - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-ia32-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-emu - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-firmware-qemu - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-ieee1275 - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-ieee1275-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-linuxbios - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-pc - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-pc-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-rescue-pc - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-theme-starfield - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-uboot - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-uboot-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-xen - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-xen-bin - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-xen-host - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub2 - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub2-common - 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.66.26+2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.66.26+2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26\nNo subscription required",
