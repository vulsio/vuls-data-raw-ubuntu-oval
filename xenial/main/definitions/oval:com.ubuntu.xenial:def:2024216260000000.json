		"description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux accordingto the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internalfile descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned containerprocess (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystemnamespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the hostfilesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious imageto allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem throughrunc run (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used tooverwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete containerescapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches forthis issue.",
