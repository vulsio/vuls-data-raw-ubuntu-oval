		"Description": "The ksmbd server through 3.4.2, as used in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8,sometimes communicates in cleartext even though encryption has beenenabled. This occurs because it sets the SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION flagwhen using the SMB 3.1.1 protocol, which is a violation of the SMB protocolspecification. When Windows 10 detects this protocol violation, it disablesencryption.",
