If that fileendsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline,curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if thereadworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most casescause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause differentoutcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to anapplication or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used asdenial-of-service.",
