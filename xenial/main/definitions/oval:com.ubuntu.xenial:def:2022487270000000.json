		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: arm64: Avoid consuming a stale esr value when SError occurWhen any exception other than an IRQ occurs, the CPU updates the ESR_EL2register with the exception syndrome. An SError may also become pending,and will be synchronised by KVM. KVM notes the exception type, and whetheran SError was synchronised in exit_code.When an exception other than an IRQ occurs, fixup_guest_exit() updatesvcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2 from the hardware register. When an SError wassynchronised, the vcpu esr value is used to determine if the exceptionwas due to an HVC. If so, ELR_EL2 is moved back one instruction. Thisis so that KVM can process the SError first, and re-execute the HVC ifthe guest survives the SError.But if an IRQ synchronises an SError, the vcpu's esr value is stale.If the previous non-IRQ exception was an HVC, KVM will corrupt ELR_EL2,causing an unrelated guest instruction to be executed twice.Check ARM_EXCEPTION_CODE() before messing with ELR_EL2, IRQs don'tupdate this register so don't need to check.",
