		"Description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support formulti-language development. This is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits)for PGP keys. Users of dependency verification in Gradle are vulnerable ifthey use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in theirdependency verification metadata file. The fix is to fail dependencyverification if anything but a fingerprint is used in a trust element independency verification metadata. The problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 andabove. The problem is also patched in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1. As aworkaround, use only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp`element in the metadata is a protection against this issue.",
