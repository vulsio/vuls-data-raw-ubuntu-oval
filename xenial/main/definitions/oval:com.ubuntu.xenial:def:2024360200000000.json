		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i40e:fix vf may be used uninitialized in this function warning To fix theregression introduced by commit 52424f974bc5, which causes servers hang invery hard to reproduce conditions with resets races. Using two sources forthe information is the root cause. In this function before the fix bumpingv didn't mean bumping vf pointer. But the code used this variablesinterchangeably, so stale vf could point to different/not intended vf.Remove redundant \"v\" variable and iterate via single VF pointer acrosswhole function instead to guarantee VF pointer validity.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36020` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
