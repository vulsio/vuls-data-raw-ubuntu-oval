		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/msm/dpu: move dpu_encoder's connector assignment to atomic_enable()For cases where the crtc's connectors_changed was set without enable/activegetting toggled , there is an atomic_enable() call followed by anatomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set().This results in a NULL ptr access for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call inthe atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoder's connector was cleared in theatomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set()call.Fix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() andalsouse drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder() to get the connector fromthe atomic_state.Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/606729/",
