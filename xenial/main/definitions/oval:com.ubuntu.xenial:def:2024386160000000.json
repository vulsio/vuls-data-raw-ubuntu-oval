		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: carl9170: re-fix fortified-memset warningThe carl9170_tx_release() function sometimes triggers a fortified-memsetwarning in my randconfig builds:In file included from include/linux/string.h:254,                 from drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:40:In function 'fortify_memset_chk',    inlined from 'carl9170_tx_release' atdrivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:283:2,    inlined from 'kref_put' at include/linux/kref.h:65:3,    inlined from 'carl9170_tx_put_skb' atdrivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:342:9:include/linux/fortify-string.h:493:25: error: call to'__write_overflow_field' declared with attribute warning: detected writebeyond size of field (1st parameter); maybe use struct_group()?[-Werror=attribute-warning]  493 |                         __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size);Kees previously tried to avoid this by using memset_after(), but it seemsthis does not fully address the problem. I noticed that the memset_after()here is done on a different part of the union (status) than the originalcast was from (rate_driver_data), which may confuse the compiler.Unfortunately, the memset_after() trick does not work on driver_rates[]because that is part of an anonymous struct, and I could not getstruct_group() to do this either. Using two separate memset() callson the two members does address the warning though.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38616` to fix the vulnerability.
