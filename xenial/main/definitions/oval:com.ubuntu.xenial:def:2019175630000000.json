		"Title": "CVE-2019-17563 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "When using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0 to 8.5.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-17563` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibservlet3.1-java - 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.11\nlibtomcat8-java - 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.11\ntomcat8 - 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.11\ntomcat8-admin - 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.11\ntomcat8-common - 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.11\ntomcat8-examples - 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.11\ntomcat8-user - 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.11\nNo subscription required",
