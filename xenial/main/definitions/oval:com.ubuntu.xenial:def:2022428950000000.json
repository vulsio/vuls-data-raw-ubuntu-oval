    "Title": "CVE-2022-42895 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "There is an infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_parse_conf_req function which can be used to leak kernel pointers remotely. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b1a2cd50c0357f243b7435a732b4e62ba3157a2e https://www.google.com/url Tamás Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
