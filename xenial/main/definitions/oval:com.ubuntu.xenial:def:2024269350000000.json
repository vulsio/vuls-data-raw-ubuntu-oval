		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regressionCommit fc663711b944 (\"scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}directory earlier\") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, byadding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that ledto a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's alsocalled from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (\"scsi: core: Fix a procfs hostdirectory removal regression\"). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() callfrom dev_release().But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),and that function \"pairs\" with scsi_host_dev_release(), whilescsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems thereason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to covercases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call toscsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in someerror paths, for example.Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing onusb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can seethat the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI hostallocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leadsto messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host procstructure):usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detectedproc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registeredWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even acomment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional ismeant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storagedoes not trigger the warning anymore.",
