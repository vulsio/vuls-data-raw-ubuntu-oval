		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: synproxy: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options The TCPoption parser in synproxy (synproxy_parse_options) could read one byte outof bounds. When the length is 1, the execution flow gets into the loop,reads one byte of the opcode, and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL norTCPOPT_NOP, it reads one more byte, which exceeds the length of 1. This fixis inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (\"ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack out ofbounds when parsing TCP options.\"). v2 changes: Added an early return whenlength < 0 to avoid calling skb_header_pointer with negative length.",
