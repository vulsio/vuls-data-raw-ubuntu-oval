		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: synproxy: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options The TCPoption parser in synproxy (synproxy_parse_options) could read one byte outof bounds. When the length is 1, the execution flow gets into the loop,reads one byte of the opcode, and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL norTCPOPT_NOP, it reads one more byte, which exceeds the length of 1. This fixis inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (\"ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack out ofbounds when parsing TCP options.\"). v2 changes: Added an early return whenlength < 0 to avoid calling skb_header_pointer with negative length.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47245` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
