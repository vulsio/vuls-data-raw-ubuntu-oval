		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/qeth: fix deadlock during failing recovery Commit 0b9902c1fcc5(\"s390/qeth: fix deadlock during recovery\") removed taking discipline_mutexinside qeth_do_reset(), fixing potential deadlocks. An error path wasmissed though, that still takes discipline_mutex and thus has the originaldeadlock potential. Intermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channelpath is configured offline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset andccwgroup_remove. Call qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset()error case and then a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without takingdiscipline_mutex.",
