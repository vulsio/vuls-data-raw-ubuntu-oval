		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Inpxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameterhas a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow andbypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the thirdargument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the originaldiscoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39842` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
