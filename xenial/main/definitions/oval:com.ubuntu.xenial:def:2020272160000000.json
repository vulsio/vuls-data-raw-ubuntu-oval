A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporarysub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete thecreation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race thenthey will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpackweb applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. Ifany code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead toa local privilege escalation vulnerability.",
