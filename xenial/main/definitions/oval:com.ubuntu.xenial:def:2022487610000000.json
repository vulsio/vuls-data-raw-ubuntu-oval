This problem washidden by power domain driver, which call run time resume before it. Butthe below commit remove it and make this issue happen. commit c1df456d0f06e(\"PM: domains: Don't runtime resume devices at genpd_prepare()\") This patchcall run time resume before suspend to make sure clock is on before accessregister.
