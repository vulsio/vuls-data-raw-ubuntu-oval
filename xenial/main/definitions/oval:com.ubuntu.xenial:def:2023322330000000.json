		"Title": "CVE-2023-32233 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled. Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
