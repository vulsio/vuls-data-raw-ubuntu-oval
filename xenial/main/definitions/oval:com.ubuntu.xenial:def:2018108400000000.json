		"Title": "CVE-2018-10840 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "Linux kernel is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the fs/ext4/xattr.c:ext4_xattr_set_entry() function. An attacker could exploit this by operating on a mounted crafted ext4 image. Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10840` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
