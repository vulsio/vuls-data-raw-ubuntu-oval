		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. x86 PV guest kernels canexperience denial of service via SYSENTER. The SYSENTER instruction leavesvarious state sanitization activities to software. One of Xen'ssanitization paths injects a #GP fault, and incorrectly delivers it twiceto the guest. This causes the guest kernel to observe a kernel-privilege#GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege #GP fault (usuallyconverted into SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can crash theguest kernel, resulting in a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platformsare not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instructionin 64bit mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be Intel, Centaur, andShanghai CPUs. AMD and Hygon CPUs are not believed to be vulnerable. Onlyx86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 PVH / HVM guests cannotexploit the vulnerability.",
