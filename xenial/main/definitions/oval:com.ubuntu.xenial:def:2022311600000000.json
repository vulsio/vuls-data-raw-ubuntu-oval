		"Title": "CVE-2022-31160 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects,widgets, and themes built on top of jQuery. Versions prior to 1.13.2 arepotentially vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Initializing acheckboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that parentlabel contents considered as the input label. Calling `.checkboxradio(\"refresh\" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML contained encoded HTMLentities will make them erroneously get decoded. This can lead topotentially executing JavaScript code. The bug has been patched in jQueryUI 1.13.2. To remediate the issue, someone who can change the initial HTMLcan wrap all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`.",
