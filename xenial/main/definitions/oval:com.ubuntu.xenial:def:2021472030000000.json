		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq()When parsing the txq list in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to passthe requests to the adapter. If such an attempt fails, a local \"fail_msg\"string is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to acompletions list for cancellation.Processing of any further jobs from the txq list continues, but since\"fail_msg\" remains set, jobs are added to the completions list regardlessof whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added totxcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in list corruption.Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completionslist. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to the completionslist unless they had an appropriate failure.",
