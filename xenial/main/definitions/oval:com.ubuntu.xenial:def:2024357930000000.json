Turns out that despiteall the review on the locking, we missed completely that thelogic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (andneed not wait for the completion), but if it doesn't we haveto trigger all the cancellations. As written, we can _never_get into the loop triggering the cancellations. Fix this, andexplain it better while at it.",
