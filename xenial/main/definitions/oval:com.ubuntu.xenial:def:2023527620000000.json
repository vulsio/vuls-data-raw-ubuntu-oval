		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:virtio-blk: fix implicit overflow on virtio_max_dma_size The followingcodes have an implicit conversion from size_t to u32: (u32)max_size =(size_t)virtio_max_dma_size(vdev); This may lead overflow, Ex (size_t)4G ->(u32)0. Once virtio_max_dma_size() has a larger size than U32_MAX, useU32_MAX instead.",
