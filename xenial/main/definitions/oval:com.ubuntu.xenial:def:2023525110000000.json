		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: sun6i: reduce DMA RX transfer width to single byteThrough empirical testing it has been determined that sometimes RX SPItransfers with DMA enabled return corrupted data. This is down to singleor even multiple bytes lost during DMA transfer from SPI peripheral tomemory. It seems the RX FIFO within the SPI peripheral can becomeconfused when performing bus read accesses wider than a single byte to itduring an active SPI transfer.This patch reduces the width of individual DMA read accesses to theRX FIFO to a single byte to mitigate that issue.",
