		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:uio_hv_generic: Don't free decrypted memory In CoCo VMs it is possible forthe untrusted host to cause set_memory_encrypted() orset_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned and theresulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care to handle theseerrors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator,which could lead to functional or security issues. The VMBus device UIOdriver could free decrypted/shared pages if set_memory_decrypted() fails.Check the decrypted field in the gpadl to decide whether to free thememory.",
