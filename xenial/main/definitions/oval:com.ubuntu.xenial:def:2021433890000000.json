		"Title": "CVE-2021-43389 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c. It was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations that could trigger an array out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.",
