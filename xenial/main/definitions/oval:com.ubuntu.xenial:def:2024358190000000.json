Although this bug has existed for a while, itwas not apparent until commit ef2a8d5478b9 (\"net: dpaa: Adjust queue depthon rate change\") which invokes smp_call_function_single viaqman_update_cgr_safe every time a link goes up or down.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35819` to fix the vulnerability.
