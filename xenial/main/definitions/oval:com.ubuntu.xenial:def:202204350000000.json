		"Title": "CVE-2022-0435 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network. Samuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.",
