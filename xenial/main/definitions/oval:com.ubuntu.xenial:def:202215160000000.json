		"Title": "CVE-2022-1516 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s X.25 set of standardized network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. It was discovered that the implementation of X.25 network protocols in the Linux kernel did not terminate link layer sessions properly. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
