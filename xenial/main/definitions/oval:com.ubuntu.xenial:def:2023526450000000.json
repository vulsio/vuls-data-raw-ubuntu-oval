		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pmdomain: mediatek: fix race conditions with genpd If the power domains areregistered first with genpd and *after that* the driver attempts to powerthem on in the probe sequence, then it is possible that a race conditionoccurs if genpd tries to power them on in the same time. The same is validfor powering them off before unregistering them from genpd. Attempt to fixrace conditions by first removing the domains from genpd and *after that*powering down domains. Also first power up the domains and *after that*register them to genpd.",
