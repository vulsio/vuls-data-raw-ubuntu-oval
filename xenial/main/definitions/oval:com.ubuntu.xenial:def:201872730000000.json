		"Title": "CVE-2018-7273 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - negligible.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 4.15.4, the floppy driver reveals the addresses of kernel functions and global variables using printk calls within the function show_floppy in drivers/block/floppy.c. An attacker can read this information from dmesg and use the addresses to find the locations of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR. It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel could report kernel pointers via dmesg. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-7273` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1030-aws - 4.15.0-1030.31~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-azure - 4.15.0-1013.13~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1014-gcp - 4.15.0-1014.14~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1030-aws - 4.15.0-1030.31~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-azure - 4.15.0-1013.13~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1014-gcp - 4.15.0-1014.14~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
