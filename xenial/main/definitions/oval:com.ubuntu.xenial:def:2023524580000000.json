		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block sizeBefore calling add partition or resize partition, there is no checkon whether the length is aligned with the logical block size.If the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes,then the partition size maybe not the multiple of the logical block size,and when the last sector is read, bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size,resulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller thanthe logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will alsoresult in a null pointer dereference when calling bio_integrity_free.",
