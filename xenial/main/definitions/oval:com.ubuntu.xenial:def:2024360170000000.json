		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validation Eachattribute inside a nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST is assumed to be a structifla_vf_vlan_info so the size of such attribute needs to be at least ofsizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes. The current sizevalidation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes) which is lessthan sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) so this validation is not enough anda too small attribute might be cast to a struct ifla_vf_vlan_info, thismight result in an out of bands read access when accessing the saved(casted) entry in ivvl.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36017` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
