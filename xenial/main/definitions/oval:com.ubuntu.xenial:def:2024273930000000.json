		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen-netfront: Add missing skb_mark_for_recycle Notice thatskb_mark_for_recycle() is introduced later than fixes tag in commit6a5bcd84e886 (\"page_pool: Allow drivers to hint on SKB recycling\"). It isbelieved that fixes tag were missing a call to page_pool_release_page()between v5.9 to v5.14, after which is should have usedskb_mark_for_recycle(). Since v6.6 the call page_pool_release_page() wereremoved (in commit 535b9c61bdef (\"net: page_pool: hidepage_pool_release_page()\") and remaining callers converted (in commit6bfef2ec0172 (\"Merge branch'net-page_pool-remove-page_pool_release_page'\")). This leak became visiblein v6.8 via commit dba1b8a7ab68 (\"mm/page_pool: catch page_pool memoryleaks\").",
