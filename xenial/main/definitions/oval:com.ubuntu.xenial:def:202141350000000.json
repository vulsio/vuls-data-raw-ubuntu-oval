		"Title": "CVE-2021-4135 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A memory leak vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF for the Simulated networking device driver in the way user uses BPF for the device such that function nsim_map_alloc_elem being called. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. It was discovered that the simulated networking device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
