		"Title": "CVE-2023-0461 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high",
		"Description": "There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can beexploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerabilitykernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to beconfigured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is ause-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. WhenCONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context)on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket isdisconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from thelistener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULPoperation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading pastcommit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c",
