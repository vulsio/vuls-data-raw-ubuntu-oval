		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:hda: intel-sdw-acpi: harden detection of controller The existing codecurrently sets a pointer to an ACPI handle before checking that it'sactually a SoundWire controller. This can lead to issues where the graphwalk continues and eventually fails, but the pointer was set already. Thispatch changes the logic so that the information provided to the caller isset when a controller is found.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46926` to fix the vulnerability.
