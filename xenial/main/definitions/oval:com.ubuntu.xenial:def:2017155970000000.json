		"Title": "CVE-2017-15597 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made an implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference. Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of Service. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.",
