		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu/fence: Fix oops due to non-matching drm_sched init/finiCurrently amdgpu calls drm_sched_fini() from the fence driver sw finiroutine - such function is expected to be called only after therespective init function - drm_sched_init() - was executed successfully.Happens that we faced a driver probe failure in the Steam Deckrecently, and the function drm_sched_fini() was called even withoutits counter-part had been previously called, causing the following oops:amdgpu: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -110BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000090PGD 0 P4D 0Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTICPU: 0 PID: 609 Comm: systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.2.0-rc3-gpiccoli #338Hardware name: Valve Jupiter/Jupiter, BIOS F7A0113 11/04/2022RIP: 0010:drm_sched_fini+0x84/0xa0 [gpu_sched][...]Call Trace: <TASK> amdgpu_fence_driver_sw_fini+0xc8/0xd0 [amdgpu] amdgpu_device_fini_sw+0x2b/0x3b0 [amdgpu] amdgpu_driver_release_kms+0x16/0x30 [amdgpu] devm_drm_dev_init_release+0x49/0x70 [...]To prevent that, check if the drm_sched was properly initialized for agiven ring before calling its fini counter-part.Notice ideally we'd use sched.ready for that; such field is set as thelatestthing on drm_sched_init(). But amdgpu seems to \"override\" the meaning ofsuchfield - in the above oops for example, it was a GFX ring causing the crash,andthe sched.ready field was set to true in the ring init routine, regardlessofthe state of the DRM scheduler. Hence, we ended-up using sched.ops as perChristian's suggestion [0], and also removed the no_scheduler check [1].[0]https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx/984ee981-2906-0eaf-ccec-9f80975cb136@amd.com/[1]https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx/cd0e2994-f85f-d837-609f-7056d5fb7231@amd.com/",
