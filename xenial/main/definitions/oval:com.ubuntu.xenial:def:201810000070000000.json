		"Title": "CVE-2018-1000007 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data tothird parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests,libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URLbut also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code isreturned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response headervalue. Sending the same set of headers to subsequent hosts is in particulara problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, asthis header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that couldallow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1000007` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nNo subscription required",
