		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Arm guest OS usersto cause a hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check inVCPUOP_register_vcpu_info. The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is usedby a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor. The region willbe mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly accessed. On Arm,the region is accessed with instructions that require a specific alignment.Unfortunately, there is no check that the address provided by the guestwill be correctly aligned. As a result, a malicious guest could cause ahypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address. A malicious guestadministrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial ofService (DoS). All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems arevulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.",
