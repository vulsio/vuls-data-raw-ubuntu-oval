		"title": "CVE-2021-27363 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernelpointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transportstructure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem,the transport's handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfsfile system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. Whenread, the show_transport_handle function (indrivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle.This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in thekernel module's global variables.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-27363` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1148-raspi2 - 4.4.0-1148.158\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1152-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1152.162\nNo subscription required",
