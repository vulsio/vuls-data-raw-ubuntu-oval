		"title": "CVE-2024-43890 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()\"tracing_map->next_elt\" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_mapeven though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached.Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in thetracing_map containing \"tracing_map->max_size\" elements, leaving no emptyentries.If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using`__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemptiondisabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.Fix this by preventing any further increments to \"tracing_map->next_elt\"once it reaches \"tracing_map->max_elt\".\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43890` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
