    "Title": "CVE-2022-31608 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in an optional D-Bus configuration file, where a local user with basic capabilities can impact protected D-Bus endpoints, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. Artem S. Tashkinov discovered that the NVIDIA graphics drivers Dynamic Boost D-Bus component did not properly restrict access to its endpoint. When enabled in non-default configurations, a local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
