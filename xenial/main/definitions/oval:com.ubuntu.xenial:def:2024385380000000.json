		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:bridge: xmit: make sure we have at least eth header len bytes syzbottriggered an uninit value[1] error in bridge device's xmit path by sendinga short (less than ETH_HLEN bytes) skb. To fix it check if we can actuallypull that amount instead of assuming.
