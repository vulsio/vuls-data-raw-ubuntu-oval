		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:l2tp: pass correct message length to ip6_append_datal2tp_ip6_sendmsg needs to avoid accounting for the transport headertwice when splicing more data into an already partially-occupied skbuff.To manage this, we check whether the skbuff contains data usingskb_queue_empty when deciding how much data to append usingip6_append_data.However, the code which performed the calculation was incorrect:     ulen = len + skb_queue_empty(&sk->sk_write_queue) ? transhdrlen : 0;...due to C operator precedence, this ends up setting ulen totranshdrlen for messages with a non-zero length, which results incorrupted packets on the wire.Add parentheses to correct the calculation in line with the originalintent.",
