		"description": "Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and thentruncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is theorder of the elliptic curve. Meaning k = r mod n. The division usedduring the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the upper twodigits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit ofn and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size.Observing the number of times q_e is decremented through a control-flowrevealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits ofk. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or asignificant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reductionmethods. For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits.",
