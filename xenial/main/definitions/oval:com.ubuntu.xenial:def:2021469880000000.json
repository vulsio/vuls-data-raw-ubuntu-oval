		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ONConsider the following sequence of events:1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which ends up calling into   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account the blocks, we   shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. We return   -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated.2. Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after   dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte().3. Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used.4. So shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and   immediately returns - without releasing the page.This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller, which asserts that the pageshould always be consumed, unless -ENOENT is returned.To fix this, detect if we have such a \"dangling\" page when accountingfails, and if so, release it before returning.",
