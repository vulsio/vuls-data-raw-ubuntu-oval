		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix out-of-bounds access in ops_init net_alloc_generic is called bynet_alloc, which is called without any locking. It reads max_gen_ptrs,which is changed under pernet_ops_rwsem. It is read twice, first toallocate an array, then to set s.len, which is later used to limit thebounds of the array access. It is possible that the array is allocated andanother thread is registering a new pernet ops, increments max_gen_ptrs,which is then used to set s.len with a larger than allocated length for thevariable array. Fix it by reading max_gen_ptrs only once innet_alloc_generic. If max_gen_ptrs is later incremented, it will be caughtin net_assign_generic.",
