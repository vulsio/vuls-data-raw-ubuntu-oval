		"description": "Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, deleteand modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds readwas found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-lineutility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying themetadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 isused to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker couldpotentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service bycrashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on acrafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing themetadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading themetadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-lineapplication, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as`insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Please see our securitypolicy for information about Exiv2 security.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29473` to fix the vulnerability.
