		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration Multiple ttys tryto claim the same the minor number causing a double unregistration of thesame device. The first unregistration succeeds but the next one results ina null-ptr-deref. The get_free_serial_index() function returns an availableminor number but doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done bythe caller later. But before this assignment, calls toget_free_serial_index() would return the same minor number. Fix this bymodifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number immediatelyafter one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor() to better reflectwhat it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index() to release_minor() andmodify it to free up the minor number of the given hso_serial. Everyobtain_minor() should have corresponding release_minor() call.",
