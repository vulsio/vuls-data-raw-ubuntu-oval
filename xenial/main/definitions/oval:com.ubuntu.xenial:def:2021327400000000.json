		"description": "Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation thatis part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumptionvulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within theURI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted templatemay result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial ofservice when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would notnormally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previoussecurity advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Usersof the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI templatecapabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0.As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources thathave been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.",
