		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issueIn rkisp1_isp_stop() and rkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks theinterrupts and then apparently assumes that the interrupt handler won'tbe running, and proceeds in the stop procedure. This is not the case, asthe interrupt handler can already be running, which would lead to theISP being disabled while the interrupt handler handling a capturedframe.This brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while theinterrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading toboard lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code thatdisables the streaming might do things that conflict.It is not clear to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can be seen witha suitable delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler,leading to board lockup.",
