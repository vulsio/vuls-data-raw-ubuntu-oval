    "Title": "CVE-2023-2430 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found due to missing lock for IOPOLL flaw in io_cqring_event_overflow() in io_uring.c in Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privilege to trigger a Denial of Service threat. Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking when IOPOLL mode is being used. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
