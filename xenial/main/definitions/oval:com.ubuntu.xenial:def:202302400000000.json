		"Description": "There is a logic error in io_uring's implementation which can be used totrigger a use-after-free vulnerability leading to privilege escalation. Inthe io_prep_async_work function the assumption that the lastio_grab_identity call cannot return false is not true, and in this case thefunction will use the init_cred or the previous linked requests identity todo operations instead of using the current identity. This can lead toreference counting issues causing use-after-free. We recommend upgradingpast version 5.10.161.",
