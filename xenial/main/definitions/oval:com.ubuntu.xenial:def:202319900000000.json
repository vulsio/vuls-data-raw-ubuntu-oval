		"Title": "CVE-2023-1990 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in ndlc_remove in drivers/nfc/st-nci/ndlc.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow an attacker to crash the system due to a race problem. It was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
