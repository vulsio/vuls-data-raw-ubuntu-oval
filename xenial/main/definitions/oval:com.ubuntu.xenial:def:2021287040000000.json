		"description": "PoD operations on misaligned GFNs T[his CNA information record relates tomultiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspondto which CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH guests may be started in populate-on-demand(PoD) mode, to provide a way for them to later easily have more memoryassigned. Guests are permitted to control certain P2M aspects of individualpages via hypercalls. These hypercalls may act on ranges of pages specifiedvia page orders (resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). Theimplementation of some of these hypercalls for PoD does not enforce thebase page frame number to be suitably aligned for the specified order, yetsome code involved in PoD handling actually makes such an assumption. Theseoperations are XENMEM_decrease_reservation (CVE-2021-28704) andXENMEM_populate_physmap (CVE-2021-28707), the latter usable only by domainscontrolling the guest, i.e. a de-privileged qemu or a stub domain. (Patch1, combining the fix to both these two issues.) In addition handling ofXENMEM_decrease_reservation can also trigger a host crash when thespecified page order is neither 4k nor 2M nor 1G (CVE-2021-28708, patch 2).",
