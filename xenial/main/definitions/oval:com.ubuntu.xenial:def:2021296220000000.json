		"description": "Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. In2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure aseamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bugin the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that canredirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint. If a user visits aprometheus server with a specially crafted address, they can be redirectedto an arbitrary URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. Theworkaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front ofPrometheus.",
