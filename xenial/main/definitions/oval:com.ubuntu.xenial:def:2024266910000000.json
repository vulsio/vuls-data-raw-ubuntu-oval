		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: arm64: Fix circular locking dependencyThe rule inside kvm enforces that the vcpu->mutex is taken *inside*kvm->lock. The rule is violated by the pkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquiresthe kvm->lock while already holding the vcpu->mutex lock fromkvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular locking dependency altogether byprotecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock, much like we alreadydo for other forms of VM-scoped data.",
