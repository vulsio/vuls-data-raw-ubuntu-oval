		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: uio:Fix use-after-free in uio_open core-1 core-2-------------------------------------------------------uio_unregister_device uio_open idev = idr_find()device_unregister(&idev->dev) put_device(&idev->dev) uio_device_releaseget_device(&idev->dev) kfree(idev) uio_free_minor(minor) uio_releaseput_device(&idev->dev) kfree(idev)------------------------------------------------------- In the core-1uio_unregister_device(), the device_unregister will kfree idev when theidev->dev kobject ref is 1. But after core-1 device_unregister, put_deviceand before doing kfree, the core-2 may get_device. Then: 1. After core-1kfree idev, the core-2 will do use-after-free for idev. 2. When core-2 douio_release and put_device, the idev will be double freed. To address thisissue, we can get idev atomic & inc idev reference with minor_lock.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52439` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
