		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: regmap:spi: Reserve space for register address/padding Currently the max_raw_readand max_raw_write limits in regmap_spi struct do not take into account theadditional size of the transmitted register address and padding. This mayresult in exceeding the maximum permitted SPI message size, which couldcause undefined behaviour, e.g. data corruption. Fix regmap_get_spi_bus()to properly adjust the above mentioned limits by reserving space for theregister address/padding as set in the regmap configuration.",
