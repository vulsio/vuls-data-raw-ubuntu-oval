    "Title": "CVE-2023-4692 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue may allow an attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS filesystem image, leading to grub's heap metadata corruption. In some circumstances, the attack may also corrupt the UEFI firmware heap metadata. As a result, arbitrary code execution and secure boot protection bypass may be achieved. It was discovered that a specially crafted file system image could cause a heap-based out-of-bounds write. An attacker could potentially use this to perform arbitrary code execution bypass and bypass secure boot protections.",
