		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw headerFix the checking that firmware file buffer is large enough for thewmfw header, to prevent overrunning the buffer.The original code tested that the firmware data buffer containedenough bytes for the sums of the size of the structs\twmfw_header + wmfw_adsp1_sizes + wmfw_footerBut wmfw_adsp1_sizes is only used on ADSP1 firmware. For ADSP2 andHalo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes, which is4 bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that thereare enough bytes in the firmware buffer for a header withwmfw_adsp2_sizes.This patch splits the length check into three separate parts. Eachof the wmfw_header, wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checkedseparately before they are used.",
