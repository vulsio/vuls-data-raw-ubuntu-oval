		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pwm:Fix double shift bug These enums are passed to set/test_bit(). Theset/test_bit() functions take a bit number instead of a shifted value.Passing a shifted value is a double shift bug like doing BIT(BIT(1)). Thedouble shift bug doesn't cause a problem here because we are only checking0 and 1 but if the value was 5 or above then it can lead to a bufferoverflow.",
