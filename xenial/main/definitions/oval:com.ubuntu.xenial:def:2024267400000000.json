		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_mirred: use the backlog for mirred ingressThe test Davide added in commit ca22da2fbd69 (\"act_mirred: use the backlogfor nested calls to mirred ingress\") hangs our testing VMs every 10 or soruns, with the familiar tcp_v4_rcv -> tcp_v4_rcv deadlock reported bylockdep.The problem as previously described by Davide (see Link) is thatif we reverse flow of traffic with the redirect (egress -> ingress)we may reach the same socket which generated the packet. And we maystill be holding its socket lock. The common solution to such deadlocksis to put the packet in the Rx backlog, rather than run the Rx pathinline. Do that for all egress -> ingress reversals, not just oncewe started to nest mirred calls.In the past there was a concern that the backlog indirection willlead to loss of error reporting / less accurate stats. But the currentworkaround does not seem to address the issue.",
