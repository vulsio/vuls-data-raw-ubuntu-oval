When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals from atrusted system service such as NetworkManager on a shared computer, otherusers of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that theGDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by thetrusted system service. This could lead to the GDBus-based client behavingincorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.",
