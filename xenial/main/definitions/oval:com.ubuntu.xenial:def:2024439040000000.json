		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Add null checks for 'stream' and 'plane' beforedereferencingThis commit adds null checks for the 'stream' and 'plane' variables inthe dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations function. These variables werepreviously assumed to be null at line 922, but they were used later inthe code without checking if they were null. This could potentially leadto a null pointer dereference, which would cause a crash.The null checks ensure that 'stream' and 'plane' are not null beforethey are used, preventing potential crashes.Fixes the below static smatch checker:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:938dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed'stream' could be null (see line 922)drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:940dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed 'plane'could be null (see line 922)",
