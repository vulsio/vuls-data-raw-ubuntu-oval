		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/panthor: Restrict high priorities on group_createWe were allowing any users to create a high priority group without anypermission checks. As a result, this was allowing possible denial ofservice.We now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICEcapability to set higher priorities than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.As the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode a value ofMEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.Additionally, as those checks are performed at the ioctl level,panthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.[1]https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/f390835074bdf162a63deb0311d1a6de527f9f89/src/gallium/drivers/panfrost/pan_csf.c#L1038",
