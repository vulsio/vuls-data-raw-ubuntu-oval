When the ax25 device is shutting down, theax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device oneor zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which willcause memory leak.In order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count ofnet_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.",
