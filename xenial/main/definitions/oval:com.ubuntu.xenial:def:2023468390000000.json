		"description": "PCI devices can make use of a functionality called phantom functions, thatwhen enabled allows the device to generate requests using the IDs offunctions that are otherwise unpopulated. This allows a device to extendthe number of outstanding requests. Such phantom functions need an IOMMUcontext setup, but failure to setup the context is not fatal when thedevice is assigned. Not failing device assignment when such failure happenscan lead to the primary device being assigned to a guest, while some of thephantom functions are assigned to a different domain.",
