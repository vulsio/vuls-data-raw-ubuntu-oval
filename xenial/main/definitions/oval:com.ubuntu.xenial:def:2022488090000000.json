		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadataWhen uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata, a newdst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb.This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specificskb.The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of1, which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. Whentun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from asingle place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will neverdrop to 0 (when the skb is consumed), leading to a memory leak.Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as thedst+metadata refcount is already 1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48809` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-lowlatency - 4.15.0-177.186~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1128-aws - 4.15.0-1128.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-gcp - 4.15.0-1122.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-oracle - 4.15.0-1093.102~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
