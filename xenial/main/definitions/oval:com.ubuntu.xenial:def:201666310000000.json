		"Title": "CVE-2016-6631 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. A user can execute a remote code execution attack against a server when phpMyAdmin is being run as a CGI application. Under certain server configurations, a user can pass a query string which is executed as a command-line argument by the file generator_plugin.sh. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected. It was discovered that phpmyadmin incorrectly handled request query strings. An attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-6631` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpmyadmin - 4:4.5.4.1-2ubuntu2.1\nNo subscription required",
