		"description": "Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr. Thisissue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before9.3.0. One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Javasystem properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide systemproperties that had \"password\" contained in the name. There are a number ofsensitive system properties, such as \"basicauth\" and \"aws.secretKey\" do notcontain \"password\", thus their values were published via the\"/admin/info/properties\" endpoint. This endpoint populates the list ofSystem Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making theexposed credentials visible in the UI. This /admin/info/properties endpointis protected under the \"config-read\" permission. Therefore, Solr Cloudswith Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in usersthat have the \"config-read\" permission. Users are recommended to upgrade toversion 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue. A single option nowcontrols hiding Java system property for all endpoints,\"-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps\". By default all known sensitive properties arehidden (including \"-Dbasicauth\"), as well as any property with a namecontaining \"secret\" or \"password\". Users who cannot upgrade can also usethe following Java system property to fix the issue:'-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'",
