		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: mark bpf_dummy_struct_ops.test_1 parameter as nullableTest case dummy_st_ops/dummy_init_ret_value passes NULL as the firstparameter of the test_1() function. Mark this parameter as nullable tomake verifier aware of such possibility.Otherwise, NULL check in the test_1() code:      SEC(\"struct_ops/test_1\")      int BPF_PROG(test_1, struct bpf_dummy_ops_state *state)      {            if (!state)                    return ...;            ... access state ...      }Might be removed by verifier, thus triggering NULL pointer dereferenceunder certain conditions.",
