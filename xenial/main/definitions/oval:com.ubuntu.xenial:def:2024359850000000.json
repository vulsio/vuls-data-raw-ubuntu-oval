		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/eevdf: Prevent vlag from going out of bounds in reweight_eevdf() Itwas possible to have pick_eevdf() return NULL, which then causes aNULL-deref. This turned out to be due to entity_eligible() returningfalsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow. Specifically,reweight_eevdf() computes the vlag without considering the limit placedupon vlag as update_entity_lag() does, and then the scaling multiplication(remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) can overflow. This then leadsto the new vruntime being weird which then causes the aboveentity_eligible() to go side-ways and claim nothing is eligible. Thus limitthe range of vlag accordingly. All this was quite rare, but fatal when itdoes happen.",
