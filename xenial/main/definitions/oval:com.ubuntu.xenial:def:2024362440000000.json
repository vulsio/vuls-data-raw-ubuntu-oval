		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle tooIt is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by theblamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits acycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of entryintervals. We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle timeitself must be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number ofschedule entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether thecycle time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value,so we move the existing \"cycle == 0\" check outside the \"if\"(!new->cycle_time)\" branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36244` to fix the vulnerability.
