		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/pci: Disable auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQCurrently for devices requiring masking at the irqchip for INTx, ie.devices without DisINTx support, the IRQ is enabled in request_irq()and subsequently disabled as necessary to align with the masked statusflag.  This presents a window where the interrupt could fire betweenthese events, resulting in the IRQ incrementing the disable depth twice.This would be unrecoverable for a user since the masked flag preventsnested enables through vfio.Instead, invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive INTxis never auto-enabled, then unmask as required.",
