		"Title": "CVE-2021-34556 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.13.7, an unprivileged BPF program can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a Speculative Store Bypass side-channel attack because the protection mechanism neglects the possibility of uninitialized memory locations on the BPF stack. Benedict Schlueter discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side- channel attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
