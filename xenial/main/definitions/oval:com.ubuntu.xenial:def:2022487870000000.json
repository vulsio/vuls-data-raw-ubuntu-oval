		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iwlwifi: fix use-after-freeIf no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of thefirmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by callingdevice_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then iniwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. Howeverthe new code I added will still erroneously access it after itwas freed.Set 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all datawas already freed anyway.",
