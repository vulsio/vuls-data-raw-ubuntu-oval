		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvme-fc: do not wait in vain when unloading module The module exit path hasrace between deleting all controllers and freeing 'left over IDs'. Toprevent double free a synchronization between nvme_delete_ctrl andida_destroy has been added by the initial commit. There is some logicaround trying to prevent from hanging forever in wait_for_completion,though it does not handling all cases. E.g. blktests is able to reproducethe situation where the module unload hangs forever. If we completely relyon the cleanup code executed from the nvme_delete_ctrl path, all IDs willbe freed eventually. This makes calling ida_destroy unnecessary. We onlyhave to ensure that all nvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before weleave nvme_fc_exit_module. This is done by flushing the nvme_delete_wqworkqueue. While at it, remove the unused nvme_fc_wq workqueue too.",
