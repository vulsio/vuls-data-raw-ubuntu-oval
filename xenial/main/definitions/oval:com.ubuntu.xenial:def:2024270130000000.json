		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tun:limit printing rate when illegal packet received by tun dev vhost_workerwill call tun call backs to receive packets. If too many illegal packetsarrives, tun_do_read will keep dumping packet contents. When console isenabled, it will costs much more cpu time to dump packet and soft lockupwill be detected. net_ratelimit mechanism can be used to limit the dumpingrate.
