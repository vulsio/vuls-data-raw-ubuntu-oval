		"description": "In some situations, the Image module does not correctly check access toimage files not stored in the standard public files directory whengenerating derivative images using the image styles system. Access to anon-public file is checked only if it is stored in the \"private\" filesystem. However, some contributed modules provide additional file systems,or schemes, which may lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability ismitigated by the fact that it only applies when the site sets (Drupal 9)$config['image.settings']['allow_insecure_derivatives'] or (Drupal 7)$conf['image_allow_insecure_derivatives'] to TRUE. The recommended anddefault setting is FALSE, and Drupal core does not provide a way to changethat in the admin UI. Some sites may require configuration changesfollowing this security release. Review the release notes for your Drupalversion if you have issues accessing files or image styles after updating.",
