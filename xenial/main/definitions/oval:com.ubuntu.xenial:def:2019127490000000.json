		"Title": "CVE-2019-12749 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, asused in DBusServer in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, lesscommon, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of symlinkmishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in thelibdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authenticationmechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directorycould manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with adifferent uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case,this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to themalicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequentclient connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authenticationbypass.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-12749` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndbus - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\ndbus-tests - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\ndbus-user-session - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\ndbus-x11 - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\nlibdbus-1-3 - 1.10.6-1ubuntu3.4\nNo subscription required",
