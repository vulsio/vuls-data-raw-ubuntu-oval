		"Title": "CVE-2022-2905 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem in how a user calls the bpf_tail_call function with a key larger than the max_entries of the map. This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data. Hsin-Wei Hung discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the x86 JIT compiler. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
