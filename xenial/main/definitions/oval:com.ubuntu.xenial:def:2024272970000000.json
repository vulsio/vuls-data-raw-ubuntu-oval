A fixed-outputderivations on Linux can send file descriptors to files in the Nix store toanother program running on the host (or another fixed-output derivation)via Unix domain sockets in the abstract namespace. This allows to modifythe output of the derivation, after Nix has registered the path as \"valid\"and immutable in the Nix database. In particular, this allows the output offixed-output derivations to be modified from their expected content. Thisissue has been addressed in versions 2.3.18 2.18.2 2.19.4 and 2.20.5. Usersare advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for thisvulnerability.",
