		"Title": "CVE-2016-10030 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The _prolog_error function in slurmd/req.c in Slurm before 15.08.13, 16.xbefore 16.05.7, and 17.x before 17.02.0-pre4 has a vulnerability in how theslurmd daemon informs users of a Prolog failure on a compute node. Thatvulnerability could allow a user to assume control of an arbitrary file onthe system. Any exploitation of this is dependent on the user being able tocause or anticipate the failure (non-zero return code) of a Prolog scriptthat their job would run on. This issue affects all Slurm versions from0.6.0 (September 2005) to present. Workarounds to prevent exploitation ofthis are to either disable your Prolog script, or modify it such that italways returns 0 (\"success\") and adjust it to set the node as down usingscontrol instead of relying on the slurmd to handle that automatically. Ifyou do not have a Prolog set you are unaffected by this issue.",
