		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix information leakage in /proc/net/ptype In one net namespace, aftercreating a packet socket without binding it to a device, users in other netnamespaces can observe the new `packet_type` added by this packet socket byreading `/proc/net/ptype` file. This is minor information leakage as packetsocket is namespace aware. Add a net pointer in `packet_type` to keep thenet namespace of of corresponding packet socket. In `ptype_seq_show`, thisnet pointer must be checked when it is not NULL.",
