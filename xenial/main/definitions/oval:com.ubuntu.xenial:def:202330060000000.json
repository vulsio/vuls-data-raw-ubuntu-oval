		"Description": "A known cache speculation vulnerability, known as Branch History Injection(BHI) or Spectre-BHB, becomes actual again for the new hw AmpereOne.Spectre-BHB is similar to Spectre v2, except that malicious code uses theshared branch history (stored in the CPU Branch History Buffer, or BHB) toinfluence mispredicted branches within the victim's hardware context. Oncethat occurs, speculation caused by the mispredicted branches can causecache allocation. This issue leads to obtaining information that should notbe accessible.",
