Bram Moolenar (vim's BDFL) had this to say: 1) The permissions are the same as the original file, and that is exactly how it should be. 2) This is working as intended, Vim does not use umask this way.  Umask is only used by simple commands such as cp, not by long running processes that deal with many files. Problem is with the user expectations."
