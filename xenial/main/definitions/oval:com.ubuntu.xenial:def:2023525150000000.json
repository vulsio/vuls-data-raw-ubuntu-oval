		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/srp: Do not call scsi_done() from srp_abort() Afterscmd_eh_abort_handler() has called the SCSI LLD eh_abort_handler callback,it performs one of the following actions: * Call scsi_queue_insert(). *Call scsi_finish_command(). * Call scsi_eh_scmd_add(). Hence, SCSI aborthandlers must not call scsi_done(). Otherwise all the above actions wouldtrigger a use-after-free. Hence remove the scsi_done() call fromsrp_abort(). Keep the srp_free_req() call before returning SUCCESS becausewe may not see the command again if SUCCESS is returned.",
