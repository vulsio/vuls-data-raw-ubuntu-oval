		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mtd:Fix gluebi NULL pointer dereference caused by ftl notifier If both ftl.koand gluebi.ko are loaded, the notifier of ftl triggers NULL pointerdereference when trying to access ‘gluebi->desc’ in gluebi_read().ubi_gluebi_init ubi_register_volume_notifier ubi_enumerate_volumesubi_notify_all gluebi_notify nb->notifier_call() gluebi_createmtd_device_register mtd_device_parse_register add_mtd_deviceblktrans_notify_add not->add() ftl_add_mtd tr->add_mtd() scan_headermtd_read mtd_read_oob mtd_read_oob_std gluebi_read mtd->read() gluebi->desc- NULL Detailed reproduction information available at the Link [1], In thenormal case, obtain gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(), and accessgluebi->desc in the gluebi_read(). However, gluebi_get_device() is notexecuted in advance in the ftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULLpointer dereference. The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 onthe UBI volume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi from creatingthe mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the type MTD_UBIVOLUME.",
