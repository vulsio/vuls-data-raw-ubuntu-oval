		"title": "CVE-2024-0607 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issueis in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through aloop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written,but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes.That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous elementcorrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause adenial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-0607` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
