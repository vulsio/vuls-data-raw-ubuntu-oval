		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: f2fs:fix to avoid touching checkpointed data in get_victim() In CP disablingmode, there are two issues when using LFS or SSR | AT_SSR mode to selectvictim: 1. LFS is set to find source section during GC, the victim shouldhave no checkpointed data, since after GC, section could not be set freefor reuse. Previously, we only check valid chpt blocks in current segmentrather than section, fix it. 2. SSR | AT_SSR are set to find target segmentfor writes which can be fully filled by checkpointed and newly writtenblocks, we should never select such segment, otherwise it can cause panicor data corruption during allocation, potential case is described as below:a) target segment has 'n' (n < 512) ckpt valid blocks b) GC migrates 'n'valid blocks to other segment (segment is still in dirty list) c) GCmigrates '512 - n' blocks to target segment (segment has 'n' cp_vblocks and'512 - n' vblocks) d) If GC selects target segment via {AT,}SSR allocator,however there is no free space in targe segment.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47004` to fix the vulnerability.
