		"title": "CVE-2024-2494 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the RPC library APIs of libvirt. The RPC serverdeserialization code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negativelength check is performed by the C API entry points. Passing a negativelength to the g_new0 function results in a crash due to the negative lengthbeing treated as a huge positive number. This flaw allows a local,unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing thelibvirt daemon to crash.",
