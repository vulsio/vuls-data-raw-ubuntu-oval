    "Title": "CVE-2019-14378 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "ip_reass in ip_input.c in libslirp 4.0.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a large packet because it mishandles a case involving the first fragment. It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-14378` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nqemu - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-block-extra - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-guest-agent - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-kvm - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-aarch64 - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-arm - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-common - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-mips - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-misc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-ppc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-s390x - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-sparc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-system-x86 - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-user - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-user-binfmt - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-user-static - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nqemu-utils - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42\nNo subscription required",
