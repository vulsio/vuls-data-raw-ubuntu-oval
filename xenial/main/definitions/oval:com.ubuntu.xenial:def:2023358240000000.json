		"Title": "CVE-2023-35824 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in dm1105_remove in drivers/media/pci/dm1105/dm1105.c. It was discovered that the SDMC DM1105 PCI device driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
