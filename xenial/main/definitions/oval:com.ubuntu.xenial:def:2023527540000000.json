		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interfaceimon driver probes two USB interfaces, and at the probe of the secondinterface, the driver assumes blindly that the first interface gotbound with the same imon driver.  It's usually true, but it's stillpossible that the first interface is bound with another driver via amalformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption, asspotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata asstruct imon_context object although it's a completely different onethat was assigned by another driver.This patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface isreally bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problemabove at the probe time.",
