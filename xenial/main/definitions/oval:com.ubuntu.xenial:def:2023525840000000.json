		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spmi:mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove The pmif driver data that contains theclocks is allocated along with spmi_controller. On device remove,spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres , including theclocks, will be cleanup. This leads to UAF because putting the clocks willaccess the clocks in the pmif driver data, which is already freed alongwith spmi_controller. This can be reproduced by enablingDEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and building the kernel with KASAN. Fix the UAFissue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the clocks beforefreeing spmi_controller.",
