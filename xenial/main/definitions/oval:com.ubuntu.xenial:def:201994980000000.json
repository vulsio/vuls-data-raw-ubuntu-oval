		"Title": "CVE-2019-9498 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server, when built against a crypto library missing explicit validation on imported elements, do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. An attacker may be able to use invalid scalar/element values to complete authentication, gaining session key and network access without needing or learning the password. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9498` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhostapd - 2.4-0ubuntu6.4\nNo subscription required\n\nwpagui - 2.4-0ubuntu6.4\nwpasupplicant - 2.4-0ubuntu6.4\nNo subscription required",
