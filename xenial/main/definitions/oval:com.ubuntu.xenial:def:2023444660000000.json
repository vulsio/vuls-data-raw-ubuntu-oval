    "Title": "CVE-2023-44466 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in net/ceph/messenger_v2.c in the Linux kernel before 6.4.5. There is an integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow and remote code execution via HELLO or one of the AUTH frames. This occurs because of an untrusted length taken from a TCP packet in ceph_decode_32. Thelford Williams discovered that the Ceph file system messenger protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate frame segment length in certain situation, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
