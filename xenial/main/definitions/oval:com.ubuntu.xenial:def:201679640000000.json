    "Note": "ebarretto> Setting status as ignored since upstream won't fix it. According to maintainer: The only way I see to properly fix this is to add a whitelist feature where an Admin can define the external hosts and IPs the wiki is allowed to contact. However for not breaking every already installed wiki we would need to keep this list empty (allowing all). TBH I feel like it's not our task to secure other computers. If a wiki server runs within a network that should not be reached from that wiki server, the wiki server should be isolated properly through at least outgoing firewall rules or by a proper DMZ setup."
