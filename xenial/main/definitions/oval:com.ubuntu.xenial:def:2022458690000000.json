		"Title": "CVE-2022-45869 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A race condition in the x86 KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 6.1-rc6 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash or host OS memory corruption) when nested virtualisation and the TDP MMU are enabled. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 KVM subsystem implementation in the Linux kernel when nested virtualization and the TDP MMU are enabled. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash).",
