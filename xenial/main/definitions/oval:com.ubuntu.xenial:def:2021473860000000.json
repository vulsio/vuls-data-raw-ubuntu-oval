		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: hwmon:(w83791d) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structurefield If driver read val value sufficient for (val & 0x08) && (!(val &0x80)) && ((val & 0x7) == ((val >> 4) & 0x7)) from device then Null pointerdereference occurs. (It is possible if tmp = 0b0xyz1xyz, where sameliterals mean same numbers) Also lm75[] does not serve a purpose anymoreafter switching to devm_i2c_new_dummy_device() inw83791d_detect_subclients(). The patch fixes possible NULL pointerdereference by removing lm75[]. Found by Linux Driver Verification project(linuxtesting.org).
