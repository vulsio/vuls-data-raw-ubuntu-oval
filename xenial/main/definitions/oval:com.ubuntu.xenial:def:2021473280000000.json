		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: iscsi: Fix conn use after free during resetsIf we haven't done a unbind target call we can race whereiscsi_conn_teardown wakes up the EH thread and then frees the conn whilethose threads are still accessing the conn ehwait.We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMF fields fromthe conn to the session. We can then rely on theiscsi_session_teardown->iscsi_remove_session->__iscsi_unbind_session callto remove the target and it's devices, and know after that point there isno device or scsi-ml callout trying to access the session.",
