    "Title": "CVE-2019-6111 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-6111` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.8\nopenssh-client-ssh1 - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.8\nopenssh-server - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.8\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.8\nssh - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.8\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.8\nssh-krb5 - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.8\nNo subscription required",

Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using sftp instead of scp.  The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.  The initial USN was incomplete and did not include the second commit."
