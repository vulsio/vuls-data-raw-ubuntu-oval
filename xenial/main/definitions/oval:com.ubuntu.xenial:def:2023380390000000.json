    "Title": "CVE-2023-38039 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so that they can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API. However, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it would accept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless series of headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.",
