		"title": "CVE-2024-25617 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS,FTP, and more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid maybe vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing.This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial ofService when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions ofSquid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size orreply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squidversion 6.5 and later, the default setting of these parameters is safe.Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator issetting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this timeprevent these settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users areadvised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for thisvulnerability. This issue is also tracked as SQUID-2024:2",
