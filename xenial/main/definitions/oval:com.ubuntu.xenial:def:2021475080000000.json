So in btrfs_check_data_free_space() andbtrfs_delalloc_reserve_space() free the allocated extent_changeset to getrid of the allocated memory. The issue currently only happens in the directIO write path, but only after 65b3c08606e5 (\"btrfs: fix ENOSPC failure whenattempting direct IO write into NOCOW range\"), and also atdefrag_one_locked_target(). Every other place is always callingextent_changeset_free() even if its call to btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space()or btrfs_check_data_free_space() has failed.",
