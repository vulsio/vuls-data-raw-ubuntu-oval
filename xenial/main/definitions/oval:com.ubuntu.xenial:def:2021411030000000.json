		"Title": "CVE-2021-41103 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high",
		"Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis onsimplicity, robustness and portability. A bug was found in containerd wherecontainer root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restrictedpermissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traversedirectory contents and execute programs. When containers includedexecutable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid),unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. Whenthe UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the fileowner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the hostcould discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has beenfixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update tothese version when they are released and may restart containers or updatedirectory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to updateshould limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directorypermission on container bundles directories.",
