		"Title": "CVE-2023-39194 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the XFRM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The specific flaw exists within the processing of state filters, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to an information disclosure. Lucas Leong discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle state filters, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
