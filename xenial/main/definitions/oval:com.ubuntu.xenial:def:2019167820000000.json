		"description": "There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack(RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8.Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attackstargeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in adatabase that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of thatsession id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up asession, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack thesession. The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way thesession is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-16782` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-rack - 1.6.4-3ubuntu0.2+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
