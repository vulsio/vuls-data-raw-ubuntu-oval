		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb'sUpon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Onlyieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. In the Tx case we then leakthe skb structure.Free the skb structure upon error before returning when appropriate.As the 'is_tx = 0' cannot be moved in the complete handler because of apossible race between the delay in switching to STATE_RX_AACK_ON and anew interrupt, we introduce an intermediate 'was_tx' boolean just forthis purpose.There is no Fixes tag applying here, many changes have been made on thisarea and the issue kind of always existed.",
