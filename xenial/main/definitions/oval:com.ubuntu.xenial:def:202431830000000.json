		"description": "A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ isencrypted using the client’s session key. This key is different for eachnew session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, theticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly.For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principalrandomly-generated salt and the user’s password. If a principal iscompromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve ticketsencrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own keydirectly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could runbrute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets whencombined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password).",
