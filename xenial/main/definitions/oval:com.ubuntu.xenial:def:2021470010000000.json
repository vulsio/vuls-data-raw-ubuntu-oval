		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xprtrdma: Fix cwnd update orderingAfter a reconnect, the reply handler is opening the cwnd (and thusenabling more RPC Calls to be sent) /before/ rpcrdma_post_recvs()can post enough Receive WRs to receive their replies. This causes anRNR and the new connection is lost immediately.The race is most clearly exposed when KASAN and disconnect injectionare enabled. This slows down rpcrdma_rep_create() enough to allowthe send side to post a bunch of RPC Calls before the Receivecompletion handler can invoke ib_post_recv().",
