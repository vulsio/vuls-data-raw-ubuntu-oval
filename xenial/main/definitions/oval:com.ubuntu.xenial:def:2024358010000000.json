		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD Commit 672365477ae8(\"x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required\") and commit 8bf26758ca96(\"x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate\") introduced a per CPU variablexfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in order to avoidunnecessary writes to the MSR. On CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to theinit_fpstate.xfd, which wipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cachedxfd value is not reset, which brings them out of sync. As a consequence asubsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update the MSR which in turncan result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel space, which crashes thekernel. To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state togetherwith MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.",
