		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/pci: Lock external INTx masking ops Mask operations through configspace changes to DisINTx may race INTx configuration changes via ioctl.Create wrappers that add locking for paths outside of the core interruptcode. In particular, irq_type is updated holding igate, therefore testingis_intx() requires holding igate. For example clearing DisINTx from configspace can otherwise race changes of the interrupt configuration. Thisaligns interfaces which may trigger the INTx eventfd into two camps, oneside serialized by igate and the other only enabled while INTx isconfigured. A subsequent patch introduces synchronization for the latterflows.",
