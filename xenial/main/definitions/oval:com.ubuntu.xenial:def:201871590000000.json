		"title": "CVE-2018-7159 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low",
		"description": "The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the`Content-Length` header, allowing input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to beinterpreted as having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification does notallow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parserhas been brought into line on this particular difference. The security riskof this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it isdifficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of thisflaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrectvalue for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code thatmake incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this valuecompared to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users craftinglower-level HTTP utilities are advised to re-check the length of any inputsupplied after parsing is complete.",
