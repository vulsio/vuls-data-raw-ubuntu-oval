		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char device Since commit fa1f68db6ca7(\"drivers: misc: pass miscdevice pointer via file private data\"), themiscdevice stores a pointer to itself inside filp->private_data, whichmeans that private_data will not be NULL when wmi_char_open() is called.This might cause memory corruption should wmi_char_open() be unable to findits driver, something which can happen when the associated WMI device isdeleted in wmi_free_devices(). Fix the problem by using the miscdevicepointer to retrieve the WMI device data associated with a char device usingcontainer_of(). This also avoids wmi_char_open() picking a wrong WMI devicebound to a driver with the same name as the original driver.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52864` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1004-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nNo subscription required",
