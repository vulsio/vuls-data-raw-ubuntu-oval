		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char device Since commit fa1f68db6ca7(\"drivers: misc: pass miscdevice pointer via file private data\"), themiscdevice stores a pointer to itself inside filp->private_data, whichmeans that private_data will not be NULL when wmi_char_open() is called.This might cause memory corruption should wmi_char_open() be unable to findits driver, something which can happen when the associated WMI device isdeleted in wmi_free_devices(). Fix the problem by using the miscdevicepointer to retrieve the WMI device data associated with a char device usingcontainer_of(). This also avoids wmi_char_open() picking a wrong WMI devicebound to a driver with the same name as the original driver.",
