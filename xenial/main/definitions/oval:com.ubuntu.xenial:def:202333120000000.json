    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in drivers/cpufreq/qcom-cpufreq-hw.c in cpufreq subsystem in the Linux Kernel. This flaw, during device unbind will lead to double release problem leading to denial of service. It was discovered that the QCOM CPUFreq HW driver in the Linux kernel on ARM processors did not properly handle device unbind. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
