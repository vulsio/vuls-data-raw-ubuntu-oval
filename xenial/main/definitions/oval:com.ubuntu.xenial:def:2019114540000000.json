		"Title": "CVE-2019-11454 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in http/cervlet.c in Tildeslash Monit before 5.25.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript via manipulation of an unsanitized user field of the Authorization header for HTTP Basic Authentication, which is mishandled during an _viewlog operation. Zack Flack discovered that Monit incorrectly handled certain input. A remote authenticated user could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
