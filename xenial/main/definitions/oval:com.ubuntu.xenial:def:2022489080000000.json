		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: arcnet: com20020: Fix null-ptr-deref in com20020pci_probe()During driver initialization, the pointer of card info, i.e. thevariable 'ci' is required. However, the definition of'com20020pci_id_table' reveals that this field is empty for somedevices, which will cause null pointer dereference when initializingthese devices.The following log reveals it:[    3.973806] KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range[0x0000000000000028-0x000000000000002f][    3.973819] RIP: 0010:com20020pci_probe+0x18d/0x13e0 [com20020_pci][    3.975181] Call Trace:[    3.976208]  local_pci_probe+0x13f/0x210[    3.977248]  pci_device_probe+0x34c/0x6d0[    3.977255]  ? pci_uevent+0x470/0x470[    3.978265]  really_probe+0x24c/0x8d0[    3.978273]  __driver_probe_device+0x1b3/0x280[    3.979288]  driver_probe_device+0x50/0x370Fix this by checking whether the 'ci' is a null pointer first.",
