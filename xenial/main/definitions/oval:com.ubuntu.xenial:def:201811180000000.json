		"Title": "CVE-2018-1118 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "Linux kernel vhost since version 4.8 does not properly initialize memory in messages passed between virtual guests and the host operating system in the vhost/vhost.c:vhost_new_msg() function. This can allow local privileged users to read some kernel memory contents when reading from the /dev/vhost-net device file. It was discovered that the VirtIO subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1118` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1019-gcp - 4.15.0-1019.20~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-34-generic - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-34-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-34-lowlatency - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-34-generic - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-34-lowlatency - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1019-gcp - 4.15.0-1019.20~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-34-generic - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-34-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-34-lowlatency - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-34-generic - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-34-lowlatency - 4.15.0-34.37~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
