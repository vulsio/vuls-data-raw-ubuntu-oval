		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mISDN:fix possible use-after-free in HFC_cleanup() This module's remove pathcalls del_timer(). However, that function does not wait until the timerhandler finishes. This means that the timer handler may still be runningafter the driver's remove function has finished, which would result in ause-after-free. Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timerhandler has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
