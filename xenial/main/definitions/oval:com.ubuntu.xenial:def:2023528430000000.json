		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:llc: verify mac len before reading mac headerLLC reads the mac header with eth_hdr without verifying that the skbhas an Ethernet header.Syzbot was able to enter llc_rcv on a tun device. Tun can insertpackets without mac len and with user configurable skb->protocol(passing a tun_pi header when not configuring IFF_NO_PI).

All these areprotected by a test skb->protocol == ETH_P_802_2. Which does notprotect against this tun scenario.But the mac_len test added in this patch in llc_fixup_skb willindirectly protect those too. That is called from llc_rcv before anyother LLC code.It is tempting to just add a blanket mac_len check in llc_rcv, butnot sure whether that could break valid LLC paths that do not assumean Ethernet header. 802.2 LLC may be used on top of non-802.3protocols in principle. The below referenced commit shows that usedto, on top of Token Ring.At least one of the three eth_hdr uses goes back to before the startof git history. But the one that syzbot exercises is introduced inthis commit. That commit is old enough (2008), that effectively allstable kernels should receive this.",
