		"Title": "CVE-2016-6581 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK librarybetween v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack,specifically a so-called \"HPACK Bomb\" attack. This attack occurs when anattacker inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACKdynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can thensend a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that fieldin the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of dataon the target machine.",
