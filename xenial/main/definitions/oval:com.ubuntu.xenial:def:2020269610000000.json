    "Title": "CVE-2020-26961 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26961` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 83.0+build2-0ubuntu0.16.04.3\nfirefox-geckodriver - 83.0+build2-0ubuntu0.16.04.3\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 83.0+build2-0ubuntu0.16.04.3\nNo subscription required",
