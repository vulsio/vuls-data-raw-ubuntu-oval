		"description": "Dolibarr is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationshipmanagement (CRM) software package. Version 18.0.4 has a HTML Injectionvulnerability in the Home page of the Dolibarr Application. Thisvulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags andmanipulate the rendered content in the application's response.Specifically, I was able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into thereturned document and, as a result, was able to comment out some part ofthe Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior can be exploited toperform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To remediate theissue, validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially withinHTML attributes, to prevent HTML injection attacks; and implement properoutput encoding when rendering user-provided data to ensure it is treatedas plain text rather than executable HTML.",
