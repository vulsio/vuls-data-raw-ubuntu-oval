		"Title": "CVE-2018-3139 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g. code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). Artem Smotrakov discovered that the HTTP client redirection handler implementation in OpenJDK did not clear potentially sensitive information in HTTP headers when following redirections to different hosts. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-3139` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nopenjdk-8-jre-jamvm - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1\nNo subscription required",

		"Note": "sbeattie> the release notes contain the following with respect to this issue: Better HTTP Redirection Support: In this release, the behavior of methods which application code uses to set request properties in java.net.HttpURLConnection has changed. When a redirect occurs automatically from the original destination server to a resource on a different server, then all such properties are cleared for the redirect and any subsequent redirects. If these properties are required to be set on the redirected requests, then the redirect responses should be handled by the application by calling HttpURLConnection.setInstanceFollowRedirects(false) for the original request."
