		"Description": "A flaw was found in vDPA with VDUSE backend. There are currently no checksin VDUSE kernel driver to ensure the size of the device config space is inline with the features advertised by the VDUSE userspace application. Incase of a mismatch, Virtio drivers config read helpers do not initializethe memory indirectly passed to vduse_vdpa_get_config() returninguninitialized memory from the stack. This could cause undefined behavior ordata leaks in Virtio drivers.",
