The original patches fixing CVE-2023-1076 areincorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits- a096ccca6e50 (\"tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid\"), -66b2c338adce (\"tap: tap_open(): correctly initialize socket uid\"), pass\"inode->i_uid\" to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and that turnsout to not be accurate.",
