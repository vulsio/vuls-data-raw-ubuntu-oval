    "Title": "CVE-2022-26966 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12. drivers/net/usb/sr9700.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from heap memory via crafted frame lengths from a device. It was discovered that the USB SR9700 ethernet device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate the length of requests from the device. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
