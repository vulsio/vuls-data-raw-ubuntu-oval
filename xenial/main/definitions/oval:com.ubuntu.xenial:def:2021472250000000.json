		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handlingSyzbot reports that when you have AP_VLAN interfaces that are upand close the AP interface they belong to, we get a deadlock. Nosurprise - since we dev_close() them with the wiphy mutex held,which goes back into the netdev notifier in cfg80211 and tries toacquire the wiphy mutex there.To fix this, we need to do two things: 1) prevent changing iftype while AP_VLANs are up, we can't    easily fix this case since cfg80211 already calls us with    the wiphy mutex held, but change_interface() is relatively    rare in drivers anyway, so changing iftype isn't used much    (and userspace has to fall back to down/change/up anyway) 2) pull the dev_close() loop over VLANs out of the wiphy mutex    section in the normal stop case",
