		"Title": "CVE-2021-39226 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high",
		"Description": "Grafana is an open source data visualization platform. In affected versionsunauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot withthe lowest database key by accessing the literal paths:/dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key. If the snapshot\"public_mode\" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of false),unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowestdatabase key by accessing the literal path:/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Regardless of the snapshot \"public_mode\"setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with thelowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The combination of deletion and viewingenables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting incomplete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6and 7.5.11. If for some reason you cannot upgrade you can use a reverseproxy or similar to block access to the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key,/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, /dashboard/snapshot/:key, and/api/snapshots/:key. They have no normal function and can be disabledwithout side effects.",
