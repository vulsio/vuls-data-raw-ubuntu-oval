		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma-buf/sync_file: Don't leak fences on merge failureEach add_fence() call does a dma_fence_get() on the relevant fence.  Inthe error path, we weren't calling dma_fence_put() so all those fencesgot leaked.  Also, in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren'tfreeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure that i and fences are alwayszero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences) onevery error path.",
