While not exposed to the affectedguests themselves, the interface specifically exists for domainscontrolling such guests. This interface may therefore be used by not fullyprivileged entities, e.g. qemu running deprivileged in Dom0 or qemu runningin a so called stub-domain. With this exposure it is an issue that - thenumber of the such controlled regions was unbounded (CVE-2022-42333), -installation and removal of such regions was not properly serialized(CVE-2022-42334).",
