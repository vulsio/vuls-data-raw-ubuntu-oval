    "Title": "CVE-2018-5953 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - negligible.",
    "Description": "The swiotlb_print_info function in lib/swiotlb.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.14 allows local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading dmesg data from a \"software IO TLB\" printk call. It was discovered that the software IO TLB implementation in the Linux kernel could report kernel pointers via dmesg. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-5953` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1030-aws - 4.15.0-1030.31~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-azure - 4.15.0-1013.13~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1014-gcp - 4.15.0-1014.14~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1030-aws - 4.15.0-1030.31~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-azure - 4.15.0-1013.13~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1014-gcp - 4.15.0-1014.14~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-generic - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-24-lowlatency - 4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
