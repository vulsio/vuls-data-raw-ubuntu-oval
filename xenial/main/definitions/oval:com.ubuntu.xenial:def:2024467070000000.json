		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: arm64: Make ICC_*SGI*_EL1 undef in the absence of a vGICv3On a system with a GICv3, if a guest hasn't been configured withGICv3 and that the host is not capable of GICv2 emulation,a write to any of the ICC_*SGI*_EL1 registers is trapped to EL2.We therefore try to emulate the SGI access, only to hit a NULLpointer as no private interrupt is allocated (no GIC, remember?).The obvious fix is to give the guest what it deserves, in theshape of a UNDEF exception.",
