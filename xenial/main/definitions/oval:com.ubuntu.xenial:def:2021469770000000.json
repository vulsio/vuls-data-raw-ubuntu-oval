		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:VMX: Disable preemption when probing user return MSRs Disable preemptionwhen probing a user return MSR via RDSMR/WRMSR. If the MSR holds adifferent value per logical CPU, the WRMSR could corrupt the host's valueif KVM is preempted between the RDMSR and WRMSR, and then rescheduled on adifferent CPU. Opportunistically land the helper in common x86, SVM willuse the helper in a future commit.",
