		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing A race conditionexists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the online process tofail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent state. As a result,subsequent attempts to set that device online fail with return code ENODEV.The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after a waitfor final device state completed, but before the result state is evaluated.Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between determiningfinal state and checking result state. Note that since: commit 2297791c92d0(\"s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers\") pathverification requests are much more likely to occur during boot, resultingin an increased chance of this race condition occurring.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27009` to fix the vulnerability.
