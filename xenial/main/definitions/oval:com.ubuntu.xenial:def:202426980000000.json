		"description": "A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation ofMS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the\"forwardable\" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required addinga special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the targetservice argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for generalconstrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to matchthe changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resultingin this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is setAND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being acceptedregardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.",
