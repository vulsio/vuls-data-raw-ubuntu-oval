    "Description": "In lg_probe and related functions of hid-lg.c and other USB HID files, there is a possible out of bounds read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local information disclosure if a malicious USB HID device were plugged in, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-188677105References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the HID subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inputs in certain conditions. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to expose sensitive information.",
