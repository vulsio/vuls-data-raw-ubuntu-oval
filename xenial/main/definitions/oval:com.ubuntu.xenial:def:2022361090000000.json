		"description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable softwarecontainerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) wheresupplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has directaccess to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access,they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary grouprestrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitiveinformation or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. Thisbug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should bestopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable toupgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER$USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\",\"-\", \"user\"]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.",
