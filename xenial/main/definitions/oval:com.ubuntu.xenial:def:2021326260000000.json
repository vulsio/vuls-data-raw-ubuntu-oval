		"description": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Inaffected versions specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis cancause the heap-based Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete checksfor this condition. This can result with heap corruption and potentiallyremote code execution. This problem exists in all versions of Redis withLua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is fixed in versions6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update an additionalworkaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-serverexecutable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be doneusing ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.",
