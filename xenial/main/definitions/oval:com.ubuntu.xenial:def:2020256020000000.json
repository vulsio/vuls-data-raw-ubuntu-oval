		"title": "CVE-2020-25602 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. An x86 PV guest can triggera host OS crash when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. When a guestaccesses certain Model Specific Registers, Xen first reads the value fromhardware to use as the basis for auditing the guest access. For theMISC_ENABLE MSR, which is an Intel specific MSR, this MSR read is performedwithout error handling for a #GP fault, which is the consequence of tryingto read this MSR on non-Intel hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guestadministrator can crash Xen, resulting in a host Denial of Service. Onlyx86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only Xenversions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are notvulnerable. Only x86 systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR(0x1a0) are vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR andare vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable.Other manufacturers have not been checked. Only x86 PV guests can exploitthe vulnerability. x86 HVM/PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.",
