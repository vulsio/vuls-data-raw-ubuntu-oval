		"description": "ntfs3 in the Linux kernel through 6.8.0 allows a physically proximateattacker to read kernel memory by mounting a filesystem (e.g., if a Linuxdistribution is configured to allow unprivileged mounts of removable media)and then leveraging local access to trigger an out-of-bounds read. A lengthvalue can be larger than the amount of memory allocated. NOTE: thesupplier's perspective is that there is no vulnerability when an attackrequires an attacker-modified filesystem image.",
