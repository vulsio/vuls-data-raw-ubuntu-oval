		"title": "CVE-2023-1998 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "The Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations bycalling prctl with PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculationfeature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed that on VMs of at leastone major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposedto attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigationwith prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine whenforcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line. This happened becausewhen plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logicthat determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protectsagainst cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS,the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performancereasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threadsvulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBPprotects.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1998` to fix the vulnerability.
