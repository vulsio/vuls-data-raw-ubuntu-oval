		"Title": "CVE-2023-0045 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "The current implementation of the prctl syscall does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall. The ib_prctl_set function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall. The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. We recommend upgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96 José Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
