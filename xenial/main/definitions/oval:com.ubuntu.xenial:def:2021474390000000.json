		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_workWhen the ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crasheswith null pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_removefunction tries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue usingcancel_delayed_work_sync routine and unregister switch from dsa.During dsa_unregister_switch it calls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turnreschedules the workqueue since mib_interval is non-zero.Due to which queue executed after mib_interval and it tries to accessdp->slave. But the slave is unregistered in the ksz_switch_removefunction. Hence kernel crashes.To avoid this crash, before canceling the workqueue, resetted themib_interval to 0.v1 -> v2:-Removed the if condition in ksz_mib_read_work",
