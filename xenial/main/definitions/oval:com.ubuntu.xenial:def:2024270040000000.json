This thread holds the clkprepare_lock, and is trying to runtime PM resume a device, when it findsthat the device is in the process of resuming so the thread schedule()saway waiting for the device to finish resuming before continuing. Thesecond thread is runtime PM resuming the same device, but the runtimeresume callback is calling clk_prepare(), trying to grab the prepare_lockwaiting on the first thread. This is a classic ABBA deadlock. To properlyfix the deadlock, we must never runtime PM resume or suspend a device withthe clk prepare_lock held. Actually doing that is near impossible todaybecause the global prepare_lock would have to be dropped in the middle ofthe tree, the device runtime PM resumed/suspended, and then theprepare_lock grabbed again to ensure consistency of the clk tree topology.If anything changes with the clk tree in the meantime, we've lost and willneed to start the operation all over again. Luckily, most of the time we'resimply incrementing or decrementing the runtime PM count on an activedevice, so we don't have the chance to schedule away with the prepare_lockheld.
