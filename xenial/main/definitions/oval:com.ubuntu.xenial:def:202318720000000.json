		"Title": "CVE-2023-1872 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring system can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The io_file_get_fixed function lacks the presence of ctx->uring_lock which can lead to a Use-After-Free vulnerability due a race condition with fixed files getting unregistered. We recommend upgrading past commit da24142b1ef9fd5d36b76e36bab328a5b27523e8. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
