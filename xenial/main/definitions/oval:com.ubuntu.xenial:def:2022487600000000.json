		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:core: Fix hang in usb_kill_urb by adding memory barriers The syzbot fuzzerhas identified a bug in which processes hang waiting for usb_kill_urb() toreturn. It turns out the issue is not unlinking the URB; that works justfine. Rather, the problem arises when the wakeup notification that the URBhas completed is not received. The reason is memory-access ordering on SMPsystems. In outline form, usb_kill_urb() and __usb_hcd_giveback_urb()operating concurrently on different CPUs perform the following actions: CPU0 CPU 1 ---------------------------- ---------------------------------usb_kill_urb(): __usb_hcd_giveback_urb(): ... ... atomic_inc(&urb->reject);atomic_dec(&urb->use_count); ... ... wait_event(usb_kill_urb_queue,atomic_read(&urb->use_count) == 0); if (atomic_read(&urb->reject))wake_up(&usb_kill_urb_queue); Confining your attention to urb->reject andurb->use_count, you can see that the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 0is: write urb->reject, then read urb->use_count; whereas the overallpattern of accesses on CPU 1 is: write urb->use_count, then readurb->reject. This pattern is referred to in memory-model circles as SB (for\"Store Buffering\"), and it is well known that without suitable enforcementof the desired order of accesses -- in the form of memory barriers -- it isentirely possible for one or both CPUs to execute their reads ahead oftheir writes. The end result will be that sometimes CPU 0 sees the oldun-decremented value of urb->use_count while CPU 1 sees the oldun-incremented value of urb->reject. Consequently CPU 0 ends up on the waitqueue and never gets woken up, leading to the observed hang inusb_kill_urb(). The same pattern of accesses occurs in usb_poison_urb() andthe failure pathway of usb_hcd_submit_urb(). The problem is fixed by addingsuitable memory barriers. To provide proper memory-access ordering in theSB pattern, a full barrier is required on both CPUs. The atomic_inc() andatomic_dec() accesses themselves don't provide any memory ordering, butsince they are present, we can use the optimized smp_mb__after_atomic()memory barrier in the various routines to obtain the desired effect. Thispatch adds the necessary memory barriers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48760` to fix the vulnerability.
