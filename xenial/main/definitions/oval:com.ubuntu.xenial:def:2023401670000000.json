		"description": "Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Prior to versions9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1, Jetty accepts the `+` characterproceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is morepermissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject suchrequests with 400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it isconceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used incombination with a server that does not close the connection after sendingsuch a 400 response. Versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1 containa patch for this issue. There is no workaround as there is no known exploitscenario.",
