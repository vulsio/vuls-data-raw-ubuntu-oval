		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tee: amdtee: fix use-after-free vulnerability in amdtee_close_sessionThere is a potential race condition in amdtee_close_session that maycause use-after-free in amdtee_open_session. For instance, if a sessionhas refcount == 1, and one thread tries to free this session via:    kref_put(&sess->refcount, destroy_session);the reference count will get decremented, and the next step would be tocall destroy_session(). However, if in another thread,amdtee_open_session() is called before destroy_session() has completedexecution, alloc_session() may return 'sess' that will be freed uplater in destroy_session() leading to use-after-free inamdtee_open_session.To fix this issue, treat decrement of sess->refcount and removal of'sess' from session list in destroy_session() as a critical section, sothat it is executed atomically.",
