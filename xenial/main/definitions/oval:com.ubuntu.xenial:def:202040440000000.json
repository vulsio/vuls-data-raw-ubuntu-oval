		"Description": "The xrdp-sesman service before version 0.9.13.1 can be crashed byconnecting over port 3350 and supplying a malicious payload. Once thexrdp-sesman process is dead, an unprivileged attacker on the server couldthen proceed to start their own imposter sesman service listening on port3350. This will allow them to capture any user credentials that aresubmitted to XRDP and approve or reject arbitrary login credentials. Forxorgxrdp sessions in particular, this allows an unauthorized user to hijackan existing session. This is a buffer overflow attack, so there may be arisk of arbitrary code execution as well.",
