		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure On TDX it is possiblefor the untrusted host to cause set_memory_encrypted() orset_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned and theresulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care to handle theseerrors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator,which could lead to functional or security issues. DMA could freedecrypted/shared pages if dma_set_decrypted() fails. This should be a rarecase. Just leak the pages in this case instead of freeing them.",
