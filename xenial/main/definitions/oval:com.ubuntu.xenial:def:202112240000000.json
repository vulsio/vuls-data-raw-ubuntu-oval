		"description": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability with TCP Fast Open(TFO) when used in conjunction with the Snort detection engine that couldallow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured filepolicy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of theHTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFOconnection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability bysending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affecteddevice. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configuredfile policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.",
