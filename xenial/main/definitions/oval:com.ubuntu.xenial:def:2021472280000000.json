		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/ioremap: Map EFI-reserved memory as encrypted for SEV Some driversrequire memory that is marked as EFI boot services data. In order for thismemory to not be re-used by the kernel after ExitBootServices(),efi_mem_reserve() is used to preserve it by inserting a new EFI memorydescriptor and marking it with the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute. Under SEV,memory marked with the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute needs to be mappedencrypted by Linux, otherwise the kernel might crash at boot like below:EFI Variables Facility v0.08 2004-May-17 general protection fault, probablyfor non-canonical address 0x3597688770a868b2: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI CPU: 13PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 5.12.4-2-default #1 openSUSE TumbleweedHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015RIP: 0010:efi_mokvar_entry_next [...] Call Trace: efi_mokvar_sysfs_init ?efi_mokvar_table_init do_one_initcall ? __kmalloc kernel_init_freeable ?rest_init kernel_init ret_from_fork Expand the __ioremap_check_other()function to additionally check for this other type of boot data reserved atruntime and indicate that it should be mapped encrypted for an SEV guest.
