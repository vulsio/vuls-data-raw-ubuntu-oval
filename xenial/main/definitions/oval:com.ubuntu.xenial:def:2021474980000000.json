		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dm rq:don't queue request to blk-mq during DM suspend DM uses blk-mq'squiesce/unquiesce to stop/start device mapper queue. But blk-mq's unquiescemay come from outside events, such as elevator switch, updating nr_requestsor others, and request may come during suspend, so simply ask for blk-mq torequeue it. Fixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requestsand dm-mpath suspend/resume stress test.",
