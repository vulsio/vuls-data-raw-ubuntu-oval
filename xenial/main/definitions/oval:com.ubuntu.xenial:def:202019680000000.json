		"title": "CVE-2020-1968 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low",
		"description": "The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can leadto an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connectionswhich have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a casethis would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encryptedcommunications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only beexploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLSconnections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDHciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support andno longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to thisissue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-1968` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.17\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.17\nNo subscription required",
