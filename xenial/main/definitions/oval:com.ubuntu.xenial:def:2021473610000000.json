		"title": "CVE-2021-47361 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mcb:fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus() There are two bugs: 1) Ifida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier) but wehaven't yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that leads to a useafter free. 2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device()to release the bus. This will free the internal resources tied to thedevice and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47361` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
