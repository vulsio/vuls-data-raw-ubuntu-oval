    "Title": "CVE-2018-12551 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in the password file will be treated as valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are unaffected. Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-12551` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmosquitto1 - 1.4.8-1ubuntu0.16.04.5\nlibmosquittopp1 - 1.4.8-1ubuntu0.16.04.5\nmosquitto - 1.4.8-1ubuntu0.16.04.5\nmosquitto-clients - 1.4.8-1ubuntu0.16.04.5\nNo subscription required",
