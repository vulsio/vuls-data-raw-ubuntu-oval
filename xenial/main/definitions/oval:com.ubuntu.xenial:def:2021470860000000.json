		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phonet/pep: refuse to enable an unbound pipe This ioctl() implicitlyassumed that the socket was already bound to a valid local socket name,i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not bound, two separate problemswould occur: 1) We'd send an pipe enablement request with an invalid sourceobject. 2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket unexpectedly beingconnected yet not bound to a valid object.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47086` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-aws - 4.15.0-1120.128~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-gcp - 4.15.0-1116.130~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-oracle - 4.15.0-1087.95~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
