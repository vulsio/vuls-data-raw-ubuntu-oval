		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() Syzbot reported a hang issuein migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind() andnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2. Whilemigrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback tocomplete, the log writer thread that should bring the writeback tocompletion picks up the folio being written back innilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log creationand was trying to lock the folio. Thus causing a deadlock. In the firstplace, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of writeback willbe updated and become dirty. Nilfs2 adds a checksum to verify the validityof the log being written and uses it for recovery at mount, so data changesduring writeback are suppressed. Since this is broken, an unclean shutdowncould potentially cause recovery to fail. Investigation revealed that theroot cause is that the wait for writeback completion innilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing device does notrequire stable writes, data may be modified without waiting. Fix theseissues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to finishregardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device.",
