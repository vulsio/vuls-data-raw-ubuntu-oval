		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list Asession can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface \"remove_path\" thateventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function. The currentrtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs interfaces andfrees sess->stats object. Second it removes the session from the activelist. Therefore some functions could access non-connected session andaccess the freed sess->stats object even-if they check the session statusbefore accessing the session. For instance rtrs_clt_request andget_next_path_min_inflight check the session status and try to send IO tothe session. The session status could be changed when they are trying tosend IO but they could not catch the change and update the statisticsinformation in sess->stats object, and generate use-after-free problem.(see: \"RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading itsstats\") This patch changes the rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to removethe session from the active session list and then destroy the sysfsinterfaces. Each function still should check the session status becauseclosing or error recovery paths can change the status.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47026` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.8.0-39.42~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.8.0-39.42~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.8.0-39.42~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1030.31~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-azure - 4.11.0-1009.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.10.0-1004.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
