		"title": "CVE-2018-1000200 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointerdereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of largemlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's finalthread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlockedvmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range()since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine ifany other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1000200` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nNo subscription required",
