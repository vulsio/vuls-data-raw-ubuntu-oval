		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:mxl111sf: change mutex_init() location Syzbot reported, thatmxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitialized mutex. The problem was in wrongmutex_init() location. Previous mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in->init() function, but dvb_usbv2_init() has this order of calls:dvb_usbv2_init() dvb_usbv2_adapter_init() dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_init()props->frontend_attach() props->init() Since mxl111sf_* devices callmxl111sf_ctrl_msg() in ->frontend_attach() internally we need to initializestate->msg_lock before frontend_attach(). To achieve it, ->probe() calladded to all mxl111sf_* devices, which will simply initiaize mutex.",
