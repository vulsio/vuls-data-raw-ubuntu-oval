		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fpga: bridge: add owner module and take its refcountThe current implementation of the fpga bridge assumes that the low-levelmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointerto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it canlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the bridge ifthe parent device does not have a driver.To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_bridgestruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the function forregistering a bridge to take an additional owner module parameter andrename it to avoid conflicts. Use the old function name for a helper macrothat automatically sets the module that registers the bridge as the owner.This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules andreduces the chances of registering a bridge without setting the owner.Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interfacefor registering an fpga bridge.Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_bridge_get()to fpga_bridge_get() and of_fpga_bridge_get() to improve code clarity sincethe bridge device is taken in these functions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36479` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
