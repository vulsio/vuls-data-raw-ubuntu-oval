		"Title": "CVE-2023-1075 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tls_is_tx_ready() incorrectly checks for list emptiness, potentially accessing a type confused entry to the list_head, leaking the last byte of the confused field that overlaps with rec->tx_ready. It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
