		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:userfaultfd: don't BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page tableSince khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in filemappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are wrong - getrid of them.We could also remove the preceding \"if (unlikely(...))\" block, but then wecould reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for filemappings but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be finebut I think is not necessarily expected.",
