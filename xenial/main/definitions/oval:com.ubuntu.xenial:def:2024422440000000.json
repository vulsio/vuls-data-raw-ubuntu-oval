		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:USB: serial: mos7840: fix crash on resumeSince commit c49cfa917025 (\"USB: serial: use generic method if noalternative is provided in usb serial layer\"), USB serial core calls thegeneric resume implementation when the driver has not provided one.This can trigger a crash on resume with mos7840 since support formultiple read URBs was added back in 2011. Specifically, both port readURBs are now submitted on resume for open ports, but the context pointerof the second URB is left set to the core rather than mos7840 portstructure.Fix this by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions formos7840.Tested with Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter.[ johan: analyse crash and rewrite commit message; set busy flag on         resume; drop bulk-in check; drop unnecessary usb_kill_urb() ]",
