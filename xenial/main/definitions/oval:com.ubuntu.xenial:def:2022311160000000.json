		"description": "UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C withbindings for Python 3.7+. Affected versions were found to improperly decodecertain characters. JSON strings that contain escaped surrogate charactersnot part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded incorrectly. Besidescorrupting strings, this allowed for potential key confusion and valueoverwriting in dictionaries. All users parsing JSON from untrusted sourcesare vulnerable. From version 5.4.0, UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates inthe same way as the standard library's `json` module does, preserving themin the parsed output. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no knownworkarounds for this issue.",
