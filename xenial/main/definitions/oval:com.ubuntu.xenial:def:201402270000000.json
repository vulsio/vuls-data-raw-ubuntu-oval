    "Title": "CVE-2014-0227 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "java/org/apache/coyote/http11/filters/ChunkedInputFilter.java in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.42, 7.x before 7.0.55, and 8.x before 8.0.9 does not properly handle attempts to continue reading data after an error has occurred, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by streaming data with malformed chunked transfer coding. It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled data with malformed chunked transfer coding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks, or cause Tomcat to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-0227` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibservlet2.5-java - 6.0.45+dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
