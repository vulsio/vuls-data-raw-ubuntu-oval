		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial: max3100: Update uart_driver_registered on driver removalThe removal of the last MAX3100 device triggers the removal ofthe driver. However, code doesn't update the respective globalvariable and after insmod — rmmod — insmod cycle the kerneloopses:  max3100 spi-PRP0001:01: max3100_probe: adding port 0  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000408  ...  RIP: 0010:serial_core_register_port+0xa0/0x840  ...   max3100_probe+0x1b6/0x280 [max3100]   spi_probe+0x8d/0xb0Update the actual state so next time UART driver will be registeredagain.Hugo also noticed, that the error path in the probe also affectedby having the variable set, and not cleared. Instead of clearing itmove the assignment after the successfull uart_register_driver() call.",
