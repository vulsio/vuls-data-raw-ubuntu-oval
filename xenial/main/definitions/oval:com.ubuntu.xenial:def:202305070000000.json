		"description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.Starting with the 8.1 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerabilityaffecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possibledue to map attributions weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitraryJavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized userof the Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in orderto change a panel to include a map attribution containing JavaScript. Thismeans that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user withEditor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role ifthe user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.",
