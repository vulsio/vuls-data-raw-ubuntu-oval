    "Title": "CVE-2023-0458 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A speculative pointer dereference problem exists in the Linux Kernel on the do_prlimit() function. The resource argument value is controlled and is used in pointer arithmetic for the 'rlim' variable and can be used to leak the contents. We recommend upgrading past version 6.1.8 or commit 739790605705ddcf18f21782b9c99ad7d53a8c11 Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that syscalls invoking the do_prlimit() function in the Linux kernel did not properly handle speculative execution barriers. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
