		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpointsAs part of commit e81a7018d93a (\"usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structuredynamically\") the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will freethe dwc->gadget structure upon the device's removal whenusb_del_gadget_udc() is called in dwc3_gadget_exit().However, simply freeing the gadget results a dangling pointersituation: the endpoints created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints()have their dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_headanchored at dwc->gadget->ep_list.  Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,the first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer andlikewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.The dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in ause-after-free when it calls list_del().This was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.The recent commit 568262bf5492 (\"usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdowncallback for dwc3\") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.There are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to performa list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it fromthe rest of the dwc3_ep chain.Another approach is what this patch does, by splitting up theusb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate \"del\" and \"put\"components.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to becalled before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget().",
