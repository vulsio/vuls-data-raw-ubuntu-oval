		"title": "CVE-2024-43881 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packetsFor fragmented packets, ath12k reassembles each fragment as a normalpacket and then reinjects it into HW ring. In this case, the DMAdirection should be DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE. Otherwise,an invalid payload may be reinjected into the HW andsubsequently delivered to the host.Given that arbitrary memory can be allocated to the skb buffer,knowledge about the data contained in the reinjected buffer is lacking.Consequently, there’s a risk of private information being leaked.Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.1.1-00209-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43881` to fix the vulnerability.
