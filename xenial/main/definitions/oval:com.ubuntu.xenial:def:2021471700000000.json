		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:usbfs: Don't WARN about excessively large memory allocations Syzbot foundthat the kernel generates a WARNing if the user tries to submit a bulktransfer through usbfs with a buffer that is way too large. This isn't abug in the kernel; it's merely an invalid request from the user and theusbfs code does handle it correctly. In theory the same thing can happenwith async transfers, or with the packet descriptor table for isochronoustransfers. To prevent the MM subsystem from complaining about these badallocation requests, add the __GFP_NOWARN flag to the kmalloc calls forthese buffers.",
