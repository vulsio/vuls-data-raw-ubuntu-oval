    "Title": "CVE-2021-33909 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05. It was discovered that the virtual file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained an unsigned to signed integer conversion error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
