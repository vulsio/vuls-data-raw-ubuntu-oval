		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: core: remove unnecessary WARN_ON() in implement()Syzkaller hit a warning [1] in a call to implement() when tryingto write a value into a field of smaller size in an output report.Since implement() already has a warn message printed out with thehelp of hid_warn() and value in question gets trimmed with:\t...\tvalue &= m;\t...WARN_ON may be considered superfluous. Remove it to suppress futuresyzkaller triggers.[1]WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5084 at drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451 implementdrivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451 [inline]WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5084 at drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451hid_output_report+0x548/0x760 drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1863Modules linked in:CPU: 0 PID: 5084 Comm: syz-executor424 Not tainted6.9.0-rc7-syzkaller-00183-gcf87f46fd34d #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 04/02/2024RIP: 0010:implement drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451 [inline]RIP: 0010:hid_output_report+0x548/0x760 drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1863...Call Trace: <TASK> __usbhid_submit_report drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c:591 [inline] usbhid_submit_report+0x43d/0x9e0 drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c:636 hiddev_ioctl+0x138b/0x1f00 drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c:726 vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline] __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:904 [inline] __se_sys_ioctl+0xfc/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:890 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xf5/0x240 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f...\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39509` to fix the vulnerability.
