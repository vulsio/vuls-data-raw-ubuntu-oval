		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ reqAdding the following warning ...  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.add_addr_accepted == 0)... before decrementing the add_addr_accepted counter helped to find abug when running the \"remove single subflow\" subtest from themptcp_join.sh selftest.Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then thesubflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of theRM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement thisadd_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows havenot been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attachedsubflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated bythe host receiving the RM_ADDR.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45009` to fix the vulnerability.
