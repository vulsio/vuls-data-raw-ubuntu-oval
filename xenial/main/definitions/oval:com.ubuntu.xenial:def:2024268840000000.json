		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches The hashtab code relies onroundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of hash buckets, and contains anoverflow check by checking if the resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bitarches, the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shiftof an unsigned long value, which is undefined behaviour, so it is notguaranteed to truncate neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on theDEVMAP_HASH type, which contains the same check, copied from the hashtabcode. So apply the same fix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check tobefore the roundup.",
