		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: aoe:avoid potential deadlock at set_capacity Move set_capacity() outside of thesection procected by (&d->lock). To avoid possible interrupt unsafe lockingscenario: CPU0 CPU1 ---- ---- [1] lock(&bdev->bd_size_lock);local_irq_disable(); [2] lock(&d->lock); [3] lock(&bdev->bd_size_lock);<Interrupt> [4] lock(&d->lock); *** DEADLOCK *** Where[1](&bdev->bd_size_lock) hold by zram_add()->set_capacity().[2]lock(&d->lock) hold by aoeblk_gdalloc(). And aoeblk_gdalloc() is tryingto acquire [3](&bdev->bd_size_lock) at set_capacity() call. In thissituation an attempt to acquire [4]lock(&d->lock) from aoecmd_cfg_rsp()will lead to deadlock. So the simplest solution is breaking lock dependency[2](&d->lock) -> [3](&bdev->bd_size_lock) by moving set_capacity() outside.",
