		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: atm:iphase: fix possible use-after-free in ia_module_exit() This module'sremove path calls del_timer(). However, that function does not wait untilthe timer handler finishes. This means that the timer handler may still berunning after the driver's remove function has finished, which would resultin a use-after-free. Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure thetimer handler has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
