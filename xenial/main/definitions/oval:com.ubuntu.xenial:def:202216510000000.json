		"Title": "CVE-2022-1651 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in acrn_dev_ioctl in the drivers/virt/acrn/hsm.c function in how the ACRN Device Model emulates virtual NICs in VM. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to leak unauthorized kernel information, causing a denial of service. It was discovered that the ACRN Hypervisor Service Module implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
