		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:kprobes: Fix possible use-after-free issue on kprobe registration Whenunloading a module, its state is changing MODULE_STATE_LIVE ->MODULE_STATE_GOING -> MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. Each change will take a time.`is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()` works withMODULE_STATE_LIVE and MODULE_STATE_GOING. If we use`is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()` separately, thereis a chance that the first one is succeeded but the next one is failedbecause module->state becomes MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED between thoseoperations. In `check_kprobe_address_safe()`, if the second`__module_text_address()` is failed, that is ignored because it expected akernel_text address. But it may have failed simply because module->statehas been changed to MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. In this case, arm_kprobe() willtry to modify non-exist module text address (use-after-free). To fix thisproblem, we should not use separated `is_module_text_address()` and`__module_text_address()`, but use only `__module_text_address()` once anddo `try_module_get(module)` which is only available with MODULE_STATE_LIVE.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35955` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
