		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sysv: don't call sb_bread() with pointers_lock heldsyzbot is reporting sleep in atomic context in SysV filesystem [1], forsb_bread() is called with rw_spinlock held.A \"write_lock(&pointers_lock) => read_lock(&pointers_lock) deadlock\" bugand a \"sb_bread() with write_lock(&pointers_lock)\" bug were introduced by\"Replace BKL for chain locking with sysvfs-private rwlock\" in Linux 2.5.12.Then, \"[PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix\" in Linux 2.6.8 fixed theformer bug by moving pointers_lock lock to the callers, but insteadintroduced a \"sb_bread() with read_lock(&pointers_lock)\" bug (which madethis problem easier to hit).Al Viro suggested that why not to do like get_branch()/get_block()/find_shared() in Minix filesystem does. And doing like that is almost arevert of \"[PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix\" except that get_branch() from with find_shared() is called without write_lock(&pointers_lock).",
