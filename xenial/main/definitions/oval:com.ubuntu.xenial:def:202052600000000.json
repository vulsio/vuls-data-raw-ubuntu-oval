		"description": "Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be trickedinto sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Gituses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwordsor other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system.Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can injectunintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing thecredential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g.,good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g.,evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent tothe latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two,meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present storedcredentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability canbe triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affectedURLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systemswhich automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Gitsubmodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has beenpatched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back tov2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so byapplying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for gitfsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against thevulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3,2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-5260` to fix the vulnerability.
