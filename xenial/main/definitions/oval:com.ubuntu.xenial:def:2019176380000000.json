		"description": "In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.4.27.v20200227 to 9.4.29.v20200521, in case oftoo large response headers, Jetty throws an exception to produce an HTTP431 error. When this happens, the ByteBuffer containing the HTTP responseheaders is released back to the ByteBufferPool twice. Because of thisdouble release, two threads can acquire the same ByteBuffer from the pooland while thread1 is about to use the ByteBuffer to write response1 data,thread2 fills the ByteBuffer with other data. Thread1 then proceeds towrite the buffer that now contains different data. This results in client1,which issued request1 seeing data from another request or response whichcould contain sensitive data belonging to client2 (HTTP session ids,authentication credentials, etc.). If the Jetty version cannot be upgraded,the vulnerability can be significantly reduced by configuring aresponseHeaderSize significantly larger than the requestHeaderSize (12KBresponseHeaderSize and 8KB requestHeaderSize).",
