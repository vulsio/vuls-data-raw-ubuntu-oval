    "Title": "CVE-2022-1012 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A memory leak problem was found in the TCP source port generation algorithm in net/ipv4/tcp.c due to the small table perturb size. This flaw may allow an attacker to information leak and may cause a denial of service problem. Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
