		"Title": "CVE-2013-2035 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "Race condition in hawtjni-runtime/src/main/java/org/fusesource/hawtjni/runtime/Library.java in HawtJNI before 1.8, when a custom library path is not specified, allows local users to execute arbitrary Java code by overwriting a temporary JAR file with a predictable name in /tmp. It was discovered that HawtJNI wrote files with predictable names to /tmp. A local attacker could exploit a race condition by overwriting the predictably named temporary files, resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2013-2035` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibhawtjni-runtime-java - 1.10-1\nNo subscription required",
