		"Title": "CVE-2015-8869 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "OCaml before 4.03.0 does not properly handle sign extensions, which allows remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks or obtain sensitive information as demonstrated by a long string to the String.copy function. It was discovered that OCaml mishandled sign extensions. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to steal sensitive information, cause a denial of service (crash), or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
