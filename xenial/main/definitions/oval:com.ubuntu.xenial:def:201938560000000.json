		"Description": "An integer overflow flaw, which could lead to an out of bounds write, was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way keyboard prompt requests are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server. It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled prompt requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
