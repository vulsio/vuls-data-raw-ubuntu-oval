		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iio:mma8452: Fix trigger reference couting The mma8452 driver directly assignsa trigger to the struct iio_dev. The IIO core when done using this triggerwill call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop the reference count by 1. Without thematching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference count can reach 0too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a use-after-freeoccurs. Fix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning itto the IIO device.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47500` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-aws - 4.15.0-1120.128~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-gcp - 4.15.0-1116.130~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-oracle - 4.15.0-1087.95~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
