		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fpga: manager: add owner module and take its refcountThe current implementation of the fpga manager assumes that the low-levelmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointerto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it canlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the manager ifthe parent device does not have a driver.To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_managerstruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions forregistering the manager to take an additional owner module parameter andrename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helpermacros that automatically set the module that registers the manager as theowner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modulesand reduces the chances of registering a manager without setting the owner.Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interfacefor registering an fpga manager.Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_mgr_get() tofpga_mgr_get() and of_fpga_mgr_get() to improve code clarity since themanager device is taken in these functions.",
