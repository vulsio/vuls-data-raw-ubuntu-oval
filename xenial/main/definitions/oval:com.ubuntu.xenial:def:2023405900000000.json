		"description": " GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. Whenresolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working directory,and after that the PATH environment. GitPython defaults to use the `git`command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a `git.exe` or `git`executable, that program will be run instead of the one in the user's`PATH`. This is more of a problem on how Python interacts with Windowssystems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected by this. But probablypeople using GitPython usually run it from the CWD of a repo. An attackercan trick a user to download a repository with a malicious `git`executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython from that directory, itallows the attacker to run any arbitrary commands. There is no fixcurrently available for windows users, however there are a few mitigations.1: Default to an absolute path for the git program on Windows, like`C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\cmd\\\\git.EXE` (default git path installation). 2:Require users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variableon Windows systems. 3: Make this problem prominent in the documentation andadvise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set the`GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path. 4: Resolve theexecutable manually by only looking into the `PATH` environment variable.",
