		"description": "Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leakingProxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to anHTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` toreattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connectionssent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the requestitself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. Howeverwhen sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in theCONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destinationserver unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentiallyexfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version2.31.0.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-32681` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-requests - 2.9.1-3ubuntu0.1+esm1\npython3-requests - 2.9.1-3ubuntu0.1+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
