		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:protect the fetch of ->fd[fd] in do_dup2() from mispredictionsboth callers have verified that fd is not greater than ->max_fds;however, misprediction might end up with        tofree = fdt->fd[fd];being speculatively executed.  That's wrong for the same reasonswhy it's wrong in close_fd()/file_close_fd_locked(); the samesolution applies - array_index_nospec(fd, fdt->max_fds) could differfrom fd only in case of speculative execution on mispredicted path.",
