    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in io_uring/poll.c in io_poll_check_events in the io_uring subcomponent in the Linux Kernel due to a race condition of poll_refs. This flaw may cause a NULL pointer dereference. Lin Ma discovered a race condition in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
