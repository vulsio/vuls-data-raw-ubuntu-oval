		"description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. On2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the securityteam found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin \"Text\". Thestored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to befully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cyclethat will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle theHTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs tohave the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript.Another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on \"Markdown\" or\"HTML\" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilegeescalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a knownpassword for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executesmalicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. This issue has been patched inversions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.",
