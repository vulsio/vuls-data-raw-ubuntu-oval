		"title": "CVE-2017-3738 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low",
		"description": "There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedureused in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of thisdefect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely.Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of thework necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performedoffline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would besignificant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the serverwould have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which isno longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors thatsupport the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4thgeneration). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736,CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severityof this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at thistime. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available.The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL gitrepository.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-3738` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10\nNo subscription required",
