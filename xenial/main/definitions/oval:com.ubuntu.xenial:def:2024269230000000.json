		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect() Garbage collectordoes not take into account the risk of embryo getting enqueued during thegarbage collection. If such embryo has a peer that carries SCM_RIGHTS, twoconsecutive passes of scan_children() may see a different set of children.Leading to an incorrectly elevated inflight count, and then a danglingpointer within the gc_inflight_list. sockets are AF_UNIX/SOCK_STREAM S isan unconnected socket L is a listening in-flight socket bound to addr, notin fdtable V's fd will be passed via sendmsg(), gets inflight count bumpedconnect(S, addr) sendmsg(S, [V]); close(V) __unix_gc() ----------------------------------------- ----------- NS = unix_create1() skb1 =sock_wmalloc(NS) L = unix_find_other(addr) unix_state_lock(L) unix_peer(S)= NS // V count=1 inflight=0 NS = unix_peer(S) skb2 = sock_alloc()skb_queue_tail(NS, skb2[V]) // V became in-flight // V count=2 inflight=1close(V) // V count=1 inflight=1 // GC candidate condition met for u ingc_inflight_list: if (total_refs == inflight_refs) add u to gc_candidates// gc_candidates={L, V} for u in gc_candidates: scan_children(u,dec_inflight) // embryo (skb1) was not // reachable from L yet, so V's //inflight remains unchanged __skb_queue_tail(L, skb1) unix_state_unlock(L)for u in gc_candidates: if (u.inflight) scan_children(u,inc_inflight_move_tail) // V count=1 inflight=2 (!) If there is aGC-candidate listening socket, lock/unlock its state. This makes GC waituntil the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. After flipping thelock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And if there isanother embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. At this point,unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is already taken.Inflight graph remains unaffected.",
