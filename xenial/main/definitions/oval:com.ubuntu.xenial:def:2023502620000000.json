		"description": "Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter for PHP. When parsing SVG images Dompdfperforms an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG areallowed. One of the validations is that the SVG document does not referenceitself. However, prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive chained using two ormore SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the systemconfiguration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available tothe executing process and/or to the server itself. php-svg-lib, when run inisolation, does not support SVG references for `image` elements. However,when used in combination with Dompdf, php-svg-lib will process SVG imagesreferenced by an `image` element. Dompdf currently includes validation toprevent self-referential `image` references, but a chained reference is notchecked. A malicious actor may thus trigger infinite recursion by chainingreferences between two or more SVG images. When Dompdf parses a maliciouspayload, it will crash due after exceeding the allowed execution time ormemory usage. An attacker sending multiple request to a system canpotentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system isunable to handle incoming request. Version 2.0.4 contains a fix for thisissue.",
