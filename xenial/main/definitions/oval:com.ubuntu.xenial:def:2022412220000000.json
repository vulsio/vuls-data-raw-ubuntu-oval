		"Title": "CVE-2022-41222 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "mm/mremap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 has a use-after-free via a stale TLB because an rmap lock is not held during a PUD move. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the memory address space accounting implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
