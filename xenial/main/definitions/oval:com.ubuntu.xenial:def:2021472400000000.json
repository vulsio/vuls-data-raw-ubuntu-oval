The problem was in wrong _size_ type: if (len!= ALIGN(size, 4) + hdrlen) goto err; If size from qrtr_hdr is 4294967293(0xfffffffd), the result of ALIGN(size, 4) will be 0. In case of len ==hdrlen and size == 4294967293 in header this check won't fail andskb_put_data(skb, data + hdrlen, size); will read out of bound from data,which is hdrlen allocated block.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47240` to fix the vulnerability.
