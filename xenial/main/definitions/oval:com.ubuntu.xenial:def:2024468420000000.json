		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_infoThe MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and theroutine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless ofreturn status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmwarereturns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory regionreferences previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.Fix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailboxresource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did nottimeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resourcesbecause it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a latertime in its cmpl routine.Also, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate bootscripts requiring longer timeouts.",
