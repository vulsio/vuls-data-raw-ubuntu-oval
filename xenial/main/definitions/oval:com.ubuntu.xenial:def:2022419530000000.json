		"Description": "Git GUI is a convenient graphical tool that comes with Git for Windows. Itstarget audience is users who are uncomfortable with using Git on thecommand-line. Git GUI has a function to clone repositories. Immediatelyafter the local clone is available, Git GUI will automatically post-processit, among other things running a spell checker called `aspell.exe` if itwas found. Git GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk script. Due to theunfortunate design of Tcl on Windows, the search path when looking for anexecutable _always includes the current directory_. Therefore, maliciousrepositories can ship with an `aspell.exe` in their top-level directorywhich is executed by Git GUI without giving the user a chance to inspect itfirst, i.e. running untrusted code. This issue has been addressed inversion 2.39.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgradeshould avoid using Git GUI for cloning. If that is not a viable option, atleast avoid cloning from untrusted sources.",
