Hugo dependson Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandocdocuments if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. InHugo before version 0.79.1, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe`or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time of running`hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one.Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected.Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1. Other than avoiding untrusted Hugosites, there is no workaround.",
