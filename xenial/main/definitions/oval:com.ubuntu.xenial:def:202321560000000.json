		"Title": "CVE-2023-2156 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the networking subsystem of the Linux kernel within the handling of the RPL protocol. This issue results from the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data, which can lead to an assertion failure. This may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition on the system. It was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle user-supplied data. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
