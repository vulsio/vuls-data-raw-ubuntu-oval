		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk In cachestat, we accessthe folio from the page cache's xarray to compute its page offset, andcheck for its dirty and writeback flags. However, we do not hold areference to the folio before performing these actions, which means thefolio can concurrently be released and reused as another folio/page/slab.Get around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery forthe folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states. This changes behaviorfor tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their dirty and writebackcounters. This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow conventional writeback cachebehavior: its pages get \"cleaned\" during swapout, after which they're nolonger resident etc.",
