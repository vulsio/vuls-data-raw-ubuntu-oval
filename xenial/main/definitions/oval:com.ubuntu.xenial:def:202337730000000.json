    "Title": "CVE-2023-3773 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to cause a 4 byte out-of-bounds read of XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH when parsing netlink attributes, leading to potential leakage of sensitive heap data to userspace. Lin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a policy data structure, leading to an out-of-bounds vulnerability. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
