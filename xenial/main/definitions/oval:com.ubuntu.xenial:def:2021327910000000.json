		"Description": "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party,authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. Inmod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption inmod_auth_openidc uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix becausethis creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this canlead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused.From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values throughusage of cjose AES encryption routines.",
