		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ssb: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ssb_device_uevent()The ssb_device_uevent() function first attempts to convert the 'dev'pointerto 'struct ssb_device *'. However, it mistakenly dereferences 'dev' beforeperforming the NULL check, potentially leading to a NULL pointerdereference if 'dev' is NULL.To fix this issue, move the NULL check before dereferencing the 'dev'pointer,ensuring that the pointer is valid before attempting to use it.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
