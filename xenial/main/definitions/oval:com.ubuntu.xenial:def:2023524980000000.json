		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM codeIt is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume corecode deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argumentfunction synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only inthat case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is alreadyheld.  Executing the argument function synchronously from withindpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it maycause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before arequisite supplier device's one, for example).Address this by changing the code in question to useasync_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronousexecution of device suspend and resume functions and to directlyrun them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.",
