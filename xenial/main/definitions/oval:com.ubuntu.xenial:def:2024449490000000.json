		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:parisc: fix a possible DMA corruptionARCH_DMA_MINALIGN was defined as 16 - this is too small - it may bepossible that two unrelated 16-byte allocations share a cache line. Ifone of these allocations is written using DMA and the other is writtenusing cached write, the value that was written with DMA may becorrupted.This commit changes ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to be 128 on PA20 and 32 on PA1.1 -that's the largest possible cache line size.As different parisc microarchitectures have different cache line size, wedefine arch_slab_minalign(), cache_line_size() anddma_get_cache_alignment() so that the kernel may tune slab cacheparameters dynamically, based on the detected cache line size.",
