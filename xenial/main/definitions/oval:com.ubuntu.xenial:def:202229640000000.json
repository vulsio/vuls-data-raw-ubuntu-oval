    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes. Jann Horn discovered that the ASIX AX88179/178A USB Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained multiple out-of-bounds vulnerabilities. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
