		"description": "LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allowremote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request(intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a clientto send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum sizeallowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size fornormal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum sizeis then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests andexecuted, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example,if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for colorcodes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the runninggraphical session.",
