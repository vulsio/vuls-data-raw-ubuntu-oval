    "Title": "CVE-2020-26160 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\"aud\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26160` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njuju - 2.3.7-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\njuju-2.0 - 2.3.7-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
