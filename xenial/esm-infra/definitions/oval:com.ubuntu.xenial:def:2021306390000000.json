		"description": "A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely trigger adenial of service. An error introduced as part of a change to improve errorhandling during non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated withthe Request object was not reset between requests. This meant that once anon-blocking I/O error occurred, all future requests handled by thatrequest object would fail. Users were able to trigger non-blocking I/Oerrors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby creating the possibility oftriggering a DoS. Applications that do not use non-blocking I/O are notexposed to this vulnerability. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.3 to10.0.4; 9.0.44; 8.5.64.",
