		"Title": "CVE-2021-37701 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code executionvulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose locationwould be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part,achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks.Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determinewhether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories arecreated. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files thatcontained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as thedirectory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry usedbackslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logicused both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a validfilename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, andthen replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible tobypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing anuntrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequentlyextracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary filecreation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise oncase-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at`FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitivefile systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directoryfrom the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as itwould not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the`FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link,thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues wereaddressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tarhas been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If youare still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recentversion of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available inthe referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.",
