		"Title": "CVE-2023-34319 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The fix for XSA-423 added logic to Linux'es netback driver to deal with afrontend splitting a packet in a way such that not all of the headers wouldcome in one piece. Unfortunately the logic introduced there didn't accountfor the extreme case of the entire packet being split into as many piecesas permitted by the protocol, yet still being smaller than the area that'sspecially dealt with to keep all (possible) headers together. Such anunusual packet would therefore trigger a buffer overrun in the driver.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-34319` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-246-generic - 4.4.0-246.280\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-246-generic - 4.4.0-246.280\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-246-lowlatency - 4.4.0-246.280\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-lowlatency - 4.15.0-219.230~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1125-kvm - 4.4.0-1125.135\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1162-aws - 4.4.0-1162.177\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1162.175~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-gcp - 4.15.0-1156.173~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1125-oracle - 4.15.0-1125.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
