    "Description": "An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way SSH packets with a padding length value greater than the packet length are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory. It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled padding value in SSH packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information.",
