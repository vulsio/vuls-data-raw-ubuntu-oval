		"Title": "CVE-2021-32050 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Some MongoDB Drivers may erroneously publish events containingauthentication-related data to a command listener configured by anapplication. The published events may contain security-sensitive data whenspecific authentication-related commands are executed. Without due care, anapplication may inadvertently expose this sensitive information, e.g., bywriting it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enablesthe command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issueaffects the MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7, MongoDB PHP Driver1.0.0 prior to 1.9.2, MongoDB Swift Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.1.1, MongoDBNode.js Driver 3.6 prior to 3.6.10, MongoDB Node.js Driver 4.0 prior to4.17.0 and MongoDB Node.js Driver 5.0 prior to 5.8.0. This issue alsoaffects users of the MongoDB C++ Driver dependent on the C driver 1.0.0prior to 1.17.7 (C++ driver prior to 3.7.0).",
