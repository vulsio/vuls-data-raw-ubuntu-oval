		"Title": "CVE-2022-45411 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via theTrace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers andcookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly).To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> andXMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standardheaders such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTPmethod, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied thesame mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerabilityaffects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.",
