    "Title": "CVE-2021-3564 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw double-free memory corruption in the Linux kernel HCI device initialization subsystem was found in the way user attach malicious HCI TTY Bluetooth device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. This flaw affects all the Linux kernel versions starting from 3.13. It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle HCI device initialization failure, leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3564` to fix the vulnerability.
