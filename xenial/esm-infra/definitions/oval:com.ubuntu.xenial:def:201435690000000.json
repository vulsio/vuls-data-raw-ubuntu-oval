		"Title": "CVE-2014-3569 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "The ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8zc, 1.0.0o, and 1.0.1j does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an unexpected handshake, as demonstrated by an SSLv3 handshake to a no-ssl3 application with certain error handling.  NOTE: this issue became relevant after the CVE-2014-3568 fix.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-3569` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu10\nopenssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu10\nNo subscription required",
