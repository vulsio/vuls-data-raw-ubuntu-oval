    "Title": "CVE-2018-10897 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A directory traversal issue was found in reposync, a part of yum-utils, where reposync fails to sanitize paths in remote repository configuration files. If an attacker controls a repository, they may be able to copy files outside of the destination directory on the targeted system via path traversal. If reposync is running with heightened privileges on a targeted system, this flaw could potentially result in system compromise via the overwriting of critical system files. Version 1.1.31 and older are believed to be affected.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10897` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nyum-utils - 1.1.31-2.2\nNo subscription required",
