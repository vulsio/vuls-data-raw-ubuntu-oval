    "Title": "CVE-2016-10728 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata before 3.1.2. If an ICMPv4 error packet is received as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it confuses the rule grouping lookup logic. The toclient inspection will then continue with the wrong rule group. This can lead to missed detection.",
