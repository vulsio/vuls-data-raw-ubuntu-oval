		"Title": "CVE-2020-36311 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.9. arch/x86/kvm/svm/sev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) by triggering destruction of a large SEV VM (which requires unregistering many encrypted regions), aka CID-7be74942f184. It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not ensure enough processing time was given to perform cleanups of large SEV VMs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (soft lockup).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-36311` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nNo subscription required",
