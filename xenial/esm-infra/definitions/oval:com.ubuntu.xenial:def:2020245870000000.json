		"Title": "CVE-2020-24587 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled encrypted fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to decrypt fragments.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-24587` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
