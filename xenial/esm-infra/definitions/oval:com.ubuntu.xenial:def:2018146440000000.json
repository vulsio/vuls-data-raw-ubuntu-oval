		"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including4.1.4. A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT canlead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It onlyarises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers forthat parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of themeta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSECvalidation will be answered with a ServFail.",
