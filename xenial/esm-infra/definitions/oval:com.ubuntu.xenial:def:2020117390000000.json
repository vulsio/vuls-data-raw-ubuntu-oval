		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users tocause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of missingmemory barriers in read-write unlock paths. The read-write unlock pathsdon't contain a memory barrier. On Arm, this means a processor is allowedto re-order the memory access with the preceding ones. In other words, theunlock may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesseswithin the \"critical\" section. As a consequence, it may be possible to havea writer executing a critical section at the same time as readers oranother writer. In other words, many of the assumptions (e.g., a variablecannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safeanymore. The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-tableones), so a malicious guest could exploit the race. For instance, there isa small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is usedconcurrently. A malicious guest may be able to leak memory, or cause ahypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leakand privilege escalation cannot be excluded.",
