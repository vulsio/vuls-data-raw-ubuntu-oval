    "Title": "CVE-2020-26144 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as long as the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP) header for EAPOL. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled certain malformed frames. A physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject arbitrary network packets.",
