		"title": "CVE-2020-24588 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, andWPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDUflag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devicesthat support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-24588` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
