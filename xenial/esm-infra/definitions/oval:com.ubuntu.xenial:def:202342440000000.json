		"Title": "CVE-2023-4244 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Due to a race condition between nf_tables netlink control plane transaction and nft_set element garbage collection, it is possible to underflow the reference counter causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 3e91b0ebd994635df2346353322ac51ce84ce6d8. Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",

USN-6443-1 was firstly announced fixing this CVE for linux-oem-6.1 in version 6.1.0-1024.24, but one of the fix commits was missing in that version. The complete fix in linux-oem-6.1 is available in version 6.1.0-1025.25."
