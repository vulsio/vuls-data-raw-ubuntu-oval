    "Note": "ccdm94> in issue 704, which references this CVE, there is mention of commit d26481f24bd (mayeut/openjpeg), which seems to be aimed at fixing this issue. This commit, however, was not included by upstream. The code has changed to something that is similar to what is proposed in the previously mentioned non-merged commit, and the commit that did this was ad593c9e062. This seems to be the same fix as the one for CVE-2016-3182. Considering that this is the fix for the issue, even if package openjpeg (versions 1.x) is affected (PoC does not reproduce), the only likely upstream patch does not apply as the function being patched does not exist in versions 1.x. No other possible patch has been explicitly provided by upstream."
