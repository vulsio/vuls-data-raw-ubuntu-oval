    "Title": "CVE-2022-20422 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "In emulation_proc_handler of armv8_deprecated.c, there is a possible way to corrupt memory due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-237540956References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that a race condition existed in the instruction emulator of the Linux kernel on Arm 64-bit systems. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-20422` to fix the vulnerability.
