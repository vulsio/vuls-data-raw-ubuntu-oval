		"Title": "CVE-2021-29265 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.7. usbip_sockfd_store in drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status, aka CID-9380afd6df70. It was discovered that the USB/IP driver in the Linux kernel contained race conditions during the update of local and shared status. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29265` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1126-aws - 4.4.0-1126.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
