		"description": "The olm_session_describe function in Matrix libolm before 3.2.7 isvulnerable to a buffer overflow. The Olm session object represents acryptographic channel between two parties. Therefore, its state ispartially controllable by the remote party of the channel. Attackers canconstruct a crafted sequence of messages to manipulate the state of thereceiver's session in such a way that, for some buffer sizes, a bufferoverflow happens on a call to olm_session_describe. Furthermore, safebuffer sizes were undocumented. The overflow content is partiallycontrollable by the attacker and limited to ASCII spaces and digits. Theknown affected products are Element Web And SchildiChat Web.",
