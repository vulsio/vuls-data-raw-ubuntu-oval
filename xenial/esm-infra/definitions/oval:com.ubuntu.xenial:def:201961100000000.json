		"Note": "seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using sftp instead of scp.  Per https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2019-January/037475.html upstream doesn't consider this to be a vulnerability, and as of 2020-07-07, there is no upstream fix. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu stable releases."
