    "Title": "CVE-2021-38205 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM pointer). It was discovered that the Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the Linux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations. An attacker could use this information to ease the exploitation of another vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-38205` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-aws - 4.15.0-1112.119~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-gcp - 4.15.0-1109.123~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-lowlatency - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-oracle - 4.15.0-1081.89~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-aws - 4.15.0-1112.119~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-gcp - 4.15.0-1109.123~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-lowlatency - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-oracle - 4.15.0-1081.89~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
