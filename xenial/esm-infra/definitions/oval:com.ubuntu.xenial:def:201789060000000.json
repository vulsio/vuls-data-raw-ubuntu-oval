    "Title": "CVE-2017-8906 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An integer underflow vulnerability exists in pixel-a.asm, the x86 assembly code for planeClipAndMax() in MulticoreWare x265 through 2.4, as used by the x265_encoder_encode dependency in libbpg and other products. A small picture can cause an integer underflow, which leads to a Denial of Service in the process of encoding.",

Upstream has not released a patch, rather, they have \"disabled 'planeClipAndMax' assembly primitives\" ccdm94> it seems like upstream has already closed this issue and will be providing a fix for it other than the suggested disabling of the 'planeClipAndMax' assembly primitives. Therefore, considering that this has been deferred for 5+ years and there were no further changes that allow this to be patched in xenial, xenial will be marked as ignored."
