		"description": "An issue was discovered in the auth component in Dovecot 2.2 and 2.3 before2.3.20. When two passdb configuration entries exist with the same driverand args settings, incorrect username_filter and mechanism settings can beapplied to passdb definitions. These incorrectly applied settings can leadto an unintended security configuration and can permit privilege escalationin certain configurations. The documentation does not advise against theuse of passdb definitions that have the same driver and args settings. Onesuch configuration would be where an administrator wishes to use the samePAM configuration or passwd file for both normal and master users but usethe username_filter setting to restrict which of the users is able to be amaster user.",
