		"Title": "CVE-2021-29650 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The netfilter subsystem allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value, aka CID-175e476b8cdf. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29650` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1138-aws - 4.4.0-1138.152\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1103-kvm - 4.4.0-1103.112\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147~16.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
