Waitress would header fold a doubleContent-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now commaseparated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally.If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress wouldtreat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of therequest as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed inWaitress 1.4.0.",
