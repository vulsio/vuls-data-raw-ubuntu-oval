		"description": "The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to facilitate andstandardize the distribution of content. In the OCI DistributionSpecification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone wasused to determine the type of document during push and pull operations.Documents that contain both “manifests” and “layers” fields could beinterpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of anaccompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed betweentwo pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting contentdifferently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to requirethat a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match theContent-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clientspulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject anambiguous document that contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or“manifests” and “config” fields if they are unable to update to version1.0.1 of the spec.",
