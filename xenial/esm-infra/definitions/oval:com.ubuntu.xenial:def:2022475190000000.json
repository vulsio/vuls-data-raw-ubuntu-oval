    "Title": "CVE-2022-47519 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_OPER_CHANNEL in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds write when parsing the channel list attribute from Wi-Fi management frames. It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate specific attributes, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
