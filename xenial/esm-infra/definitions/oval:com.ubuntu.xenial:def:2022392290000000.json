		"title": "CVE-2022-39229 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - negligible",
		"description": "Grafana is an open source data visualization platform for metrics, logs,and traces. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to blockanother user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email address asa username. A Grafana user’s username and email address are unique fields,that means no other user can have the same username or email address asanother user. A user can have an email address as a username. However, thelogin system allows users to log in with either username or email address.Since Grafana allows a user to log in with either their username or emailaddress, this creates an usual behavior where `user_1` can register withone email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`’semail address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since`user_1`'s password won’t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.",
