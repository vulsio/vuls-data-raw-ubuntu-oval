		"Description": "A flaw was found in chrony versions before 3.5.1 when creating the PID fileunder the /var/run/chrony folder. The file is created during chronydstartup while still running as the root user, and when it's opened forwriting, chronyd does not check for an existing symbolic link with the samefile name. This flaw allows an attacker with privileged access to create asymlink with the default PID file name pointing to any destination file inthe system, resulting in data loss and a denial of service due to the pathtraversal.",
