		"Title": "CVE-2022-23036 on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNAinformation record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains whichaspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV devicefrontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rightsof the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting inpotential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial ofservice triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront andthe gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use.If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of thegranted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backendhas mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result thebackend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how thepage will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driverhas a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing thegranted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront:CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus:CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p,kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grantreference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related datapage is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result thebackend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed andthen re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail aBUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This willresult in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which can betriggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23036` to fix the vulnerability.
