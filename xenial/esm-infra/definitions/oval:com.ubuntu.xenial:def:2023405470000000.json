		"description": "[avoid incorrectly trusting HTTP headersWhen retrieving files via HTTP or related protocols, shim attempts toallocate a buffer to store the received data.  Unfortunately, this meansgetting the size from an HTTP header, which can be manipulated tospecify a size that's smaller than the received data.  In this case, thecode accidentally uses the header for the allocation but the protocolmetadata to copy it from the rx buffer, resulting in an out-of-boundswrite.This patch adds an additional check to test that the rx buffer is notlarger than the allocation.]",
