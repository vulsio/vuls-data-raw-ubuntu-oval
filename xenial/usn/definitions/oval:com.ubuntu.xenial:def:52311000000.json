		"title": "USN-5231-1 -- 389 Directory Server vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that 389 Directory Server presented to users, during authentication, an error message which could be used to discover if a certain LDAP DN existed or not. A remote unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this to check the existence of an entry in a LDAP database and expose sensitive information. This issue affected only Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2020-35518)  It was discovered that 389 Directory Server was incorrectly validating data used to access memory addresses. An authenticated attacker using a Syncrepl client could use this issue with a specially crafted query to cause 389 Directory Server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3514)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5231-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  389-ds-base - 1.3.4.9-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 389-ds - 1.3.4.9-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 389-ds-base-libs - 1.3.4.9-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 389-ds-base-dev - 1.3.4.9-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
