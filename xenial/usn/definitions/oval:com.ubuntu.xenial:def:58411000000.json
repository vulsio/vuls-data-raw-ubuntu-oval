		"description": "It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.
