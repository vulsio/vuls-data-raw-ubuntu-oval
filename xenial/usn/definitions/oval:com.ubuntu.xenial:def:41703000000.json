		"description": "USN-4170-1 fixed a vulnerability in Whoopsie and USN-4170-2 fixed a subsequent regression. That update was incomplete and could still result in Whoopsie potentially crashing when uploading crash reports on some architectures.  This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Kevin Backhouse discovered Whoopsie incorrectly handled very large crash  reports. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial  of service, expose sensitive information or execute code as the whoopsie  user.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4170-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  whoopsie - 0.2.52.5ubuntu0.4 libwhoopsie0 - 0.2.52.5ubuntu0.4 libwhoopsie-dev - 0.2.52.5ubuntu0.4 No subscription required",
