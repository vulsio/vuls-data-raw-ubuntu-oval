		"title": "USN-3342-2 -- Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "USN-3342-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.10. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.10 for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  USN-3333-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Linux kernel. However, that fix introduced regressions for some Java applications. This update addresses the issue. We apologize for the inconvenience.  It was discovered that a use-after-free flaw existed in the filesystem encryption subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-7374)  Roee Hay discovered that the parallel port printer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly bounds check passed arguments. A local attacker with write access to the kernel command line arguments could use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-1000363)  Ingo Molnar discovered that the VideoCore DRM driver in the Linux kernel did not return an error after detecting certain overflows. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service (OOPS). (CVE-2017-5577)  Li Qiang discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7294)  It was discovered that a double-free vulnerability existed in the IPv4 stack of the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-8890)  Andrey Konovalov discovered an IPv6 out-of-bounds read error in the Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9074)  Andrey Konovalov discovered a flaw in the handling of inheritance in the Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9075)  It was discovered that dccp v6 in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9076)  It was discovered that the transmission control protocol (tcp) v6 in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9077)  It was discovered that the IPv6 stack in the Linux kernel was performing its over write consistency check after the data was actually overwritten. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-9242)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3342-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-4.8.0-58-generic - 4.8.0-58.63~16.04.1 linux-image-4.8.0-58-generic-lpae - 4.8.0-58.63~16.04.1 linux-image-4.8.0-58-generic - 4.8.0-58.63~16.04.1 linux-image-4.8.0-58-lowlatency - 4.8.0-58.63~16.04.1 No subscription required",
