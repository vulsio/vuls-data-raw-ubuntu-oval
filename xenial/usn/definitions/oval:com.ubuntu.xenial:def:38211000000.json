		"description": "Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-10880)  It was discovered that the alarmtimer implementation in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-13053)  Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-13096)  Wen Xu and Po-Ning Tseng discovered that the btrfs filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle relocations in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14609)  Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14617)  Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-17972)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel on ARM 64bit processors did not properly handle some ioctls. An attacker with the privilege to create KVM-based virtual machines could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash) or execute arbitrary code in the host. (CVE-2018-18021)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3821-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1037-kvm - 4.4.0-1037.43 No subscription required  linux-image-4.4.0-1072-aws - 4.4.0-1072.82 No subscription required  linux-image-4.4.0-1100-raspi2 - 4.4.0-1100.108 No subscription required  linux-image-4.4.0-1104-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1104.109 No subscription required  linux-image-4.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-139.165 linux-image-4.4.0-139-lowlatency - 4.4.0-139.165 linux-image-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165 linux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-139.165 linux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-139.165 linux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-139.165 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165 linux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-139.165 No subscription required",
