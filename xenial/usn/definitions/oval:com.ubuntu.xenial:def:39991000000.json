		"description": "Eyal Ronen, Kenneth G. Paterson, and Adi Shamir discovered that GnuTLS was vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack known as the \"Lucky Thirteen\" issue. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform plaintext-recovery attacks via analysis of timing data. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-10844, CVE-2018-10845, CVE-2018-10846)  Tavis Ormandy discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled memory when verifying certain X.509 certificates. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause GnuTLS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.10, and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-3829)  It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled certain post-handshake messages. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause GnuTLS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.10 and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-3836)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3999-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  gnutls-doc - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 libgnutls28-dev - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 libgnutls-openssl27 - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 libgnutls30 - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 libgnutls-dev - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 gnutls-bin - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 guile-gnutls - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 libgnutlsxx28 - 3.4.10-4ubuntu1.5 No subscription required",
