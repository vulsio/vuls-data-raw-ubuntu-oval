		"description": "It was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly verify certain input when processing video and audio files. An attacker could possibly use this to send specially crafted input to the application, force a division by zero, and cause a denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2020-20445, CVE-2020-20446, CVE-2020-20453, CVE-2020-20892)  It was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly perform certain bit shift and memory operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-20902)  It was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly perform memory management operations in various of its functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to send specially crafted input to the application and cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-21041, CVE-2020-20451, CVE-2020-21688, CVE-2020-21697, CVE-2020-22020, CVE-2020-22021, CVE-2020-22022, CVE-2020-22025, CVE-2020-22031, CVE-2020-22032, CVE-2020-22037, CVE-2020-22040, CVE-2020-22041, CVE-2020-22042, CVE-2020-22044)  It was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly perform memory management operations in various of its functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to send specially crafted input to the application and cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-22016, CVE-2020-22046, CVE-2020-22049, CVE-2020-22054)  It was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly perform memory management operations in various of its functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to send specially crafted input to the application and cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-35965)  It was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly handle data assigned to the tty demuxer. An attacker could possibly use this issue to send specially crafted input to the application and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3566)  It was discovered that FFmpeg did not perform checks on function return values when encoding and formatting input video and audio files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-38114, CVE-2021-38171)  It was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly sanitize function returned data when calculating frame duration values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause an assertion failure and then cause a denial of service (application crash).
