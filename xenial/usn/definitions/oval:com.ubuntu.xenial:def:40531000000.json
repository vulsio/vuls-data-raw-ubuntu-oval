		"description": "It was discovered that GVfs incorrectly handled the admin backend. Files created or moved by the admin backend could end up with the wrong ownership information, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.10, and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-12447, CVE-2019-12448, CVE-2019-12449)  It was discovered that GVfs incorrectly handled authentication on its private D-Bus socket. A local attacker could possibly connect to this socket and issue D-Bus calls. (CVE-2019-12795)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4053-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  gvfs-backends - 1.28.2-1ubuntu1~16.04.3 gvfs-libs - 1.28.2-1ubuntu1~16.04.3 gvfs-daemons - 1.28.2-1ubuntu1~16.04.3 gvfs-bin - 1.28.2-1ubuntu1~16.04.3 gvfs-common - 1.28.2-1ubuntu1~16.04.3 gvfs-fuse - 1.28.2-1ubuntu1~16.04.3 gvfs - 1.28.2-1ubuntu1~16.04.3 No subscription required",
