		"description": "It was discovered that mbedtls has a bounds-check bypass through an integer overflow that can be used by an attacked to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-18187)  It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability where an attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) via a crafted certificate chain that is mishandled during RSASSA-PSS signature verification within a TLS or DTLS session. (CVE-2018-0487)  It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability where an attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap corruption) via a crafted application packet within a TLS or DTLS session. (CVE-2018-0488)  It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to achieve partial plaintext recovery (for a CBC based ciphersuite) via a timing-based side-channel attack. (CVE-2018-0497)  It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability that allows local users to achieve partial plaintext recovery (for a CBC based ciphersuite) via a cache-based side-channel attack. (CVE-2018-0498)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4267-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libmbedtls-doc - 2.2.1-2ubuntu0.3 libmbedtls-dev - 2.2.1-2ubuntu0.3 libmbedtls10 - 2.2.1-2ubuntu0.3 libmbedcrypto0 - 2.2.1-2ubuntu0.3 libmbedx509-0 - 2.2.1-2ubuntu0.3 No subscription required",
