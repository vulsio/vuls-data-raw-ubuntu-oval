		"title": "USN-3617-2 -- Linux (HWE) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "USN-3617-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 17.10. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 17.10 for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2017-1000407)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15129)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the usbtest device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16532)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16537)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IMS Passenger Control Unit USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16645)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the DiBcom DiB0700 USB DVB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle detach events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16646)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ASIX Ethernet USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle suspend and resume events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16647)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16649)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the QMI WWAN USB driver did not properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16650)  It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-16994)  It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2017-17448)  It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt_osf) module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list. (CVE-2017-17450)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-17741)  It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-17805)  It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17806)  It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to unauthorized keyrings. (CVE-2017-17807)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2017-18204)  It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface unavailability). (CVE-2018-1000026)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5332)  Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-5333)  范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5344)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3617-2` to fix the vulnerability.
