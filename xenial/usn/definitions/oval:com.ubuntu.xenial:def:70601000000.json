		"title": "USN-7060-1 -- EDK II vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that EDK II did not check the buffer length in XHCI,  which could lead to a stack overflow. A local attacker could potentially use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-0161)  Laszlo Ersek discovered that EDK II incorrectly handled recursion. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause EDK II to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-28210)  Satoshi Tanda discovered that EDK II incorrectly handled decompressing certain images. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause EDK II to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-28211)  It was discovered that EDK II incorrectly decoded certain strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause EDK II to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only  affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-38575)  It was discovered that EDK II had integer underflow vulnerability in  SmmEntryPoint, which could result in a buffer overflow. An attacker could potentially use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-38578)  Elison Niven discovered that OpenSSL, vendored in EDK II, incorrectly  handled the c_rehash script. A local attacker could possibly use this  issue to execute arbitrary commands when c_rehash is run. This issue  only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1292)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7060-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ovmf - 0~20160408.ffea0a2c-2ubuntu0.2+esm3 qemu-efi - 0~20160408.ffea0a2c-2ubuntu0.2+esm3 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
