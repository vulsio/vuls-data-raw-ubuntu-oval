		"description": "It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other out- of-bounds access, which can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-7039)  It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator misuses snprintf return values. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-8608)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4632-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  slirp - 1:1.0.17-8ubuntu16.04.1 No subscription required",
