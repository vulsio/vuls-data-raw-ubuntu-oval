		"description": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-14615)  It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15099)  It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-16229)  It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-16232)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2019-18683)  It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-18786)  It was discovered that the Afatech AF9005 DVB-T USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-18809)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-18885)  It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19057)  It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19062)  It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19063)  It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19071)  It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19078)  It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19082)  Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19227)  It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19332)  It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19767)  Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19965)  It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20096)  Mitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel when used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations before client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-5108)  It was discovered that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free while destroying GEM contexts in the i915 driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-7053)  It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15291)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4287-1` to fix the vulnerability.
