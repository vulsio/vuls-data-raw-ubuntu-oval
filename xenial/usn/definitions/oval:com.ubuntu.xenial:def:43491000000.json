		"description": "A buffer overflow was discovered in the network stack. An unprivileged user could potentially enable escalation of privilege and/or denial of service. This issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04 LTS and 19.10. (CVE-2018-12178)  A buffer overflow was discovered in BlockIo service.

(CVE-2018-12180)  A stack overflow was discovered in bmp. An unprivileged user could potentially enable denial of service or elevation of privilege via local access. This issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04 LTS and 19.10. (CVE-2018-12181)  It was discovered that memory was not cleared before free that could lead to potential password leak. (CVE-2019-14558)  A memory leak was discovered in ArpOnFrameRcvdDpc. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2019-14559)  An integer overflow was discovered in MdeModulePkg/PiDxeS3BootScriptLib. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2019-14563)  It was discovered that the affected version doesn't properly check whether an unsigned EFI file should be allowed or not.
