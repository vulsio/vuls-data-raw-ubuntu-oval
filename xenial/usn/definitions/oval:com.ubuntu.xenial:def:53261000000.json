		"description": "It was discovered that FUSE is susceptible to a restriction bypass flaw on a system that has SELinux active. A local attacker with non-root privileges could mount a FUSE file system that is accessible to other users and trick them into accessing files on that file system, which  could result in a Denial of Service or other unspecified conditions.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5326-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libfuse2 - 2.9.4-1ubuntu3.1+esm1 fuse - 2.9.4-1ubuntu3.1+esm1 libfuse-dev - 2.9.4-1ubuntu3.1+esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
