(CVE-2021-25293)  Jiayi Lin, Luke Shaffer, Xinran Xie, and Akshay Ajayan discovered that Pillow incorrectly handled certain BLP files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-crafted BLP file, a remote attacker could possibly cause Pillow to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.10. (CVE-2021-27921)  Jiayi Lin, Luke Shaffer, Xinran Xie, and Akshay Ajayan discovered that Pillow incorrectly handled certain ICNS files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-crafted ICNS file, a remote attacker could possibly cause Pillow to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-27922)  Jiayi Lin, Luke Shaffer, Xinran Xie, and Akshay Ajayan discovered that Pillow incorrectly handled certain ICO files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-crafted ICO file, a remote attacker could possibly cause Pillow to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.
