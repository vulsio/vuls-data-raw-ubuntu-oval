		"description": "It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain regular expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service while processing a specially crafted regular expression. (CVE-2020-2754, CVE-2020-2755)  It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled class descriptors and catching exceptions during object stream deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service while processing a specially crafted serialized input. (CVE-2020-2756, CVE-2020-2757)  Bengt Jonsson, Juraj Somorovsky, Kostis Sagonas, Paul Fiterau Brostean and Robert Merget discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certificate messages during TLS handshake. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certificate verification and insert, edit or obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected OpenJDK 11. (CVE-2020-2767)  It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled exceptions thrown by unmarshalKeyInfo() and unmarshalXMLSignature(). An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service while reading key info or XML signature data from XML input. (CVE-2020-2773)  Peter Dettman discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled SSLParameters in setAlgorithmConstraints(). An attacker could possibly use this issue to override the defined systems security policy and lead to the use of weak crypto algorithms that should be disabled. This issue only affected OpenJDK 11. (CVE-2020-2778)  Simone Bordet discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly re-used single null TLS sessions for new TLS connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-2781)  Dan Amodio discovered that OpenJDK did not restrict the use of CR and LF characters in values for HTTP headers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to insert, edit or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2020-2800)  Nils Emmerich discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked boundaries or argument types. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass sandbox restrictions causing unspecified impact. (CVE-2020-2803, CVE-2020-2805)  It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled application data packets during TLS handshake. An attacker could possibly use this issue to insert, edit or obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected OpenJDK 11. (CVE-2020-2816)  It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain regular expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-2830)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4337-1` to fix the vulnerability.
