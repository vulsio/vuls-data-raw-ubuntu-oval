		"description": "Tilman Schmidt and Sasha Levin discovered a use-after-free condition in the TTY implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2015-8964)  It was discovered that the Video For Linux Two (v4l2) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle multiple planes when processing a VIDIOC_DQBUF ioctl(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4568)  CAI Qian discovered that shared bind mounts in a mount namespace exponentially added entries without restriction to the Linux kernel's mount table. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-6213)  Andreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a setxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group privileges. (CVE-2016-7097)  Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2016-7425)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation for x86/x86_64 in the Linux kernel could dereference a null pointer. An attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the KVM host. (CVE-2016-8630)  Eyal Itkin discovered that the IP over IEEE 1394 (FireWire) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling fragmented packets. A remote attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-8633)  Marco Grassi discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel mishandles socket buffer (skb) truncation. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-8645)  Daxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2016-8658)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled validation of incoming data. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-9555)  It was discovered that the __get_user_asm_ex implementation in the Linux kernel for x86/x86_64 contained extended asm statements that were incompatible with the exception table. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-9644)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3161-4` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1042-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1042.46 No subscription required",
