		"description": "An out of bounds write was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1660)  It was discovered that Blink assumes that a frame which passes same-origin checks is local in some cases. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1661)  A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1663)  It was discovered that the JSGenericLowering class in V8 mishandles comparison operators. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-1665)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1666)  It was discovered that the TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded function in Blink does not prevent script execution during node-adoption operations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1667)  It was discovered that the forEachForBinding in the V8 bindings in Blink uses an improper creation context. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1668)  A buffer overflow was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1669)  A race condition was discovered in ResourceDispatcherHostImpl in Chromium. An attacker could potentially exploit this to make arbitrary HTTP requests. (CVE-2016-1670)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2960-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  liboxideqtcore0 - 1.14.9-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 liboxideqt-qmlplugin - 1.14.9-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 liboxideqtquick-dev - 1.14.9-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 oxideqt-codecs-extra - 1.14.9-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 liboxideqtcore-dev - 1.14.9-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 oxideqt-codecs - 1.14.9-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 liboxideqtquick0 - 1.14.9-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 No subscription required",
