		"description": "USN-6078-1 fixed a vulnerability in libwebp. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  Original advisory details:   Irvan Kurniawan discovered that libwebp incorrectly handled certain memory  operations. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a  specially crafted image file, a remote attacker could use this issue to  cause libwebp to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly  execute arbitrary code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6078-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libwebp5 - 0.4.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm2 webp - 0.4.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm2 libwebpdemux1 - 0.4.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm2 libwebp-dev - 0.4.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm2 libwebpmux1 - 0.4.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
