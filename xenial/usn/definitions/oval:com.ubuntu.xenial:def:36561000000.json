		"description": "Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007 driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17975)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18193)  It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-18222)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-1065)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly validate ebtables offsets. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-1068)  It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1130)  It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-5803)  It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7480)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-7757)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7995)  Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8781)  Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8822)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3656-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1090-raspi2 - 4.4.0-1090.98 No subscription required  linux-image-4.4.0-1093-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1093.98 No subscription required",
