		"description": "Florian Weimer discovered that Sudo incorrectly handled the noexec restriction when used with certain applications. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass configured restrictions and execute arbitrary commands. (CVE-2016-7076)  It was discovered that Sudo did not properly parse the contents of /proc/[pid]/stat when attempting to determine its controlling tty. A local attacker in some configurations could possibly use this to overwrite any file on the filesystem, bypassing intended permissions. (CVE-2017-1000368)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3968-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  sudo-ldap - 1.8.16-0ubuntu1.6 sudo - 1.8.16-0ubuntu1.6 No subscription required",
