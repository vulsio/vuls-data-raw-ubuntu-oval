		"description": "Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-3135)  It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-4470)  Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-4794)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-5243)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3056-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1019-raspi2 - 4.4.0-1019.25 No subscription required",
