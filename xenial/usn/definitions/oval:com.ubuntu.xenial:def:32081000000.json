		"description": "It was discovered that the generic SCSI block layer in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict write operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-10088)  CAI Qian discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations. An unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2016-9191)  Jim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel mismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash). (CVE-2016-9588)  Andy Lutomirski and Willy Tarreau discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly emulate instructions on the SS segment register. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges in the guest OS. (CVE-2017-2583)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel improperly emulated certain instructions. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-2584)  It was discovered that the KLSI KL5KUSB105 serial-to-USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory related to logging. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-5549)  Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-6074)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3208-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1048-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1048.52 No subscription required  linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-64.85 linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-64.85 linux-image-4.4.0-64-generic - 4.4.0-64.85 linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-64.85 linux-image-4.4.0-64-lowlatency - 4.4.0-64.85 linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-64.85 linux-image-4.4.0-64-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-64.85 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-64-generic - 4.4.0-64.85 No subscription required",
