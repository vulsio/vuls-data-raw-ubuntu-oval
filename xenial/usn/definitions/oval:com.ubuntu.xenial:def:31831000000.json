		"description": "Stefan Buehler discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly verified the serial length of OCSP responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain certificate validation measures. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-7444)  Shi Lei discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled certain warning alerts. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause GnuTLS to hang, resulting in a denial of service. This issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-8610)  It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly decoded X.509 certificates with a Proxy Certificate Information extension. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause GnuTLS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2017-5334)  It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled certain OpenPGP certificates. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause GnuTLS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5335, CVE-2017-5336, CVE-2017-5337)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3183-1` to fix the vulnerability.
