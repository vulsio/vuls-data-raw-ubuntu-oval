		"description": "It was discovered that Vim incorrectly handled parsing of filenames in its search functionality. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3973)  It was discovered that Vim incorrectly handled memory when opening and searching the contents of certain files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution with user privileges. (CVE-2021-3974)  It was discovered that Vim incorrectly handled memory when opening and editing certain files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution with user privileges. (CVE-2021-3984, CVE-2021-4019, CVE-2021-4069)  It was discovered that Vim was using freed memory when dealing with regular expressions inside a visual selection. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution with user privileges. (CVE-2021-4192)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing read and write operations when in visual block mode, going beyond the end of a line and causing a heap buffer overflow. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution with user privileges. (CVE-2022-0261, CVE-2022-0318)  It was discovered that Vim was using freed memory when dealing with regular expressions through its old regular expression engine. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution with user privileges. (CVE-2022-1154)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5433-1` to fix the vulnerability.
