		"description": "It was discovered that the RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not did not handle detach operations correctly, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-21008)  Wen Huang discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a heap overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816)  Matt Delco discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking when handling coalesced MMIO write operations. A local attacker with write access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-14821)  Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15117)  Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the Linux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15118)  It was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15505)  Brad Spengler discovered that a Spectre mitigation was improperly implemented in the ptrace susbsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15902)  It was discovered that the SMB networking file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15918)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4162-1` to fix the vulnerability.
