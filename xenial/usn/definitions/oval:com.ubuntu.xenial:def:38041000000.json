		"description": "It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not properly ensure that manifest elements were signed before use. An attacker could possibly use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-3136)  Artem Smotrakov discovered that the HTTP client redirection handler implementation in OpenJDK did not clear potentially sensitive information in HTTP headers when following redirections to different hosts. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3139)  It was discovered that the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) implementation in OpenJDK did not properly enforce restrictions specified by system properties in some situations. An attacker could potentially use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-3149)  It was discovered that the Utility component of OpenJDK did not properly ensure all attributes in a JAR were signed before use. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-3150)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly perform access checks in certain cases when performing field link resolution. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-3169)  Felix Dörre discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) implementation in OpenJDK did not ensure that the same endpoint identification algorithm was used during TLS session resumption as during initial session setup. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3180)  Krzysztof Szafrański discovered that the Scripting component did not properly restrict access to the scripting engine in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-3183)  Tobias Ospelt discovered that the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) reader implementation in OpenJDK contained an infinite loop. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-3214)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3804-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-8-doc - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-jdk - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-source - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-demo - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre-jamvm - 8u181-b13-1ubuntu0.16.04.1 No subscription required",
