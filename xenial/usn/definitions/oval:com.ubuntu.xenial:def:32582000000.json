		"title": "USN-3258-2 -- Dovecot regression",
		"description": "USN-3258-1 intended to fix a vulnerability in Dovecot. Further investigation revealed that only Dovecot versions 2.2.26 and newer were affected by the vulnerability. Additionally, the change introduced a regression when Dovecot was configured to use the \"dict\" authentication database. This update reverts the change. We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Dovecot incorrectly handled some usernames. An attacker  could possibly use this issue to cause Dovecot to hang or crash, resulting in a  denial of service.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3258-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  dovecot-pgsql - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-mysql - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-sieve - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-core - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-ldap - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-sqlite - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-dev - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-pop3d - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-imapd - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-managesieved - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-lucene - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 mail-stack-delivery - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-gssapi - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-lmtpd - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 dovecot-solr - 1:2.2.22-1ubuntu2.4 No subscription required",
