		"description": "It was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled pointer arithmetic in zlib. An attacker could use this issue to cause rsync to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9840, CVE-2016-9841)  It was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled vectors involving left shifts of negative integers in zlib. An attacker could use this issue to cause rsync to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9842)  It was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled vectors involving big-endian CRC calculation in zlib. An attacker could use this issue to cause rsync to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9843)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4292-1` to fix the vulnerability.
