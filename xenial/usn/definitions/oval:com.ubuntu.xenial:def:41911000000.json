		"description": "It was discovered that the LSI SCSI adapter emulator implementation in QEMU did not properly validate executed scripts. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-12068)  Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann and Simon WÃ¶rner discovered that the qxl paravirtual graphics driver implementation in QEMU contained a null pointer dereference. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-12155)  Riccardo Schirone discovered that the QEMU bridge helper did not properly validate network interface names. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass ACL restrictions. (CVE-2019-13164)  It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host. (CVE-2019-14378)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15890)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4191-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  qemu-system-common - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-user-static - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-s390x - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-block-extra - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-kvm - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-user - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-guest-agent - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-utils - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-aarch64 - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-user-binfmt - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-x86 - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-misc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-sparc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-arm - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-ppc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 qemu-system-mips - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42 No subscription required",
