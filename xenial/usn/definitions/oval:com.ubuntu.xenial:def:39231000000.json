		"description": "Michael Hanselmann discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to read or write arbitrary files and cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-16867)  Michael Hanselmann discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to read arbitrary files, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-16872)  Zhibin Hu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Plan 9 File System support. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-19489)  Li Quang and Saar Amar discovered multiple issues in the QEMU PVRDMA device. An attacker inside the guest could use these issues to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.10. These issues were resolved by disabling PVRDMA support in Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-20123, CVE-2018-20124, CVE-2018-20125, CVE-2018-20126, CVE-2018-20191, CVE-2018-20216)  Michael Hanselmann discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain i2c commands. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to read QEMU process memory. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2019-3812)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Slirp networking back-end. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. (CVE-2019-6778)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3923-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  qemu-system-common - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-user-static - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-s390x - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-block-extra - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-kvm - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-user - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-guest-agent - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-utils - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-aarch64 - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-mips - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-user-binfmt - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-x86 - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-arm - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-sparc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-ppc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 qemu-system-misc - 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.36 No subscription required",
