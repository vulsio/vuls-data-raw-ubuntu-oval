With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3137-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-moinmoin - 1.9.8-1ubuntu1.16.04.1 No subscription required",
