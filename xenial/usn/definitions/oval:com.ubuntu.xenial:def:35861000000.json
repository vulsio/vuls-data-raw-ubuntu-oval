		"description": "Konstantin Orekhov discovered that the DHCP server incorrectly handled a large number of concurrent TCP sessions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-2774)  It was discovered that the DHCP server incorrectly handled socket descriptors. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-3144)  Felix Wilhelm discovered that the DHCP client incorrectly handled certain malformed responses. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the DHCP client to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the dhclient AppArmor profile. (CVE-2018-5732)  Felix Wilhelm discovered that the DHCP server incorrectly handled reference counting. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the DHCP server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5733)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3586-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  isc-dhcp-dev - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 isc-dhcp-client-ddns - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 isc-dhcp-relay - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 isc-dhcp-client - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 isc-dhcp-common - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 isc-dhcp-server - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 isc-dhcp-client-udeb - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 isc-dhcp-server-ldap - 4.3.3-5ubuntu12.9 No subscription required",
