		"description": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the cryptography implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-2579)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly validate uses of the invokeinterface JVM instruction. An attacker could possibly use this to access unauthorized resources. (CVE-2018-2582)  It was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK did not properly encode login names. A remote attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-2588)  It was discovered that the DNS client implementation in OpenJDK did not properly randomize source ports. A remote attacker could use this to spoof responses to DNS queries made by Java applications. (CVE-2018-2599)  It was discovered that the Internationalization component of OpenJDK did not restrict search paths when loading resource bundle classes. A local attacker could use this to trick a user into running malicious code. (CVE-2018-2602)  It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict memory allocations when parsing DER input. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-2603)  It was discovered that the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) implementation in OpenJDK in some situations did not guarantee sufficient strength of keys during key agreement. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-2618)  It was discovered that the Java GSS implementation in OpenJDK in some situations did not properly handle GSS contexts in the native GSS library. An attacker could possibly use this to access unauthorized resources. (CVE-2018-2629)  It was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK did not properly handle LDAP referrals in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or gain unauthorized privileges. (CVE-2018-2633)  It was discovered that the Java GSS implementation in OpenJDK in some situations did not properly apply subject credentials. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or gain access to unauthorized resources. (CVE-2018-2634)  It was discovered that the Java Management Extensions (JMX) component of OpenJDK did not properly apply deserialization filters in some situations. An attacker could use this to bypass deserialization restrictions. (CVE-2018-2637)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AWT component of OpenJDK when loading the GTK library. An attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code and escape Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2641)  It was discovered that in some situations OpenJDK did not properly validate objects when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash or excessive memory consumption). (CVE-2018-2663)  It was discovered that the AWT component of OpenJDK did not properly restrict the amount of memory allocated when deserializing some objects. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption). (CVE-2018-2677)  It was discovered that the JNDI component of OpenJDK did not properly restrict the amount of memory allocated when deserializing objects in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption). (CVE-2018-2678)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3613-1` to fix the vulnerability.
