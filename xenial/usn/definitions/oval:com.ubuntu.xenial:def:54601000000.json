		"description": "It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing Vim buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform illegal memory access and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0554)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks for column numbers when replacing tabs with spaces or spaces with tabs, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0572)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing validation of data that contained special multi-byte characters, which could cause an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0685)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing data used to define indentation in a file, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0714)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing certain regular expression patterns and strings, which could cause an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0729)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks when executing spell suggestion commands, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0943)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing bounds checks when processing invalid commands with composing characters in Ex mode, which could cause a buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1616)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing latin1 data when issuing Ex commands, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1619)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing memory management when dealing with invalid regular expression patterns in buffers, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1620)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing invalid bytes when performing spell check operations, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1621)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5460-1` to fix the vulnerability.
