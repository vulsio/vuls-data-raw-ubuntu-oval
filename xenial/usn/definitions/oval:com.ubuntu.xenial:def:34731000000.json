		"description": "It was discovered that the Smart Card IO subsystem in OpenJDK did not properly maintain state. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to a smart card, bypassing sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10274)  Gaston Traberg discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserializations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2017-10281)  It was discovered that the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) component in OpenJDK did not properly handle unreferenced objects. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10285)  It was discovered that the HTTPUrlConnection classes in OpenJDK did not properly handle newlines. An attacker could use this to convince a Java application or applet to inject headers into http requests. (CVE-2017-10295)  Francesco Palmarini, Marco Squarcina, Mauro Tempesta, and Riccardo Focardi discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not properly restrict the amount of memory allocated when deserializing objects from Java Cryptography Extension KeyStore (JCEKS). An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2017-10345)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly perform loader checks when handling the invokespecial JVM instruction. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10346)  Gaston Traberg discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserializations in the SimpleTimeZone class. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2017-10347)  It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserializations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2017-10348, CVE-2017-10357)  It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserializations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2017-10349)  It was discovered that the JAX-WS component in OpenJDK did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserializations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2017-10350)  It was discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK did not properly set timeouts on FTP client actions. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application hang). (CVE-2017-10355)  Francesco Palmarini, Marco Squarcina, Mauro Tempesta, Riccardo Focardi, and Tobias Ospelt discovered that the Security component in OpenJDK did not sufficiently protect password-based encryption keys in key stores. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10356)  Jeffrey Altman discovered that the Kerberos client implementation in OpenJDK incorrectly trusted unauthenticated portions of Kerberos tickets. A remote attacker could use this to impersonate trusted network services or perform other attacks. (CVE-2017-10388)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3473-1` to fix the vulnerability.
