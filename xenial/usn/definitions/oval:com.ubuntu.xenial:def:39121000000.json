		"description": "It was discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library did not properly handle certain BMP images. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted BMP file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3912-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.6 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-common - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.6 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.6 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0-udeb - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.6 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-doc - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.6 gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0 - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.6 No subscription required",
