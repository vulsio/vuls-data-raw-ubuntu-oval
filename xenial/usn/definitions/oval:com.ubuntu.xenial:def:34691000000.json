		"description": "Anthony Perard discovered that the Xen virtual block driver did not properly initialize some data structures before passing them to user space. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2017-10911)  Bo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain requests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)  It was discovered that the nested KVM implementation in the Linux kernel in some situations did not properly prevent second level guests from reading and writing the hardware CR8 register. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).  It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12192)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the sysfs interface for the QLogic 24xx+ series SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14051)  It was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-14156)  Dave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not enforce that the realtime inode flag was settable only on filesystems on a realtime device. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14340)  ChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)  It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data returned to user space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-14991)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Floating Point Unit (fpu) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle attempts to set reserved bits in a task's extended state (xstate) area. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-15537)  Pengfei Wang discovered that the Turtle Beach MultiSound audio device driver in the Linux kernel contained race conditions when fetching from the ring-buffer. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2017-9984, CVE-2017-9985)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3469-1` to fix the vulnerability.
