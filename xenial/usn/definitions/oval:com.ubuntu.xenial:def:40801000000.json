		"description": "Keegan Ryan discovered that the ECC implementation in OpenJDK was not sufficiently resilient to side-channel attacks. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-2745)  It was discovered that OpenJDK did not sufficiently validate serial streams before deserializing suppressed exceptions in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially craft an object that, when deserialized, would cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-2762)  It was discovered that in some situations OpenJDK did not properly bound the amount of memory allocated during object deserialization. An attacker could use this to specially craft an object that, when deserialized, would cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption). (CVE-2019-2769)  It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict privileges in certain situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2019-2786)  Jonathan Birch discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK did not properly validate URLs in some situations. An attacker could use this to bypass restrictions on characters in URLs. (CVE-2019-2816)  Nati Nimni discovered that the Java Cryptography Extension component in OpenJDK did not properly perform array bounds checking in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-2842)  It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted PNG file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenJDK to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-7317)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4080-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-8-doc - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-jdk - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-source - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-demo - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 openjdk-8-jre-jamvm - 8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1 No subscription required",
