		"description": "Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as other releases were fixed in a previous security update. (CVE-2016-2177)  It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle Montgomery multiplication, resulting in incorrect results leading to transient failures. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-7055)  It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time operations when performing ECDSA P-256 signing. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a timing attack and recover private ECDSA keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-7056)  Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain warning alerts. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-8610)  Robert Święcki discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain truncated packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-3731)  It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover private keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2017-3732)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3181-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6 libssl-dev - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6 openssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6 libssl-doc - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6 No subscription required",
