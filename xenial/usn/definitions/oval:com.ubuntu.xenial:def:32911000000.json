		"description": "Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the generic SCSI (sg) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker with access to an sg device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7187)  It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-7261)  Li Qiang discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7294)  It was discovered that an information leak existed in the set_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-7616)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3291-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-78-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-78.99 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-78-generic - 4.4.0-78.99 linux-image-4.4.0-78-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-78.99 linux-image-4.4.0-78-generic - 4.4.0-78.99 linux-image-4.4.0-78-lowlatency - 4.4.0-78.99 linux-image-4.4.0-78-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-78.99 linux-image-4.4.0-78-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-78.99 linux-image-4.4.0-78-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-78.99 No subscription required",
