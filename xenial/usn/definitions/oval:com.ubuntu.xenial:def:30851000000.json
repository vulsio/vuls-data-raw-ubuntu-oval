		"title": "USN-3085-1 -- GDK-PixBuf vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library did not properly handle specially crafted bmp images, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted bmp file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-7552)  It was discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an integer overflow when handling certain images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8875)  Franco Costantini discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an  out-of-bounds write error when parsing an ico file. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted ico file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-6352)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3085-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-common - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0-udeb - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-doc - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.2 gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0 - 2.32.2-1ubuntu1.2 No subscription required",
