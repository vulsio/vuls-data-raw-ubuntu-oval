		"description": "It was discovered that GNU binutils was not properly performing checks when dealing with memory allocation operations, which could lead to excessive memory consumption. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2017-17122, CVE-2017-8421)  It was discovered that GNU binutils was not properly performing bounds checks when processing debug sections with objdump, which could lead to an overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-20671, CVE-2018-6543)  It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a reachable assertion, which could lead to an intentional assertion failure when processing certain crafted DWARF files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-35205)  It was discovered that GNU binutils incorrectly handled memory management operations in several of its functions, which could lead to excessive memory consumption due to memory leaks. An attacker could possibly use these issues to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-47007, CVE-2022-47008, CVE-2022-47010, CVE-2022-47011)  It was discovered that GNU binutils was not properly performing bounds checks when dealing with memory allocation operations, which could lead to excessive memory consumption. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-48063)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6413-1` to fix the vulnerability.
