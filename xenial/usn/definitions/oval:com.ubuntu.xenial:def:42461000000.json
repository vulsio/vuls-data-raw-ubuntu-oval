		"description": "It was discovered that zlib incorrectly handled pointer arithmetic. An attacker could use this issue to cause zlib to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9840, CVE-2016-9841)  It was discovered that zlib incorrectly handled vectors involving left shifts of negative integers. An attacker could use this issue to cause zlib to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9842)  It was discovered that zlib incorrectly handled vectors involving big-endian CRC calculation. An attacker could use this issue to cause zlib to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9843)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4246-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libx32z1-dev - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 lib64z1 - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 libx32z1 - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 zlib1g-udeb - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 lib64z1-dev - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 lib32z1 - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 zlib1g - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 lib32z1-dev - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 zlib1g-dev - 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4.3 No subscription required",
