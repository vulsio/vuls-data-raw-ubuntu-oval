		"description": "It was discovered that FLAC was not properly performing memory management operations, which could result in a memory leak. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause FLAC to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2017-6888)  It was discovered that FLAC was not properly performing bounds checking operations when decoding data. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information or to cause FLAC to crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-0499)  It was discovered that FLAC was not properly performing bounds checking operations when encoding data. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information or to cause FLAC to crash, leading to a denial of service.
