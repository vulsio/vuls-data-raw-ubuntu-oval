		"description": "Kirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-4155)  Lee Jones discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20566)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the SLIP driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-41858)  Tamás Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-42895)  José Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)  It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5884-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1154-aws - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-aws-tools-4.4.0-1154 - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-1154-aws - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-headers-4.4.0-1154-aws - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-tools-4.4.0-1154-aws - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-aws-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1154 - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1154-aws - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-aws-headers-4.4.0-1154 - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-modules-extra-4.4.0-1154-aws - 4.4.0-1154.169 linux-modules-4.4.0-1154-aws - 4.4.0-1154.169 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-modules-extra-aws - 4.4.0.1154.158 linux-aws - 4.4.0.1154.158 linux-tools-aws - 4.4.0.1154.158 linux-headers-aws - 4.4.0.1154.158 linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1154.158 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
