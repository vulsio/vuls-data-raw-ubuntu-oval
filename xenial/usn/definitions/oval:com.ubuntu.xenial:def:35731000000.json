		"description": "It was discovered that a double-free vulnerability existed in the Quagga BGP daemon when processing certain forms of UPDATE message. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5379)  It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon did not properly bounds check the data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10. (CVE-2018-5378)  It was discovered that a table overrun vulnerability existed in the Quagga BGP daemon. An attacker in control of a configured peer could use this to possibly expose sensitive information or possibly cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5380)  It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon in some configurations did not properly handle invalid OPEN messages. An attacker in control of a configured peer could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2018-5381)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3573-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  quagga - 0.99.24.1-2ubuntu1.4 quagga-doc - 0.99.24.1-2ubuntu1.4 No subscription required",
