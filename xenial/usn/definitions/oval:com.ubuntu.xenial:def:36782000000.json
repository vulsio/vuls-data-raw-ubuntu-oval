		"description": "Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that caused a denial of service (system crash) when mounted. (CVE-2018-1092)  It was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the Linux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-8087)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-10021)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3678-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-azure - 4.15.0-1013.13~16.04.2 No subscription required",
