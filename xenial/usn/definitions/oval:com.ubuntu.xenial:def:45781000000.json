		"description": "Hadar Manor discovered that the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled socket reuse, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-16119)  Wen Xu discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inode metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-10322)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when merging free space. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19448)  Jay Shin discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle directory access with broken indexing, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-14314)  Giuseppe Scrivano discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass intended restrictions and gain read access to restricted files. (CVE-2020-16120)  It was discovered that the NFS client implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking before copying security labels in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25212)  It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks when opening raw sockets. A local attacker could use this to create or listen to NFC traffic. (CVE-2020-26088)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4578-1` to fix the vulnerability.
