		"description": "It was discovered that Salt allows remote attackers to determine which files exist on the server. An attacker could use that to extract sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15750)  It was discovered that Salt has a vulnerability that allows an user to bypass authentication. An attacker could use that to extract sensitive information, execute abritrary code or crash the server. (CVE-2018-15751)  It was discovered that Salt is vulnerable to command injection. This allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the API endpoint to execute arbitrary code on the salt-api host. (CVE-2019-17361)  It was discovered that Salt incorrectly validated method calls and sanitized paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to access some methods without authentication. (CVE-2020-11651, CVE-2020-11652)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4459-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  salt-doc - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-minion - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-proxy - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-api - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-syndic - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-ssh - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-common - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-master - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 salt-cloud - 2015.8.8+ds-1ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
