		"description": "It was discovered that YAJL was not properly performing bounds checks when decoding a string with escape sequences. If a user or automated system using YAJL were tricked into processing specially crafted input, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (application abort). (CVE-2017-16516)  It was discovered that YAJL was not properly handling memory allocation when dealing with large inputs, which could lead to heap memory corruption. If a user or automated system using YAJL were tricked into running a specially crafted large input, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-24795)  It was discovered that memory leaks existed in one of the YAJL parsing functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-33460)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6233-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  yajl-tools - 2.1.0-2ubuntu0.16.04.1~esm1 libyajl-doc - 2.1.0-2ubuntu0.16.04.1~esm1 libyajl-dev - 2.1.0-2ubuntu0.16.04.1~esm1 libyajl2 - 2.1.0-2ubuntu0.16.04.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
