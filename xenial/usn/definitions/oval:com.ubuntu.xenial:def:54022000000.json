Original advisory details:   Elison Niven discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the c_rehash  script. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary  commands when c_rehash is run. (CVE-2022-1292)    Aliaksei Levin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled resources when  decoding certificates and keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this  issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, leading to a denial of  service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1473)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5402-2` to fix the vulnerability.
