		"title": "USN-4424-1 -- snapd vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that cloud-init as managed by snapd on Ubuntu Core 16 and Ubuntu Core 18 devices ran on every boot without restrictions. A physical attacker could exploit this to craft cloud-init user-data/meta-data via external media to perform arbitrary changes on the device to bypass intended security mechanisms such as full disk encryption. This issue did not affect traditional Ubuntu systems. (CVE-2020-11933)  It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the XDG_DATA_DIRS  environment variable when calling the system xdg-open. A malicious snap  could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control how the host system xdg-open script opens the URL. This issue did not affect  Ubuntu Core systems. (CVE-2020-11934)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4424-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ubuntu-core-snapd-units - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 ubuntu-core-launcher - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 snap-confine - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 ubuntu-snappy-cli - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 golang-github-snapcore-snapd-dev - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 snapd-xdg-open - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 snapd - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 golang-github-ubuntu-core-snappy-dev - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 ubuntu-snappy - 2.45.1ubuntu0.2 No subscription required",
