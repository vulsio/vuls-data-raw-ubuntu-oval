		"description": "Zygmunt Krynicki discovered that ubuntu-core-launcher did not properly sanitize its input and contained a logic error when determining the mountpoint of bind mounts when using snaps on Ubuntu classic systems (eg, traditional desktop and server). If a user were tricked into installing a malicious snap with a crafted snap name, an attacker could perform a delayed attack to steal data or execute code within the security context of another snap. This issue did not affect Ubuntu Core systems.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2956-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ubuntu-core-launcher - 1.0.27.1 No subscription required",
