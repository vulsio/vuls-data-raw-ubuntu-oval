		"description": "It was discovered that the __get_user_asm_ex implementation in the Linux kernel for x86/x86_64 contained extended asm statements that were incompatible with the exception table. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-9644)  Andreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a setxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group privileges. (CVE-2016-7097)  Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2016-7425)  Daxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2016-8658)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3146-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-51.72 linux-image-4.4.0-51-lowlatency - 4.4.0-51.72 linux-image-4.4.0-51-generic - 4.4.0-51.72 linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-51.72 linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-51.72 linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-51.72 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-51-generic - 4.4.0-51.72 linux-image-4.4.0-51-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-51.72 No subscription required",
