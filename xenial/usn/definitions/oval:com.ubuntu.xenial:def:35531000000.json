		"description": "It was discovered that Ruby failed to validate specification names. An attacker could possibly use a maliciously crafted gem to potentially overwrite any file on the filesystem. (CVE-2017-0901)  It was discovered that Ruby was vulnerable to a DNS hijacking vulnerability. An attacker could use this to possibly force the RubyGems client to download and install gems from a server that the attacker controls. (CVE-2017-0902)  It was discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled certain YAML files. An attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0903)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3553-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~16.04.6 ruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~16.04.6 ruby2.3-dev - 2.3.1-2~16.04.6 ruby2.3-doc - 2.3.1-2~16.04.6 ruby2.3-tcltk - 2.3.1-2~16.04.6 No subscription required",
