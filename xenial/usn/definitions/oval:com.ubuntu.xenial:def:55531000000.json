		"description": "It was discovered that libjpeg-turbo was not properly handling EOF characters, which could lead to excessive memory consumption through the execution of a large loop. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-11813)  It was discovered that libjpeg-turbo was not properly performing bounds check operations, which could lead to a heap-based buffer overread. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-14498)  It was discovered that libjpeg-turbo was not properly limiting the amount of main memory being consumed by the system during decompression or multi-pass compression operations, which could lead to excessive memory consumption. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-14152)  It was discovered that libjpeg-turbo was not properly setting variable sizes when performing certain kinds of encoding operations, which could lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-17541)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5553-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libjpeg-turbo8 - 1.4.2-0ubuntu3.4+esm1 libjpeg-turbo-progs - 1.4.2-0ubuntu3.4+esm1 libjpeg-turbo8-dev - 1.4.2-0ubuntu3.4+esm1 libturbojpeg - 1.4.2-0ubuntu3.4+esm1 libjpeg-turbo-test - 1.4.2-0ubuntu3.4+esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
