		"description": "USN-5079-2 fixed vulnerabilities in curl. One of the fixes introduced a regression. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled upgrades to TLS.  When receiving certain responses from servers, curl would continue without  TLS even when the option to require a successful upgrade to TLS was  specified. (CVE-2021-22946)   Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled responses  received before STARTTLS. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue  to inject responses and intercept communications. (CVE-2021-22947)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5079-4` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 libcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 libcurl4-doc - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 libcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 libcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 curl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19+esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
