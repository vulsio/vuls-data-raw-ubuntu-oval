		"description": "David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL did not correctly prevent buggy applications that ignore handshake errors from subsequently calling certain functions. (CVE-2017-3737)  It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64 Montgomery multiplication procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover private keys. (CVE-2017-3738)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3512-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10 libssl-dev - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10 openssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10 libssl-doc - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10 No subscription required",
