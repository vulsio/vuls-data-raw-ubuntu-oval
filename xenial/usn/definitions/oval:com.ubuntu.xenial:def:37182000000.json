		"title": "USN-3718-2 -- Linux kernel (HWE) regression",
		"description": "USN-3695-2 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux Hardware Enablement Kernel (HWE) kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Unfortunately, the fix for CVE-2018-1108 introduced a regression where insufficient early entropy prevented services from starting, leading in some situations to a failure to boot, This update addresses the issue.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random  seed data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered  sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive  information. (CVE-2018-1108)   Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux  kernel did not properly initialize the crc32c checksum driver. A local  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).  (CVE-2018-1094)   It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an  incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive  information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-10940)   Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux  kernel did not properly validate xattr sizes. A local attacker could use  this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1095)   Jann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for  64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user  space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose  sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-11508)   It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the  floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to  expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-7755)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3718-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-1014-gcp - 4.15.0-1014.14~16.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-azure - 4.15.0-1018.18~16.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-29-generic - 4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-29-generic - 4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-29-lowlatency - 4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-29-lowlatency - 4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-29-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1 No subscription required",
