		"title": "USN-5974-1 -- GraphicsMagick vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly performing bounds checks when processing TGA image files, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted TGA image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-20184)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly validating bits per pixel data when processing DIB image files. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted DIB image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-20189)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly processing bit-field mask values in BMP image files, which could result in the execution of an infinite loop. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted BMP image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-5685)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly validating data used in arithmetic operations when processing MNG image files, which could result in a divide-by-zero error. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted MNG image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-9018)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly performing bounds checks when processing MIFF image files, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted MIFF image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-11006)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick did not properly magnify certain MNG image files, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted MNG image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-12672)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly performing bounds checks when parsing certain MIFF image files, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted MIFF image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1270)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5974-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libgraphics-magick-perl - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 libgraphicsmagick-q16-3 - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 libgraphicsmagick1-dev - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 graphicsmagick - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 libgraphicsmagick++1-dev - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 libgraphicsmagick++-q16-12 - 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.6+esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
