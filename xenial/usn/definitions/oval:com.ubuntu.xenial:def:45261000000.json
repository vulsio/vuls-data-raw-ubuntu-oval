		"description": "It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-18808)  It was discovered that the Conexant 23885 TV card device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19054)  It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19061)  It was discovered that the AMD Audio Coprocessor driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker with the ability to load modules could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19067)  It was discovered that the Atheros HTC based wireless driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074)  It was discovered that the F2FS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-9445)  It was discovered that the VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle attempts to access disabled memory spaces. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12888)  It was discovered that the cgroup v2 subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2020-14356)  It was discovered that the state of network RNG in the Linux kernel was potentially observable. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-16166)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4526-1` to fix the vulnerability.
