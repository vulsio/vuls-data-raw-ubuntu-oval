		"description": "It was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of- bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33655)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle VGA console font changes, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33656)  It was discovered that the Packet network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds access. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-20368)  Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5580-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-extra-4.4.0-1150-aws - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-aws-tools-4.4.0-1150 - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-modules-4.4.0-1150-aws - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-headers-4.4.0-1150-aws - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-1150-aws - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-aws-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1150 - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-aws-headers-4.4.0-1150 - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-image-4.4.0-1150-aws - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-tools-4.4.0-1150-aws - 4.4.0-1150.165 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1150-aws - 4.4.0-1150.165 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-modules-extra-aws - 4.4.0.1150.154 linux-tools-aws - 4.4.0.1150.154 linux-aws - 4.4.0.1150.154 linux-headers-aws - 4.4.0.1150.154 linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1150.154 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
