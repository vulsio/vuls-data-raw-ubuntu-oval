		"description": "It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)  It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell Libertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)  It was discovered that the Fujitsu ES network device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-16231)  It was discovered that the QLogic Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for error, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16233)  Anthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture systems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)  It was discovered that the Mellanox Technologies Innova driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19045)  It was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)  It was discovered that the AMD Display Engine Driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attack could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19083)  It was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input devices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)  It was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability on device disconnect. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19529)  It was discovered that the PEAK-System Technik USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly sanitize memory before sending it to the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19534)  Tristan Madani discovered that the ALSA timer implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19807)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4227-1` to fix the vulnerability.
