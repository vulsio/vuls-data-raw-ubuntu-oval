		"description": "It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1130)  Jann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for 64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-11508)  Wang Qize discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed in the SMBus driver for ACPI Embedded Controllers in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel pointer addresses). (CVE-2018-5750)  It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-5803)  It was discovered that an integer overflow error existed in the futex implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-6927)  It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-7755)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-7757)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3697-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.13.0-1031-oem - 4.13.0-1031.35 No subscription required",
