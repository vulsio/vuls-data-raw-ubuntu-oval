		"description": "It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly handling variables used to perform memory management operations when processing an image through tiffcrop, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25433, CVE-2023-26965)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly processing numerical values when dealing with little-endian input data, which could lead to the execution of an invalid operation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (CVE-2023-26966)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing bounds checks when closing a previously opened TIFF file, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-3316)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6229-1` to fix the vulnerability.
