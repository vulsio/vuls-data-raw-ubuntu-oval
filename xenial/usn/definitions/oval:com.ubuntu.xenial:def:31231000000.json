		"description": "It was discovered that curl incorrectly reused client certificates when built with NSS. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to hijack the authentication of a TLS connection. (CVE-2016-7141)  Nguyen Vu Hoang discovered that curl incorrectly handled escaping certain strings. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-7167)  It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled storing cookies. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject cookies for arbitrary domains in the cookie jar. (CVE-2016-8615)  It was discovered that curl incorrect handled case when comparing user names and passwords. A remote attacker with knowledge of a case-insensitive version of the correct password could possibly use this issue to cause a connection to be reused. (CVE-2016-8616)  It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when encoding to base64. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8617)  It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when preparing formatted output. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8618)  It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when performing Kerberos authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8619)  Luật Nguyễn discovered that curl incorrectly handled parsing globs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-8620)  Luật Nguyễn discovered that curl incorrectly handled converting dates. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-8621)  It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled URL percent-encoding decoding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8622)  It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled shared cookies. A remote server could possibly obtain incorrect cookies or other sensitive information. (CVE-2016-8623)  Fernando Muñoz discovered that curl incorrect parsed certain URLs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to trick curl into connecting to a different host. (CVE-2016-8624)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3123-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 libcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 libcurl4-doc - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 libcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 libcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 curl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2 No subscription required",
