		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: bridge: replace physindev with physinif in nf_bridge_info An skbcan be added to a neigh->arp_queue while waiting for an arp reply. Whereoriginal skb's skb->dev can be different to neigh's neigh->dev. Forinstance in case of bridging dnated skb from one veth to another, the skbwould be added to a neigh->arp_queue of the bridge. As skb->dev can bereset back to nf_bridge->physindev and used, and as there is no explicitmechanism that prevents this physindev from been freed under us (forinstance neigh_flush_dev doesn't cleanup skbs from different device's neighqueue) we can crash on e.g. this stack: arp_process neigh_update skb =__skb_dequeue(&neigh->arp_queue) neigh_resolve_output(..., skb) ...br_nf_dev_xmit br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow skb->dev =nf_bridge->physindev br_handle_frame_finish Let's use plain ifindex insteadof net_device link. To peek into the original net_device we will usedev_get_by_index_rcu(). Thus either we get device and are safe to use it orwe don't get it and drop skb.",
