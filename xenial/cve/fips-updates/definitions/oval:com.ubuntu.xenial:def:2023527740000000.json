		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access Indasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue arecounted. The access to the device queue is unprotected against concurrentaccess. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with alias devices enabled,the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start() is accessing thequeue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic due to incorrectpointer accesses. Fix this by taking the device lock before accessing thequeue and counting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profiledata pointer can be done earlier to avoid unnecessary locking in a hotpath.",
