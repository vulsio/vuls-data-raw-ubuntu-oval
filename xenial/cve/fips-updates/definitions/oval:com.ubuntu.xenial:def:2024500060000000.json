		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to requiresynchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function callingjbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if theEXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In thiscase, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in thejbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggerslockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the samejbd2_handle simultaneously.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller.Rule: add",
