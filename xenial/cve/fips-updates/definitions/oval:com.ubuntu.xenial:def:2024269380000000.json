		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/i915/bios: Tolerate devdata==NULL inintel_bios_encoder_supports_dp_dual_mode() If we have no VBT, or the VBTdidn't declare the encoder in question, we won't have the 'devdata' for theencoder. Instead of oopsing just bail early. We won't be able to tellwhether the port is DP++ or not, but so be it. (cherry picked from commit26410896206342c8a80d2b027923e9ee7d33b733)",
