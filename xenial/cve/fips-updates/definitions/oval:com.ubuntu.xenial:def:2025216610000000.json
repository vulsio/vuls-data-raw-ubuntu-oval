		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpio: virtuser: fix missing lookup table cleanupsWhen a virtuser device is created via configfs and the probe fails dueto an incorrect lookup table, the table is not removed. This preventssubsequent probe attempts from succeeding, even if the issue iscorrected, unless the device is released. Additionally, cleanup is alsoneeded in the less likely case of platform_device_register_full()failure.Besides, a consistent memory leak in lookup_table->dev_id was spottedusing kmemleak by toggling the live state between 0 and 1 with a correctlookup table.Introduce gpio_virtuser_remove_lookup_table() as the counterpart to theexisting gpio_virtuser_make_lookup_table() and call it from allnecessary points to ensure proper cleanup.",
