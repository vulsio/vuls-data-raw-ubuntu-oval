		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix state management in error path of log writing functionAfter commit a694291a6211 (\"nilfs2: separate wait function fromnilfs_segctor_write\") was applied, the log writing functionnilfs_segctor_do_construct() was able to issue I/O requests continuouslyeven if user data blocks were split into multiple logs across segments,but two potential flaws were introduced in its error handling.First, if nilfs_segctor_begin_construction() fails while creating thesecond or subsequent logs, the log writing function returns withoutcalling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction(), so the writeback flag set onpages/folios will remain uncleared.  This causes page cache operations tohang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,truncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() whenan inode is evicted from memory, will hang.Second, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared.As a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that'sfine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes withNILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the \"sc_dirty_files\"list, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,corrupting the block mapping.Fix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()on failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),having it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, andcorrecting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensurethat the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.",
