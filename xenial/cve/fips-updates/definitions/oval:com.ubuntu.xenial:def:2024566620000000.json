		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctlFix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:416 [inline]BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459The issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a bufferthat is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can leadto out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does nothave sufficient space.To address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure thatbuf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg)before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members ofcall_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-56662` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1007-kvm - 4.4.0-1007.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
