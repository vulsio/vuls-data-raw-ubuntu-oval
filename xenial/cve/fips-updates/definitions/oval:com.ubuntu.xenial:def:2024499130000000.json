		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Add null check for top_pipe_to_program incommit_planes_for_streamThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in the`commit_planes_for_stream` function at line 4140. The issue could occurwhen `top_pipe_to_program` is null.The fix adds a check to ensure `top_pipe_to_program` is not null beforeaccessing its stream_res. This prevents a null pointer dereference.Reported by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc.c:4140commit_planes_for_stream() error: we previously assumed'top_pipe_to_program' could be null (see line 3906)",
