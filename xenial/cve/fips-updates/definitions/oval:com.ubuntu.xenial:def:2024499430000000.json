		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/xe/guc_submit: add missing locking in wedged_finiAny non-wedged queue can have a zero refcount here and can be runningconcurrently with an async queue destroy, therefore dereferencing thequeue ptr to check wedge status after the lookup can trigger UAF ifqueue is not wedged.  Fix this by keeping the submission_state lock heldaround the check to postpone the free and make the check safe, beforedropping again around the put() to avoid the deadlock.(cherry picked from commit d28af0b6b9580b9f90c265a7da0315b0ad20bbfd)",
