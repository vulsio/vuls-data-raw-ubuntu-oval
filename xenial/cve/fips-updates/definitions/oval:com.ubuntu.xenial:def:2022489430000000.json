		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86/mmu: make apf token non-zero to fix bugIn current async pagefault logic, when a page is ready, KVM relies onkvm_arch_can_dequeue_async_page_present() to determine whether to delivera READY event to the Guest. This function test token value of structkvm_vcpu_pv_apf_data, which must be reset to zero by Guest kernel when aREADY event is finished by Guest. If value is zero meaning that a READYevent is done, so the KVM can deliver another.But the kvm_arch_setup_async_pf() may produce a valid token with zerovalue, which is confused with previous mention and may lead the loss ofthis READY event.This bug may cause task blocked forever in Guest: INFO: task stress:7532 blocked for more than 1254 seconds.
