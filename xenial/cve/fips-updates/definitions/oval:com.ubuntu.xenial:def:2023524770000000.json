		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:hub: Guard against accesses to uninitialized BOS descriptors Many functionsin drivers/usb/core/hub.c and drivers/usb/core/hub.h access fields insideudev->bos without checking if it was allocated and initialized. Ifusb_get_bos_descriptor() fails for whatever reason, udev->bos will be NULLand those accesses will result in a crash: BUG: kernel NULL pointerdereference, address: 0000000000000018 PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPTSMP NOPTI CPU: 5 PID: 17818 Comm: kworker/5:1 Tainted: G W5.15.108-18910-gab0e1cb584e1 #1 <HASH:1f9e 1> Hardware name: GoogleKindred/Kindred, BIOS Google_Kindred.12672.413.0 02/03/2021 Workqueue:usb_hub_wq hub_event RIP: 0010:hub_port_reset+0x193/0x788 Code: 89 f7 e8 20f7 15 00 48 8b 43 08 80 b8 96 03 00 00 03 75 36 0f b7 88 92 03 00 00 81 f910 03 00 00 72 27 48 8b 80 a8 03 00 00 <48> 83 78 18 00 74 19 48 89 df 488b 75 b0 ba 02 00 00 00 4c 89 e9 RSP: 0018:ffffab740c53fcf8 EFLAGS:00010246 RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa1bc5f678000 RCX: 0000000000000310RDX: fffffffffffffdff RSI: 0000000000000286 RDI: ffffa1be9655b840 RBP:ffffab740c53fd70 R08: 00001b7d5edaa20c R09: ffffffffb005e060 R10:0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 0000000000000000 R13:ffffab740c53fd3e R14: 0000000000000032 R15: 0000000000000000 FS:0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffffa1be96540000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS:0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000000000018 CR3:000000022e80c005 CR4: 00000000003706e0 Call Trace: hub_event+0x73f/0x156e ?hub_activate+0x5b7/0x68f process_one_work+0x1a2/0x487worker_thread+0x11a/0x288 kthread+0x13a/0x152 ?process_one_work+0x487/0x487 ? kthread_associate_blkcg+0x70/0x70ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 Fall back to a default behavior if the BOSdescriptor isn't accessible and skip all the functionalities that depend onit: LPM support checks, Super Speed capabilitiy checks, U1/U2 states setup.",
