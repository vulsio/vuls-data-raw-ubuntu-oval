		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/msm/adreno: Assign msm_gpu->pdev earlier to avoid nullptrsThere are some cases, such as the one uncovered by Commit 46d4efcccc68(\"drm/msm/a6xx: Avoid a nullptr dereference when speedbin setting fails\")wheremsm_gpu_cleanup() : platform_set_drvdata(gpu->pdev, NULL);is called on gpu->pdev == NULL, as the GPU device has not been fullyinitialized yet.Turns out that there's more than just the aforementioned path thatcauses this to happen (e.g. the case when there's speedbin data in thecatalog, but opp-supported-hw is missing in DT).Assigning msm_gpu->pdev earlier seems like the least painful solutionto this, therefore do so.Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/602742/",
