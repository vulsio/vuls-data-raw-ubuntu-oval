		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSD: Limit the number of concurrent async COPY operationsNothing appears to limit the number of concurrent async COPYoperations that clients can start. In addition, AFAICT each asyncCOPY can copy an unlimited number of 4MB chunks, so can run for along time. Thus IMO async COPY can become a DoS vector.Add a restriction mechanism that bounds the number of concurrentbackground COPY operations. Start simple and try to be fair -- thispatch implements a per-namespace limit.An async COPY request that occurs while this limit is exceeded getsNFS4ERR_DELAY. The requesting client can choose to send the requestagain after a delay or fall back to a traditional read/write stylecopy.If there is need to make the mechanism more sophisticated, we canvisit that in future patches.",
