		"description": "An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Watcher search input logged thesearch query results on DEBUG log level. This could lead to raw contents ofdocuments stored in Elasticsearch to be printed in logs. Elastic hasreleased 8.11.2 and 7.17.16 that resolves this issue by removing thisexcessive logging. This issue only affects users that use Watcher and havea Watch defined that uses the search input and additionally have set thesearch input’s logger to DEBUG or finer, for example using:org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input.search,org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher, orwider, since the loggers are hierarchical.",
