		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:liquidio: Adjust a NULL pointer handling path in lio_vf_rep_copy_packetIn lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() pg_info->page is compared to a NULL value,but then it is unconditionally passed to skb_add_rx_frag() which looksstrange and could lead to null pointer dereference.lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() call trace looks like:\tocteon_droq_process_packets\t octeon_droq_fast_process_packets\t  octeon_droq_dispatch_pkt\t   octeon_create_recv_info\t    ...search in the dispatch_list...\t     ->disp_fn(rdisp->rinfo, ...)\t      lio_vf_rep_pkt_recv(struct octeon_recv_info *recv_info, ...)In this path there is no code which sets pg_info->page to NULL.So this check looks unneeded and doesn't solve potential problem.But I guess the author had reason to add a check and I have no such cardand can't do real test.In addition, the code in the function liquidio_push_packet() inliquidio/lio_core.c does exactly the same.Based on this, I consider the most acceptable compromise solution toadjust this issue by moving skb_add_rx_frag() into conditional scope.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39506` to fix the vulnerability.
