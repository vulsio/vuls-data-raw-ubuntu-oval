		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.x.kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation onpointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectremitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.Specifically, for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations, the pointermodification performed by the first operation is not correctly accountedfor when restricting subsequent operations.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29155` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
