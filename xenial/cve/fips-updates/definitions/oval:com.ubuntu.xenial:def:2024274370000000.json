		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/pci: Disable auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQ Currently for devicesrequiring masking at the irqchip for INTx, ie. devices without DisINTxsupport, the IRQ is enabled in request_irq() and subsequently disabled asnecessary to align with the masked status flag. This presents a windowwhere the interrupt could fire between these events, resulting in the IRQincrementing the disable depth twice. This would be unrecoverable for auser since the masked flag prevents nested enables through vfio. Instead,invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive INTx is neverauto-enabled, then unmask as required.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27437` to fix the vulnerability.
