		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync stateFix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filtersbecoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs underheavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLANfilters by setting mac and port VLAN.1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.Reproduction steps:1. Spawn multiple VFs.2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.3. Observe errors in dmesg:\"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,\tplease set promiscuous on manually for VF XX\".Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly butmust be removed using the full process.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53088` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1007-kvm - 4.4.0-1007.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
