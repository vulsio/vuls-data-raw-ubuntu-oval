		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tty:Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit This issue happens when auserspace program does an ioctl FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing thefb_var_screeninfo struct containing only the fields xres, yres, andbits_per_pixel with values. If this struct is the same as the previousioctl, the vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to theupdatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to fbcon_display->vrows, whichmakes the real_y() return a wrong value of y, and that value, eventually,causes the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value. To solve thisissue I made the resize_screen() be called even if the screen does not needany resizing, so it will \"fix and fill\" the fb_var_screeninfoindependently.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47383` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-aws - 4.15.0-1116.123~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-gcp - 4.15.0-1112.126~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-oracle - 4.15.0-1084.92~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
