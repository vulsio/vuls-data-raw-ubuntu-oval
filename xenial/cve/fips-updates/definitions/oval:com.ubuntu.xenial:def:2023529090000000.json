		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix handling of cached open files in nfsd4_open codepathCommit fb70bf124b05 (\"NFSD: Instantiate a struct file when creating aregular NFSv4 file\") added the ability to cache an open fd over acompound. There are a couple of problems with the way this currentlyworks:It's racy, as a newly-created nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bitcleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file pointer is still zeroedout. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see avalid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.Also, there is no guarantee that we'll end up creating a new nfsd_fileif one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the hash with avalid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer withthe value of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.Fix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened variant thattakes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called,we'll take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. Ifthe nfsd_file already has a valid nf_file, we'll just ignore theoptional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.Also rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an \"opened\" variant anddon't try to avoid counting acquisitions in the case where we alreadyhave a cached open file.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52909` to fix the vulnerability.
