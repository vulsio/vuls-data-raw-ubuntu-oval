		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpiolib: fix memory leak in gpiochip_setup_dev()Here is a backtrace report about memory leak detected ingpiochip_setup_dev():unreferenced object 0xffff88810b406400 (size 512):  comm \"python3\", pid 1682, jiffies 4295346908 (age 24.090s)  backtrace:    kmalloc_trace    device_add\t\tdevice_private_init at drivers/base/core.c:3361\t\t\t(inlined by) device_add at drivers/base/core.c:3411    cdev_device_add    gpiolib_cdev_register    gpiochip_setup_dev    gpiochip_add_data_with_keygcdev_register() & gcdev_unregister() would call device_add() &device_del() (no matter CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is enabled or not) toregister/unregister device.However, if device_add() succeeds, some resource (likestruct device_private allocated by device_private_init())is not released by device_del().Therefore, after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register(), itneeds to call put_device() to release resource in the error handlepath.Here we move forward the register of release function, and let itrelease every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().While at it, fix another subtle issue, i.e. when gc->ngpio is equalto 0, we still call kcalloc() and, in case of further error, kfree()on the ZERO_PTR pointer, which is not NULL. It's not a bug per se,but rather waste of the resources and potentially wrong expectationabout contents of the gdev->descs variable.",
