		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: mcp251x: fix deadlock if an interrupt occurs during mcp251x_openThe mcp251x_hw_wake() function is called with the mpc_lock mutex held anddisables the interrupt handler so that no interrupts can be processed whilewaking the device. If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting forthe interrupt handler to complete will deadlock because it will be tryingto acquire the same mutex.CPU0                           CPU1----                           ----mcp251x_open() mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)  request_threaded_irq()                               <interrupt>                               mcp251x_can_ist()                                mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)  mcp251x_hw_wake()   disable_irq() <-- deadlockUse disable_irq_nosync() instead because the interrupt handler doeseverything while holding the mutex so it doesn't matter if it's stillrunning.",
