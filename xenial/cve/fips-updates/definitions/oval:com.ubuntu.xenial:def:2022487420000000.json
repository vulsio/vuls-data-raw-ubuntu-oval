		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: make sure to refresh master_dev/m_ops in __rtnl_newlink() Whilelooking at one unrelated syzbot bug, I found the replay logic in__rtnl_newlink() to potentially trigger use-after-free. It is better toclear master_dev and m_ops inside the loop, in case we have to replay it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48742` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-176-generic - 4.15.0-176.185~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-176-generic - 4.15.0-176.185~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-176-lowlatency - 4.15.0-176.185~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-aws - 4.15.0-1127.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-azure - 4.15.0-1137.150~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-gcp - 4.15.0-1121.135~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1092-oracle - 4.15.0-1092.101~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
