		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/bnxt_re: Avoid CPU lockups due fifo occupancy check loopDriver waits indefinitely for the fifo occupancy to go below a thresholdas soon as the pacing interrupt is received. This can cause soft lockup onone of the processors, if the rate of DB is very high.Add a loop count for FPGA and exit the __wait_for_fifo_occupancy_below_thif the loop is taking more time. Pacing will be continuing until theoccupancy is below the threshold. This is ensured by the checks inbnxt_re_pacing_timer_exp and further scheduling the work for pacing basedon the fifo occupancy.",
