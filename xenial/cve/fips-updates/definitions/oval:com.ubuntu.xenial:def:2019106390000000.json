		"title": "CVE-2019-10639 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allowsInformation Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to aKASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernelimage offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-lessprotocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multipledestination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (ofindices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (viaenumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of astatic variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offsetof the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, bythe attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certainother) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server tosend UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic istrivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For clienttargets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUICcan be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE:this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation waschanged to have a dependency on an address associated with a networknamespace.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10639` to fix the vulnerability.
