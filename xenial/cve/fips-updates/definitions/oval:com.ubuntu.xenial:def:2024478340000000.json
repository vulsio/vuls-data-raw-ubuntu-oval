		"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handlingcomponents. An Use-After-Free read vulnerability has been discoveredaffecting the processing of CodecPrivate elements in Matroska streams. Inthe GST_MATROSKA_ID_CODECPRIVATE case within thegst_matroska_demux_parse_stream function, a data chunk is allocated usinggst_ebml_read_binary. Later, the allocated memory is freed in thegst_matroska_track_free function, by the call to g_free(track->codec_priv). Finally, the freed memory is accessed in thecaps_serialize function through gst_value_serialize_buffer. The freedmemory will be accessed in the gst_value_serialize_buffer function. Thisresults in a UAF read vulnerability, as the function tries to processmemory that has already been freed. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
