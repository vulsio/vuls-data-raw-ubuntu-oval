		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:IB/hfi1: Fix leak of rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr This buffer is currentlyallocated in hfi1_init(): if (reinit) ret = init_after_reset(dd); else ret= loadtime_init(dd); if (ret) goto done; /* allocate dummy tail memory forall receive contexts */ dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr =dma_alloc_coherent(&dd->pcidev->dev, sizeof(u64),&dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_dma, GFP_KERNEL); if (!dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr) {dd_dev_err(dd, \"cannot allocate dummy tail memory\\n\"); ret = -ENOMEM; gotodone; } The reinit triggered path will overwrite the old allocation andleak it. Fix by moving the allocation to hfi1_alloc_devdata() and thedeallocation to hfi1_free_devdata().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47523` to fix the vulnerability.
