		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nft_payload: sanitize offset and length before callingskb_checksum()If access to offset + length is larger than the skbuff length, thenskb_checksum() triggers BUG_ON().skb_checksum() internally subtracts the length parameter while iteratingover skbuff, BUG_ON(len) at the end of it checks that the expectedlength to be included in the checksum calculation is fully consumed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50251` to fix the vulnerability.
