It didn't keepus from continuing to use a buffer that we already had found.In this case we're searching the commit root to cache the block group,so we can start committing the transaction and switch the commit rootand then start writing.  After the switch we can look up an extentbuffer that hasn't been written yet and start processing that blockgroup.  Then we fail to write that block out and clear Uptodate on thepage, and then we start spewing these errors.Normally we're protected by the tree lock to a certain degree here.  Ifwe read a block we have that block read locked, and we block the writerfrom locking the block before we submit it for the write.  However thisisn't necessarily fool proof because the read could happen before we dothe submit_bio and after we locked and unlocked the extent buffer.Also in this particular case we have path->skip_locking set, so thatwon't save us here.  We'll simply get a block that was valid when weread it, but became invalid while we were using it.What we really want is to catch the case where we've \"read\" a block butit's not marked Uptodate.  On read we ClearPageError(), so if we're!Uptodate and !Error we know we didn't do the right thing for readingthe page.Fix this by checking !Uptodate && !Error, this way we will not complainif our buffer gets invalidated while we're using it, and we'll maintainthe spirit of the check which is to make sure we have a fully in-cacheblock while we're messing with it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48902` to fix the vulnerability.
