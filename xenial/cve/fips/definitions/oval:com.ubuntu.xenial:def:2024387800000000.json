		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma-buf/sw-sync: don't enable IRQ from sync_print_obj() Since commita6aa8fca4d79 (\"dma-buf/sw-sync: Reduce irqsave/irqrestore from knowncontext\") by error replaced spin_unlock_irqrestore() with spin_unlock_irq()for both sync_debugfs_show() and sync_print_obj() despite sync_print_obj()is called from sync_debugfs_show(), lockdep complains inconsistent lockstate warning. Use plain spin_{lock,unlock}() for sync_print_obj(), forsync_debugfs_show() is already using spin_{lock,unlock}_irq().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38780` to fix the vulnerability.
