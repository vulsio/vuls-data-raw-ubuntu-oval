		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ceph: fix memory leak in ceph_direct_read_write()The bvecs array which is allocated in iter_get_bvecs_alloc() is leakedand pages remain pinned if ceph_alloc_sparse_ext_map() fails.There is no need to delay the allocation of sparse_ext map until afterthe bvecs array is set up, so fix this by moving sparse_ext allocationa bit earlier.  Also, make a similar adjustment in __ceph_sync_read()for consistency (a leak of the same kind in __ceph_sync_read() has beenaddressed differently).",
