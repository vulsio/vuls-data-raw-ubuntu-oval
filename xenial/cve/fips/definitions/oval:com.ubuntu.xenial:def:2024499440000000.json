		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sctp: set sk_state back to CLOSED if autobind fails in sctp_listen_startIn sctp_listen_start() invoked by sctp_inet_listen(), it should set thesk_state back to CLOSED if sctp_autobind() fails due to whatever reason.Otherwise, next time when calling sctp_inet_listen(), if sctp_sk(sk)->reuseis already set via setsockopt(SCTP_REUSE_PORT), sctp_sk(sk)->bind_hash willbe dereferenced as sk_state is LISTENING, which causes a crash as bind_hashis NULL.
