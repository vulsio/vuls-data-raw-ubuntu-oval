		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: Sync efi page table's kernel mappings before switchingThe EFI page table is initially created as a copy of the kernel page table.With VMAP_STACK enabled, kernel stacks are allocated in the vmalloc area:if the stack is allocated in a new PGD (one that was not present at themoment of the efi page table creation or not synced in a previous vmallocfault), the kernel will take a trap when switching to the efi page tablewhen the vmalloc kernel stack is accessed, resulting in a kernel panic.Fix that by updating the efi kernel mappings before switching to the efipage table.",
