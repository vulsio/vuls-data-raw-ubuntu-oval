		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/rtrs-srv: Avoid null pointer deref during path establishmentFor RTRS path establishment, RTRS client initiates and completes con_numof connections. After establishing all its connections, the informationis exchanged between the client and server through the info_req message.During this exchange, it is essential that all connections have beenestablished, and the state of the RTRS srv path is CONNECTED.So add these sanity checks, to make sure we detect and abort process inerror scenarios to avoid null pointer deref.",
