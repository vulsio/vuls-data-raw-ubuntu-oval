		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3: gadget: Fix NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend Incurrent scenario if Plug-out and Plug-In performed continuously there couldbe a chance while checking for dwc->gadget_driver in dwc3_gadget_suspend, aNULL pointer dereference may occur. Call Stack: CPU1: CPU2:gadget_unbind_driver dwc3_suspend_common dwc3_gadget_stopdwc3_gadget_suspend dwc3_disconnect_gadget CPU1 basically clears thevariable and CPU2 checks the variable. Consider CPU1 is running and rightbefore gadget_driver is cleared and in parallel CPU2 executesdwc3_gadget_suspend where it finds dwc->gadget_driver which is not NULL andresumes execution and then CPU1 completes execution. CPU2 executesdwc3_disconnect_gadget where it checks dwc->gadget_driver is already NULLbecause of which the NULL pointer deference occur.",
