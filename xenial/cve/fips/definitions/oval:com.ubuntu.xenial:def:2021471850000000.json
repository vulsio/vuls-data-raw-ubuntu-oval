		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tty:tty_buffer: Fix the softlockup issue in flush_to_ldisc When running ltptestcase(ltp/testcases/kernel/pty/pty04.c) with arm64, there is a softlockup, which look like this one: Workqueue: events_unbound flush_to_ldiscCall trace: dump_backtrace+0x0/0x1ec show_stack+0x24/0x30dump_stack+0xd0/0x128 panic+0x15c/0x374 watchdog_timer_fn+0x2b8/0x304__run_hrtimer+0x88/0x2c0 __hrtimer_run_queues+0xa4/0x120hrtimer_interrupt+0xfc/0x270 arch_timer_handler_phys+0x40/0x50handle_percpu_devid_irq+0x94/0x220 __handle_domain_irq+0x88/0xf0gic_handle_irq+0x84/0xfc el1_irq+0xc8/0x180 slip_unesc+0x80/0x214 [slip]tty_ldisc_receive_buf+0x64/0x80 tty_port_default_receive_buf+0x50/0x90flush_to_ldisc+0xbc/0x110 process_one_work+0x1d4/0x4b0worker_thread+0x180/0x430 kthread+0x11c/0x120 In the testcase pty04, Thefirst process call the write syscall to send data to the pty master. At thesame time, the workqueue will do the flush_to_ldisc to pop data in a loopuntil there is no more data left. When the sender and workqueue running indifferent core, the sender sends data fastly in full time which will resultin workqueue doing work in loop for a long time and occuring softlockup inflush_to_ldisc with kernel configured without preempt. So I addneed_resched check and cond_resched in the flush_to_ldisc loop to avoid it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47185` to fix the vulnerability.
