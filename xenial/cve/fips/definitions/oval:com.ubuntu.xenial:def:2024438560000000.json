		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma: fix call order in dmam_free_coherentdmam_free_coherent() frees a DMA allocation, which makes thefreed vaddr available for reuse, then calls devres_destroy()to remove and free the data structure used to track the DMAallocation. Between the two calls, it is possible for aconcurrent task to make an allocation with the same vaddrand add it to the devres list.If this happens, there will be two entries in the devres listwith the same vaddr and devres_destroy() can free the wrongentry, triggering the WARN_ON() in dmam_match.Fix by destroying the devres entry before freeing the DMAallocation.  kokonut //net/encryption    http://sponge2/b9145fe6-0f72-4325-ac2f-a84d81075b03",
