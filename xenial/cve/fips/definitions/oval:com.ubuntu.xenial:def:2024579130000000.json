		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: f_fs: Remove WARN_ON in functionfs_bindThis commit addresses an issue related to below kernel panic wherepanic_on_warn is enabled. It is caused by the unnecessary use of WARN_ONin functionsfs_bind, which easily leads to the following scenarios.1.adb_write in adbd               2.

In this race scenario, the kernel panicoccurs due to the WARN_ON from functionfs_bind when panic_on_warn isenabled. This commit fixes the kernel panic by removing the unnecessaryWARN_ON.Kernel panic - not syncing: kernel: panic_on_warn set ...[   14.542395] Call trace:[   14.542464]  ffs_func_bind+0x1c8/0x14a8[   14.542468]  usb_add_function+0xcc/0x1f0[   14.542473]  configfs_composite_bind+0x468/0x588[   14.542478]  gadget_bind_driver+0x108/0x27c[   14.542483]  really_probe+0x190/0x374[   14.542488]  __driver_probe_device+0xa0/0x12c[   14.542492]  driver_probe_device+0x3c/0x220[   14.542498]  __driver_attach+0x11c/0x1fc[   14.542502]  bus_for_each_dev+0x104/0x160[   14.542506]  driver_attach+0x24/0x34[   14.542510]  bus_add_driver+0x154/0x270[   14.542514]  driver_register+0x68/0x104[   14.542518]  usb_gadget_register_driver_owner+0x48/0xf4[   14.542523]  gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store+0xf8/0x144[   14.542526]  configfs_write_iter+0xf0/0x138",
