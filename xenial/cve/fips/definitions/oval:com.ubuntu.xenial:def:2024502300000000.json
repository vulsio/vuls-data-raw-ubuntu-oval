		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flagSyzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detectsfilesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, mayfail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,triggering a kernel bug.This was found to be because the \"checked\" flag of a page/folio was notcleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes thesanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directorypage/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine wasapplied to more than just metadata files.",
