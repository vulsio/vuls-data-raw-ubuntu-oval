		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDsiw_conn_req_handler() associates a new struct rdma_id_private (conn_id)withan existing struct iw_cm_id (cm_id) as follows:        conn_id->cm_id.iw = cm_id;        cm_id->context = conn_id;        cm_id->cm_handler = cma_iw_handler;rdma_destroy_id() frees both the cm_id and the struct rdma_id_private. Makesure that cm_work_handler() does not trigger a use-after-free by onlyfreeing of the struct rdma_id_private after all pending work has finished.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42285` to fix the vulnerability.
