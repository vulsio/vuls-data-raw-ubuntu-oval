		"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handlingcomponents. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to bystream->samples to accommodate stream->n_samples + samples_count elementsof type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from theinput file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integeroverflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocatememory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended.Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements andattempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceedingthe actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. Thisvulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
