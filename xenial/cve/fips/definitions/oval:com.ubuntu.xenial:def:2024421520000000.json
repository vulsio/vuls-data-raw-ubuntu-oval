		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvmet: fix a possible leak when destroy a ctrl during qp establishmentIn nvmet_sq_destroy we capture sq->ctrl early and if it is non-NULL weknow that a ctrl was allocated (in the admin connect request handler)and we need to release pending AERs, clear ctrl->sqs and sq->ctrl(for nvme-loop primarily), and drop the final reference on the ctrl.However, a small window is possible where nvmet_sq_destroy starts (asa result of the client giving up and disconnecting) concurrently withthe nvme admin connect cmd (which may be in an early stage). But *before*kill_and_confirm of sq->ref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sqlive reference). In this case, sq->ctrl was allocated however after it wascaptured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy.This prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.Solve this by re-capturing the sq->ctrl after all inflight request hascompleted, where for sure sq->ctrl reference is final, and move forwardbased on that.This issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connectingmultiple ctrls simoutanuosly, creating a delay in allocating a ctrlleading up to this race window.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42152` to fix the vulnerability.
