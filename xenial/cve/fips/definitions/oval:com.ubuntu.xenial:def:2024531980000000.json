		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen: Fix the issue of resource not being properly released inxenbus_dev_probe()This patch fixes an issue in the function xenbus_dev_probe(). In thexenbus_dev_probe() function, within the if (err) branch at line 313, theprogram incorrectly returns err directly without releasing the resourcesallocated by err = drv->probe(dev, id). As the return value is non-zero,the upper layers assume the processing logic has failed. However, the probeoperation was performed earlier without a corresponding remove operation.Since the probe actually allocates resources, failing to perform the removeoperation could lead to problems.To fix this issue, we followed the resource release logic of thexenbus_dev_remove() function by adding a new block fail_remove before thefail_put block. After entering the branch if (err) at line 313, thefunction will use a goto statement to jump to the fail_remove block,ensuring that the previously acquired resources are correctly released,thus preventing the reference count leak.This bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developedby our team. The tool specializes in analyzing reference count operationsand detecting potential issues where resources are not properly managed.In this case, the tool flagged the missing release operation as apotential problem, which led to the development of this patch.",
