		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: fec: don't save PTP state if PTP is unsupportedSome platforms (such as i.MX25 and i.MX27) do not support PTP, so onthese platforms fec_ptp_init() is not called and the related membersin fep are not initialized. However, fec_ptp_save_state() is calledunconditionally, which causes the kernel to panic. Therefore, add acondition so that fec_ptp_save_state() is not called if PTP is notsupported.",
