		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the listAt insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existingref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head'sref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list membernot reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of thelist to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which canhappen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transactionabort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we calllist_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false sincethe list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequencewe call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in aninvalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poisonpointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED andCONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferencesotherwise.So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50273` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1004-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
