		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Fix PCI device refcount leak in dmar_dev_scope_init()for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device(). The comment ofpci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for thereturned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the inputpci_dev @from if it is not NULL.If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to callpci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. Add the missingpci_dev_put() for the error path to avoid reference count leak.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-49002` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
