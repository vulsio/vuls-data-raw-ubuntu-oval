		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: protect folio::private when attaching extent buffer folios[BUG]Since v6.8 there are rare kernel crashes reported by various people,the common factor is bad page status error messages like this:  BUG: Bad page state in process kswapd0  pfn:d6e840  page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:000000007512f4f2 index:0x2796c2c7c  pfn:0xd6e840  aops:btree_aops ino:1  flags: 0x17ffffe0000008(uptodate|node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0x3fffff)  page_type: 0xffffffff()  raw: 0017ffffe0000008 dead000000000100 dead000000000122 ffff88826d0be4c0  raw: 00000002796c2c7c 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000  page dumped because: non-NULL mapping[CAUSE]Commit 09e6cef19c9f (\"btrfs: refactor alloc_extent_buffer() toallocate-then-attach method\") changes the sequence when allocating a newextent buffer.Previously we always called grab_extent_buffer() undermapping->i_private_lock, to ensure the safety on modification onfolio::private (which is a pointer to extent buffer for regularsectorsize).This can lead to the following race:Thread A is trying to allocate an extent buffer at bytenr X, with 44K pages, meanwhile thread B is trying to release the page at X + 4K(the second page of the extent buffer at X).
