		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix incorrect page refcountingThe kTLS tx handling code is using a mix of get_page() andpage_ref_inc() APIs to increment the page reference. But on the releasepath (mlx5e_ktls_tx_handle_resync_dump_comp()), only put_page() is used.This is an issue when using pages from large folios: the get_page()references are stored on the folio page while the page_ref_inc()references are stored directly in the given page. On release the foliopage will be dereferenced too many times.This was found while doing kTLS testing with sendfile() + ZC when theserved file was read from NFS on a kernel with NFS large folios support(commit 49b29a573da8 (\"nfs: add support for large folios\")).",
