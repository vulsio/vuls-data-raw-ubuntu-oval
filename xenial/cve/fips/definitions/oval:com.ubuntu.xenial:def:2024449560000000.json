		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/xe/preempt_fence: enlarge the fence critical sectionIt is really easy to introduce subtle deadlocks inpreempt_fence_work_func() since we operate on single global ordered-wqfor signalling our preempt fences behind the scenes, so even though wesignal a particular fence, everything in the callback should be in thefence critical section, since blocking in the callback will preventother published fences from signalling. If we enlarge the fence criticalsection to cover the entire callback, then lockdep should be able tounderstand this better, and complain if we grab a sensitive lock likevm->lock, which is also held when waiting on preempt fences.",
