		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP In commit 510410bfc034(\"drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object function\") we switched to anew/cleaner method of doing things. That's good, but we missed a littlebit. Before that commit, we used to _first_ run through thedrm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj->funcs->mmap()` was NULL. That meantthat we ran: vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND |VM_DONTDUMP; vma->vm_page_prot =pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags)); vma->vm_page_prot =pgprot_decrypted(vma->vm_page_prot); ...and _then_ we modified thosemappings with our own. Now that `obj->funcs->mmap()` is no longer NULL wedon't run the default code. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags gotVM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP was important because we're now getting crashes onChromebooks that use ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash thatlooks like this (this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but alsoseen on a 5.15 kernel): Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtualaddress ffffffc008000000 Mem abort info: ESR = 0x96000006 EC = 0x25: DABT(current EL), IL = 32 bits SET = 0, FnV = 0 EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 Data abortinfo: ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000006 CM = 0, WnR = 0 swapper pgtable: 4k pages,39-bit VAs, pgdp=000000008293d000 [ffffffc008000000] pgd=00000001002b3003,p4d=00000001002b3003, pud=00000001002b3003, pmd=0000000000000000 Internalerror: Oops: 96000006 [#1] PREEMPT SMP [...] CPU: 7 PID: 15734 Comm:crash_dump64 Tainted: G W 5.10.67 #1 [...] Hardware name: QualcommTechnologies, Inc. sc7280 IDP SKU2 platform (DT) pstate: 80400009 (Nzcvdaif +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--) pc : __arch_copy_to_user+0xc0/0x30c lr :copyout+0xac/0x14c [...] Call trace: __arch_copy_to_user+0xc0/0x30ccopy_page_to_iter+0x1a0/0x294 process_vm_rw_core+0x240/0x408process_vm_rw+0x110/0x16c __arm64_sys_process_vm_readv+0x30/0x3cel0_svc_common+0xf8/0x250 do_el0_svc+0x30/0x80 el0_svc+0x10/0x1cel0_sync_handler+0x78/0x108 el0_sync+0x184/0x1c0 Code: f8408423 f80008c3910020c6 36100082 (b8404423) Let's add the two flags back in. While we'reat it, the fact that we aren't running the default means that we _don't_need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save an instruction. NOTE:it was confirmed that VM_IO was the important flag to fix the problem I wasseeing, but adding back VM_DONTDUMP seems like a sane thing to do so I'mdoing that too.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47531` to fix the vulnerability.
