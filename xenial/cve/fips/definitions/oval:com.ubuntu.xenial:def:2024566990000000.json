		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/pci: Fix potential double remove of hotplug slotIn commit 6ee600bfbe0f (\"s390/pci: remove hotplug slot when releasing thedevice\") the zpci_exit_slot() was moved from zpci_device_reserved() tozpci_release_device() with the intention of keeping the hotplug slotaround until the device is actually removed.Now zpci_release_device() is only called once all references aredropped. Since the zPCI subsystem only drops its reference once thedevice is in the reserved state it follows that zpci_release_device()must only deal with devices in the reserved state. Despite that itcontains code to tear down from both configured and standby state. Forthe standby case this already includes the removal of the hotplug slotso would cause a double removal if a device was ever removed ineither configured or standby state.Instead of causing a potential double removal in a case that shouldnever happen explicitly WARN_ON() if a device in non-reserved state isreleased and get rid of the dead code cases.",
