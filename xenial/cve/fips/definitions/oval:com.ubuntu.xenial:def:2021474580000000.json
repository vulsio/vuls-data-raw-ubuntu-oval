		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ocfs2:mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen Starting with kernel 5.11 builtwith CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE mouting an ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb orpcmk cluster stack fails with the trace below. Problem seems to be thatstrings for cluster stack and cluster name are not guaranteed to be nullterminated in the disk representation, while strlcpy assumes that thesource string is always null terminated. This causes a read outside of thesource string triggering the buffer overflow detection. detected bufferoverflow in strlen ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG atlib/string.c:1149! invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI CPU: 1 PID: 910 Comm:mount.ocfs2 Not tainted 5.14.0-1-amd64 #1 Debian 5.14.6-2 RIP:0010:fortify_panic+0xf/0x11 ...
