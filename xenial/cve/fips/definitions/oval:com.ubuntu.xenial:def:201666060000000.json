		"description": "An issue was discovered in cookie encryption in phpMyAdmin. The decryptionof the username/password is vulnerable to a padding oracle attack. This canallow an attacker who has access to a user's browser cookie file to decryptthe username and password. Furthermore, the same initialization vector (IV)is used to hash the username and password stored in the phpMyAdmin cookie.If a user has the same password as their username, an attacker who examinesthe browser cookie can see that they are the same - but the attacker cannot directly decode these values from the cookie as it is still hashed. All4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-6606` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpmyadmin - 4:4.5.4.1-2ubuntu2.1\nNo subscription required",
