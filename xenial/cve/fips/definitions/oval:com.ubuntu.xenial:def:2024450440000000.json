		"description": "Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of datafor operating systems. When a command ACL is in place and a user executes acommand in bconsole using an abbreviation (i.e. \"w\" for \"whoami\") the ACLcheck did not apply to the full form (i.e. \"whoami\") but to the abbreviatedform (i.e. \"w\"). If the command ACL is configured with negative ACL thatshould forbid using the \"whoami\" command, you could still use \"w\" or \"who\"as a command successfully. Fixes for the problem are shipped in Bareosversions 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11. If only positive command ACLs are usedwithout any negation, the problem does not occur.",
