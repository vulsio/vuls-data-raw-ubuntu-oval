		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/damon/sysfs: fix wrong empty schemes assumption under online tuning indamon_sysfs_set_schemes()Commit da87878010e5 (\"mm/damon/sysfs: support online inputs update\") made'damon_sysfs_set_schemes()' to be called for running DAMON context, whichcould have schemes.  In the case, DAMON sysfs interface is supposed toupdate, remove, or add schemes to reflect the sysfs files.  However, thecode is assuming the DAMON context wouldn't have schemes at all, andtherefore creates and adds new schemes.  As a result, the code doesn'twork as intended for online schemes tuning and could have more thanexpected memory footprint.  The schemes are all in the DAMON context, soit doesn't leak the memory, though.Remove the wrong asssumption (the DAMON context wouldn't have schemes) in'damon_sysfs_set_schemes()' to fix the bug.",
