		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:IB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive ListThe existing behavior of ib_umad, which maintains received MADpackets in an unbounded list, poses a risk of uncontrolled growth.As user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rateof extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets, leadingto potential list overflow.To address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. Afterconsidering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which canhandle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retrytimeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packetsreceived beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timedout by the time they are handled by user-space.Notably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons liketimed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full.",
