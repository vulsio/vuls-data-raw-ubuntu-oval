		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:CDC-NCM: avoid overflow in sanity checkingA broken device may give an extreme offset like 0xFFF0and a reasonable length for a fragment. In the sanitycheck as formulated now, this will create an integeroverflow, defeating the sanity check. Both offsetand offset + len need to be checked in such a mannerthat no overflow can occur.And those quantities should be unsigned.",
