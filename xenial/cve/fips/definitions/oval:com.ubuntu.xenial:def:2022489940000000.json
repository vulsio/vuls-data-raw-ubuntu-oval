		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: seq: Fix function prototype mismatch in snd_seq_expand_var_eventWith clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),indirect call targets are validated against the expected functionpointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigateROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.seq_copy_in_user() and seq_copy_in_kernel() did not have prototypesmatching snd_seq_dump_func_t. Adjust this and remove the casts. Thereare not resulting binary output differences.This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strictflag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,which only checks for type width mismatches.",
