There are tworeasons for this: first, the parameter value passed is greater thanocfs2_max_inline_data_with_xattr, second, the start and end parameters ofocfs2_truncate_inline are \"unsigned int\".So, we need to add a sanity check for byte_start and byte_len right beforeocfs2_truncate_inline() in ocfs2_remove_inode_range(), if they are greaterthan ocfs2_max_inline_data_with_xattr return -EINVAL.",
