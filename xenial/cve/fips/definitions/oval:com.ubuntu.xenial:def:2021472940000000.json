		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netrom:Decrease sock refcount when sock timers expire Commit 63346650c1a9(\"netrom: switch to sock timer API\") switched to use sock timer API. Itreplaces mod_timer() by sk_reset_timer(), and del_timer() bysk_stop_timer(). Function sk_reset_timer() will increase the refcount ofsock if it is called on an inactive timer, hence, in case the timerexpires, we need to decrease the refcount ourselves in the handler,otherwise, the sock refcount will be unbalanced and the sock will never befreed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47294` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-lowlatency - 4.15.0-159.167~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-aws - 4.15.0-1112.119~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-gcp - 4.15.0-1109.123~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-oracle - 4.15.0-1081.89~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
