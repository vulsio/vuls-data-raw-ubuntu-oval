		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flagSyzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system imageand degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flagin submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing thebuffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fixthis.This became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routinewas expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the bufferis written normally by log writing.",
