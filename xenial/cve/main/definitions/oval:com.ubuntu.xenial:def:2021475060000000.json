		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfsd:fix use-after-free due to delegation race A delegation break could arriveas soon as we've called vfs_setlease. A delegation break runs a callbackwhich immediately (in nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation todel_recall_lru. If we then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing thedelegation, it will be freed as soon as the callback is done with it,without ever being removed from del_recall_lru. Symptoms show up later asuse-after-free or list corruption warnings, usually in the laundromatthread. I suspect aba2072f4523 \"nfsd: grant read delegations to clientsholding writes\" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back asv3.0 and it looks to me it already had the same problem. So I'm not surewhere the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47506` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-aws - 4.15.0-1120.128~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-gcp - 4.15.0-1116.130~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-oracle - 4.15.0-1087.95~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
