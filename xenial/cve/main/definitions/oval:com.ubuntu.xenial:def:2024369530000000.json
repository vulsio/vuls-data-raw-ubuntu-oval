		"title": "CVE-2024-36953 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: vgic-v2: Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr()vgic_v2_parse_attr() is responsible for finding the vCPU that matches theuser-provided CPUID, which (of course) may not be valid. If the ID isinvalid, kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() returns NULL, which isn't handled gracefully.Similar to the GICv3 uaccess flow, check that kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() actuallyreturns something and fail the ioctl if not.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36953` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1004-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nNo subscription required",
