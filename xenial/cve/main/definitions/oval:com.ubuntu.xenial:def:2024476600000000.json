		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazilyIn some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries.Hence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take asignificant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happensunder inode->i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lockwhen we remove the watch from the directory as the__fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask()races with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from__fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockupreports reported by users.Fix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() toset PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children.When parent stops watching children, clear false positive PARENT_WATCHEDflags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child.",
