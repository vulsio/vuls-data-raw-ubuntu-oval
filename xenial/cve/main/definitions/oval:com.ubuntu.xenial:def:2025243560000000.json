		"title": "CVE-2025-24356 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "fastd is a VPN daemon which tunnels IP packets and Ethernet frames overUDP. When receiving a data packet from an unknown IP address/portcombination, fastd will assume that one of its connected peers has moved toa new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake packet. This\"fast reconnect\" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s)until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet justcontaining the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshakepacket (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, theresulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13. By sending data packetswith a spoofed source address to fastd instances reachable on the internet,this amplification of UDP traffic might be used to facilitate a DistributedDenial of Service attack. This vulnerability is fixed in v23.",
