		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Avoid overflow assignment in link_dp_ctssampling_rate is an uint8_t but is assigned an unsigned int, and thus itcan overflow. As a result, sampling_rate is changed to uint32_t.Similarly, LINK_QUAL_PATTERN_SET has a size of 2 bits, and it shouldonly be assigned to a value less or equal than 4.This fixes 2 INTEGER_OVERFLOW issues reported by Coverity.",
