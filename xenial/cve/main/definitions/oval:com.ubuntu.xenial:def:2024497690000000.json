		"description": "Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. Whena remote client closes the connection before waitress has had theopportunity to call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up theconnection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket thatno longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attemptto process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remoteattacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very littleresources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the racecondition.",
