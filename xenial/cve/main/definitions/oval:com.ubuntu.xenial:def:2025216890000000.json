		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due toan incorrect bounds check in the following:       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {               dev_err(&port->dev,                       \"%s - port change to invalid port: %i\\n\",                       __func__, newport);               break;       }The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->portbuffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equalto serial->num_ports, the assignment of \"port\" in thefollowing code is out-of-bounds and NULL:       serial_priv->current_port = newport;       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_portsindicating it is out-of-bounds.",
