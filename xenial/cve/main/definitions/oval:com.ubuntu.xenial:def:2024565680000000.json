		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device boundNull pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmudriver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driverprobe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driverhas been called.Following is how the race occurs:T1:Smmu device probe\t\tT2: Client device probereally_probe()arm_smmu_device_probe()iommu_device_register()\t\t\t\t\treally_probe()\t\t\t\t\tplatform_dma_configure()\t\t\t\t\tof_dma_configure()\t\t\t\t\tof_dma_configure_id()\t\t\t\t\tof_iommu_configure()\t\t\t\t\tiommu_probe_device()\t\t\t\t\tiommu_init_device()\t\t\t\t\tarm_smmu_probe_device()\t\t\t\t\tarm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()\t\t\t\t\t\tdriver_find_device_by_fwnode()\t\t\t\t\t\tdriver_find_device()\t\t\t\t\t\tnext_device()\t\t\t\t\t\tklist_next()\t\t\t\t\t\t    /* null ptr\t\t\t\t\t\t       assigned to smmu */\t\t\t\t\t/* null ptr dereference\t\t\t\t\t   while smmu->streamid_mask */driver_bound()\tklist_add_tail()When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later inarm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.Fix this by deferring the probe of the client deviceuntil the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.[will: Add comment]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-56568` to fix the vulnerability.
