If the task is boosted, the warningis triggered. A boosted task already had its parameters set byrt_mutex_setprio, and a new call to setup_new_dl_entity is unnecessary,hence the WARN_ON call.Check if we are requeueing a boosted task and avoid callingsetup_new_dl_entity if that's the case.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-56583` to fix the vulnerability.
