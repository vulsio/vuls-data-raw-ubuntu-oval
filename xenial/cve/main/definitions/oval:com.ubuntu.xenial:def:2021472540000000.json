		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: gfs2:Fix use-after-free in gfs2_glock_shrink_scan The GLF_LRU flag is checkedunder lru_lock in gfs2_glock_remove_from_lru() to remove the glock from thelru list in __gfs2_glock_put(). On the shrink scan path, the same flag iscleared under lru_lock but because of cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) ingfs2_dispose_glock_lru(), progress on the put side can be made withoutdeleting the glock from the lru list. Keep GLF_LRU across the race windowopened by cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) to ensure correct behavior on bothsides - clear GLF_LRU after list_del under lru_lock.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47254` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
