		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i3c: mipi-i3c-hci: Mask ring interrupts before ring stop requestBus cleanup path in DMA mode may trigger a RING_OP_STAT interrupt whenthe ring is being stopped. Depending on timing between ring stop requestcompletion, interrupt handler removal and code execution this may leadto a NULL pointer dereference in hci_dma_irq_handler() if it gets to runafter the io_data pointer is set to NULL in hci_dma_cleanup().Prevent this my masking the ring interrupts before ring stop request.",
