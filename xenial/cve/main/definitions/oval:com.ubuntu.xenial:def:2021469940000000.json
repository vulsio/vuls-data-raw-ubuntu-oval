		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: can:mcp251x: fix resume from sleep before interface was brought up Since8ce8c0abcba3 the driver queues work via priv->restart_work when resumingafter suspend, even when the interface was not previously enabled. Thiscauses a null dereference error as the workqueue is only allocated andinitialized in mcp251x_open(). To fix this we move the workqueue init tomcp251x_can_probe() as there is no reason to do it later and repeat itwhenever mcp251x_open() is called.
