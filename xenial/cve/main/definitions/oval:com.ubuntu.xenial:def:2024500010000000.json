		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Fix error path in multi-packet WQE transmitRemove the erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was establishedThe multi-packet WQE transmit code attempts to obtain a DMA mapping forthe skb. This could fail, e.g. under memory pressure, when the IOMMUdriver just can't allocate more memory for page tables. While the codetries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneouslyunmaps one entry from the sq's FIFO list of active mappings. Since thecurrent map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mappingthat might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA,the IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCIfunction in error state.The erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that createdmemory pressure.",
