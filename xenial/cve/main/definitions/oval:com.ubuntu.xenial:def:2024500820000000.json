Analyzing the coredump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and movedon to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previouslydata->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage indata->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting thewaitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is findingthat it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()==============================================================prepare_to_wait_exclusive()                                        data->got_token = true;                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);if (data.got_token)        break;finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);  ^- returns immediately because     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)     is true... return, go do something else ...                                        wake_up_process(data->task)                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueueentry has already been removed from the waitqueue.The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entryAFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiterand THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to uselist_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() infinish_wait().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50082` to fix the vulnerability.
