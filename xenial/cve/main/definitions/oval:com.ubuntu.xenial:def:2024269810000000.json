		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix OOB in nilfs_set_de_type The size of the nilfs_type_by_mode array inthe fs/nilfs2/dir.c file is defined as \"S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT\", but thenilfs_set_de_type() function, which uses this array, specifies the index toread from the array in the same way as \"(mode & S_IFMT) >> S_SHIFT\". staticvoid nilfs_set_de_type(struct nilfs_dir_entry *de, struct inode *inode) {umode_t mode = inode->i_mode; de->file_type = nilfs_type_by_mode[(mode &S_IFMT)>>S_SHIFT]; // oob } However, when the index is determined this way,an out-of-bounds (OOB) error occurs by referring to an index that is 1larger than the array size when the condition \"mode & S_IFMT == S_IFMT\" issatisfied. Therefore, a patch to resize the nilfs_type_by_mode array shouldbe applied to prevent OOB errors.",
