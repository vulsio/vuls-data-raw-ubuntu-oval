		"title": "CVE-2021-34866 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges onaffected installations of Linux Kernel 5.14-rc3. An attacker must firstobtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system inorder to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within thehandling of eBPF programs. The issue results from the lack of propervalidation of user-supplied eBPF programs, which can result in a typeconfusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability toescalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of thekernel.
