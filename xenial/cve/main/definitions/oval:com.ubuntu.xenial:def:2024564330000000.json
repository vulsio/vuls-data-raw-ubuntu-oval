		"description": "shadow-utils (aka shadow) 4.4 through 4.17.0 establishes a default/etc/subuid behavior (e.g., uid 100000 through 165535 for the first useraccount) that can realistically conflict with the uids of users defined onlocally administered networks, potentially leading to account takeover,e.g., by leveraging newuidmap for access to an NFS home directory (orsame-host resources in the case of remote logins by these local networkusers). NOTE: it may also be argued that system administrators should nothave assigned uids, within local networks, that are within the range thatcan occur in /etc/subuid.",
