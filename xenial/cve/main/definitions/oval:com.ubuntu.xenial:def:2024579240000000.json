		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fs: relax assertions on failure to encode file handlesEncoding file handles is usually performed by a filesystem >encode_fh()method that may fail for various reasons.The legacy users of exportfs_encode_fh(), namely, nfsd andname_to_handle_at(2) syscall are ready to cope with the possibilityof failure to encode a file handle.There are a few other users of exportfs_encode_{fh,fid}() thatcurrently have a WARN_ON() assertion when ->encode_fh() fails.Relax those assertions because they are wrong.The second linked bug report states commit 16aac5ad1fa9 (\"ovl: supportencoding non-decodable file handles\") in v6.6 as the regressing commit,but this is not accurate.The aforementioned commit only increases the chances of the assertionand allows triggering the assertion with the reproducer using overlayfs,inotify and drop_caches.Triggering this assertion was always possible with other filesystems andother reasons of ->encode_fh() failures and more particularly, it wasalso possible with the exact same reproducer using overlayfs that ismounted with options index=on,nfs_export=on also on kernels < v6.6.Therefore, I am not listing the aforementioned commit as a Fixes commit.Backport hint: this patch will have a trivial conflict applying tov6.6.y, and other trivial conflicts applying to stable kernels < v6.6.",
