		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_workerIn the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field wasaccessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. Accordingto RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictablebehavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causinguse-after-free issues.This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developedby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a localvariable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side criticalsection. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCUrules.",
