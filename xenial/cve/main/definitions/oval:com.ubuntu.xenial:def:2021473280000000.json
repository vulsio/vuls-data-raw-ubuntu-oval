		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:iscsi: Fix conn use after free during resets If we haven't done a unbindtarget call we can race where iscsi_conn_teardown wakes up the EH threadand then frees the conn while those threads are still accessing the connehwait. We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMFfields from the conn to the session. We can then rely on theiscsi_session_teardown->iscsi_remove_session->__iscsi_unbind_session callto remove the target and it's devices, and know after that point there isno device or scsi-ml callout trying to access the session.",
