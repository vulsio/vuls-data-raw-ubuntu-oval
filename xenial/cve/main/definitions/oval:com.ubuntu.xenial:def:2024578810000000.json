		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/page_alloc: don't call pfn_to_page() on possibly non-existent PFN insplit_large_buddy()In split_large_buddy(), we might call pfn_to_page() on a PFN that mightnot exist.  In corner cases, such as when freeing the highest pageblock inthe last memory section, this could result with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM &&!CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME in __pfn_to_section() returning NULL and and__section_mem_map_addr() dereferencing that NULL pointer.Let's fix it, and avoid doing a pfn_to_page() call for the firstiteration, where we already have the page.So far this was found by code inspection, but let's just CC stable as thefix is easy.",
