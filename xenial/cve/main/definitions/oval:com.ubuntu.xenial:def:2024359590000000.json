		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Fix mlx5e_priv_init() cleanup flow When mlx5e_priv_init() fails,the cleanup flow calls mlx5e_selq_cleanup which calls mlx5e_selq_apply()that assures that the `priv->state_lock` is held using lockdep_is_held().Acquire the state_lock in mlx5e_selq_cleanup().
