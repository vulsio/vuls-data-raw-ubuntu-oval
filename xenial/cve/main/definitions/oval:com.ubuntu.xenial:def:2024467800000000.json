		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: protect references to superblock parameters exposed in sysfsThe superblock buffers of nilfs2 can not only be overwritten at runtimefor modifications/repairs, but they are also regularly swapped, replacedduring resizing, and even abandoned when degrading to one side due tobacking device issues.  So, accessing them requires mutual exclusion usingthe reader/writer semaphore \"nilfs->ns_sem\".Some sysfs attribute show methods read this superblock buffer without thenecessary mutual exclusion, which can cause problems with pointerdereferencing and memory access, so fix it.",
