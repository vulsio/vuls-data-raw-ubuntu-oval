		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:nl80211: reject iftype change with mesh ID change It's currently possibleto change the mesh ID when the interface isn't yet in mesh mode, at thesame time as changing it into mesh mode. This leads to an overwrite of datain the wdev->u union for the interface type it currently has, causingcfg80211_change_iface() to do wrong things when switching. We couldprobably allow setting an interface to mesh while setting the mesh ID atthe same time by doing a different order of operations here, butrealistically there's no userspace that's going to do this, so justdisallow changes in iftype when setting mesh ID.",
