		"title": "CVE-2021-47444 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/edid: In connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks read Incommit e11f5bd8228f (\"drm: Add support for DP 1.4 Compliance edidcorruption test\") the function connector_bad_edid() started assuming thatthe memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold `edid[0x7e] +1` blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). It completely ignored thefact that the function was passed `num_blocks` which indicated how muchmemory had been allocated for the EDID. Let's fix this by adding a boundscheck. This is important for handling the case where there's an error inthe first block of the EDID. In that case we will call connector_bad_edid()without having re-allocated memory based on `edid[0x7e]`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47444` to fix the vulnerability.
