		"description": "Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (orfetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported fromthe remote Git process to the client via the so-called \"sideband channel\".These messages will be prefixed with \"remote:\" and printed directly to thestandard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connectedto a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did notprotect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that canbe used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or tomislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on thegit-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the publicmailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unableto upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trustedsources.",
