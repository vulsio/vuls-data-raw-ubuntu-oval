		"title": "CVE-2024-38602 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ax25:Fix reference count leak issues of ax25_dev The ax25_addr_ax25dev() andax25_dev_device_down() exist a reference count leak issue of the object\"ax25_dev\". Memory leak issue in ax25_addr_ax25dev(): The reference countof the object \"ax25_dev\" can be increased multiple times inax25_addr_ax25dev(). This will cause a memory leak. Memory leak issues inax25_dev_device_down(): The reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 inax25_dev_device_up() and then increase the reference count when ax25_dev isadded to ax25_dev_list. As a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2.But when the device is shutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops thereference count once or twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not,which will cause memory leak. As for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), itis impossible for one pointer to be on a list twice. So add a break inax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for the issue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increasethe reference count of ax25_dev once in ax25_dev_device_up() and decreasethe reference count of ax25_dev after it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38602` to fix the vulnerability.
