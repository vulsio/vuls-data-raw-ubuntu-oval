		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firewire: core: fix invalid port index for parent deviceIn a commit 24b7f8e5cd65 (\"firewire: core: use helper functions for selfID sequence\"), the enumeration over self ID sequence was refactored withsome helper functions with KUnit tests. These helper functions areguaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their applicationincludes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connectedto parent device.This bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three ormore ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the pathto update the tree cache could hits WARN_ON(), and gets general protectionfault due to the access to invalid address computed by the invalid value.This commit fixes the bug to assign correct port index.",
