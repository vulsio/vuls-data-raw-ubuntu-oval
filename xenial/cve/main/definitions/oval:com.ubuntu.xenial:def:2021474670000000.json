		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: kunit:fix reference count leak in kfree_at_end The reference counting issuehappens in the normal path of kfree_at_end(). Whenkunit_alloc_and_get_resource() is invoked, the function forgets to handlethe returned resource object, whose refcount increased inside, causing arefcount leak. Fix this issue by calling kunit_alloc_resource() instead ofkunit_alloc_and_get_resource(). Fixed the following when applying: ShuahKhan <skhan@linuxfoundation.org> CHECK: Alignment should match openparenthesis + kunit_alloc_resource(test, NULL, kfree_res_free, GFP_KERNEL,(void *)to_free);",
