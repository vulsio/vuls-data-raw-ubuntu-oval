		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: caiaq: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnectionThe USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-longwaiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() atdisconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence itcan take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, whichmay trigger a soft lockup.An easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() withsnd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately whilethe release of resources is done asynchronously by the card devicerelease at the last close.This patch also splits the code to the disconnect and the free phases;the former is called immediately at the USB disconnect callback whilethe latter is called from the card destructor.",
