		"title": "CVE-2024-38553 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fec: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks There is a deadlockissue found in sungem driver, please refer to the commit ac0a230f719b(\"eth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks\"). The rootcause of the issue is that netpoll is in atomic context and disable_irq()is called by .ndo_poll_controller interface of sungem driver, however,disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzing the implementation offec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should have the same issue. Due tothe fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the .ndo_poll_controller isunnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver, so fec_poll_controller()can be safely removed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38553` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-233-generic - 4.15.0-233.245~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-233-generic - 4.15.0-233.245~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-233-lowlatency - 4.15.0-233.245~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1177-aws - 4.15.0-1177.190~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1185-azure - 4.15.0-1185.200~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-gcp - 4.15.0-1170.187~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-oracle - 4.15.0-1139.150~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
