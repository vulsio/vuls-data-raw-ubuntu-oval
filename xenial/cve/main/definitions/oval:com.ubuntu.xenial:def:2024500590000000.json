		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ntb: ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix use after free vulnerability inswitchtec_ntb_remove due to race conditionIn the switchtec_ntb_add function, it can call switchtec_ntb_init_sndevfunction, then &sndev->check_link_status_work is bound withcheck_link_status_work. switchtec_ntb_link_notification may be calledto start the work.If we remove the module which will call switchtec_ntb_remove to makecleanup, it will free sndev through kfree(sndev), while the workmentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may leadto a UAF bug is as follows:CPU0                                 CPU1                        | check_link_status_workswitchtec_ntb_remove    |kfree(sndev);           |                        | if (sndev->link_force_down)                        | // use sndevFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding withthe cleanup in switchtec_ntb_remove.",
