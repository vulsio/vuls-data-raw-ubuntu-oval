		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_privWhen mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, aslab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall toquota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is thedangling pointer.During the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is neverset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only optionfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting theDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting thenext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks thequota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.To fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting withread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-57892` to fix the vulnerability.
