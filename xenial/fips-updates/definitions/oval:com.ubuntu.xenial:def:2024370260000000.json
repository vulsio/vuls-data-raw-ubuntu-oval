		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/xe:Only use reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue The GuC contextscheduling queue is 2 entires deep, thus it is possible for a migration jobto be stuck behind a fault if migration exec queue shares engines with userjobs. This can deadlock as the migrate exec queue is required to servicepage faults. Avoid deadlock by only using reserved BCS instances for usmmigrate exec queue.
