		"description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.Grafana prior to versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 contains a directory traversalvulnerability for fully lowercase or fully uppercase .md files. Thevulnerability is limited in scope, and only allows access to files with theextension .md to authenticated users only. Grafana Cloud instances have notbeen affected by the vulnerability. Users should upgrade to patchedversions 8.3.2 or 7.5.12. For users who cannot upgrade, running a reverseproxy in front of Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request willmitigate the vulnerability. The proxy will have to also be able to handleurl encoded paths. Alternatively, for fully lowercase or fully uppercase.md files, users can block /api/plugins/.*/markdown/.* without losing anyfunctionality beyond inlined plugin help text.",
