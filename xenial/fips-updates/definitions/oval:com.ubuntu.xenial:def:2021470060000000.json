		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ARM:9064/1: hw_breakpoint: Do not directly check the event's overflow_handlerhook The commit 1879445dfa7b (\"perf/core: Set event's default::overflow_handler()\") set a default event->overflow_handler inperf_event_alloc(), and replace the check event->overflow_handler withis_default_overflow_handler(), but one is missing. Currently, thebp->overflow_handler can not be NULL. As a result, enable_single_step() isalways not invoked.
