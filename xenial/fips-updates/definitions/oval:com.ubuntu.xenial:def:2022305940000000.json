		"Title": "CVE-2022-30594 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag. Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce seccomp restrictions in some situations. A local attacker could use this to bypass intended seccomp sandbox restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-30594` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
