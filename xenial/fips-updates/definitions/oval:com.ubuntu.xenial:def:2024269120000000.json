		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaks Nouveau manages GSP-RM DMAbuffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects. Several of these buffers are neverdealloced. Some of them can be deallocated right after GSP-RM isinitialized, but the rest need to stay until the driver unloads. Alsofuther bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and clearing thenvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated. Poisoning the buffer shouldtrigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries to access the bufferafter we've deallocated it, because we were wrong about when it is safe todeallocate. Finally, change the mem->size field to a size_t because that'sthe same type that dma_alloc_coherent expects.",
