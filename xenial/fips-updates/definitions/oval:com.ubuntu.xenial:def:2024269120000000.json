		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaksNouveau manages GSP-RM DMA buffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects.  Several ofthese buffers are never dealloced.  Some of them can be deallocatedright after GSP-RM is initialized, but the rest need to stay until thedriver unloads.Also futher bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer andclearing the nvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated.  Poisoningthe buffer should trigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it triesto access the buffer after we've deallocated it, because we were wrongabout when it is safe to deallocate.Finally, change the mem->size field to a size_t because that's the sametype that dma_alloc_coherent expects.",
