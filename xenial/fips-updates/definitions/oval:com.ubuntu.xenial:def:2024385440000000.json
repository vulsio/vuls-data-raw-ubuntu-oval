		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pkt In rxe_comp_queue_pkt() anincoming response packet skb is enqueued to the resp_pkts queue and then adecision is made whether to run the completer task inline or schedule it.Finally the skb is dereferenced to bump a 'hw' performance counter. This iswrong because if the completer task is already running in a separate threadit may have already processed the skb and freed it which can cause a segfault. This has been observed infrequently in testing at high scale. Thispatch fixes this by changing the order of enqueuing the packet until afterthe counter is accessed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38544` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
