		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbindingCurrently, unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region, whileleaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can causea page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fixthis by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation,and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset`, and uses thecorrect owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.Early OF clock providers are never unregistered, and limited errorhandling is possible, so they are mostly unchanged. The error reportingis made more consistent by moving the message inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.",
