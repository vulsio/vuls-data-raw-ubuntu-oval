		"description": "Linux Kernel Bluetooth CMTP Module Double Free Privilege EscalationVulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalateprivileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker mustfirst obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the targetsystem in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw existswithin the CMTP module. The issue results from the lack of validating theexistence of an object prior to performing further free operations on theobject. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilegesand execute code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-11977.",
