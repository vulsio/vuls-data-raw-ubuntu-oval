		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:rds: fix memory leak in rds_recvmsg Syzbot reported memory leak in rds. Theproblem was in unputted refcount in case of error. int rds_recvmsg(structsocket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t size, int msg_flags) { ... if(!rds_next_incoming(rs, &inc)) { ... } After this \"if\" inc refcountincremented and if (rds_cmsg_recv(inc, msg, rs)) { ret = -EFAULT; goto out;} ... out: return ret; } in case of rds_cmsg_recv() fail the refcount won'tbe decremented. And it's easy to see from ftrace log, that rds_inc_addref()don't have rds_inc_put() pair in rds_recvmsg() after rds_cmsg_recv() 1) |rds_recvmsg() { 1) 3.721 us | rds_inc_addref(); 1) 3.853 us |rds_message_inc_copy_to_user(); 1) + 10.395 us | rds_cmsg_recv(); 1) +34.260 us | }\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47249` to fix the vulnerability.
