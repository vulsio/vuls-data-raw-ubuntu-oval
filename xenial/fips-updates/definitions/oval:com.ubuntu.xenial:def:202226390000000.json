		"Title": "CVE-2022-2639 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Open vSwitch implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out of bounds write vulnerability in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
