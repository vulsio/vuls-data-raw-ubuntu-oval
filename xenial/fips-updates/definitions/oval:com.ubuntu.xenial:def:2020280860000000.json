		"description": "pass through 1.7.3 has a possibility of using a password for an unintendedresource. For exploitation to occur, the user must do a git pull, decrypt apassword, and log into a remote service with the password. If an attackercontrols the central Git server or one of the other members' machines, andalso controls one of the services already in the password store, they canrename one of the password files in the Git repository to something else:pass doesn't correctly verify that the content of a file matches thefilename, so a user might be tricked into decrypting the wrong password andsending that to a service that the attacker controls. NOTE: forenvironments in which this threat model is of concern, signing commits canbe a solution.",
