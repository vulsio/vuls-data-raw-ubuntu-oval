		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codecSeveral functions that take part in codec's initialization and removalare re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic thebehavior of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found insound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component->probe/remove() instead.One of the reasons for that is the expectation ofsnd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to an instance ofstruct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once sound cardcomponents probing commences.As ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec device being actuallyremoved from the system, unsetting ->preset insnd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with module unload -> loadscenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned only once, duringdevice/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's module reloading mayoccur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack.",
