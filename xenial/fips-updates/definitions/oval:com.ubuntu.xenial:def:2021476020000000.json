		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mac80211: track only QoS data frames for admission control For admissioncontrol, obviously all of that only works for QoS data frames, otherwise wecannot even access the QoS field in the header. Syzbot reported (see below)an uninitialized value here due to a status of a non-QoS nullfunc packet,which isn't even long enough to contain the QoS header. Fix this to only doanything for QoS data packets.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47602` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-aws - 4.15.0-1120.128~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-gcp - 4.15.0-1116.130~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-oracle - 4.15.0-1087.95~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
