		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions Ordered workfunctions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread which executedthe normal work functions. The only way execution between normal/orderedfunctions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT, unfortunately the usedbitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever. This manifested asseemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where async_chunk::inode is seenas non-null in async_cow_submit which causes submit_compressed_extents tobe called and crash occurs because async_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL.The call trace was similar to: pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0 lr: async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0 sp : ffff800015d4bc20 <registers omitted forbrevity> Call trace: submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0 run_ordered_work+0xc8/0x280btrfs_work_helper+0x98/0x250 process_one_work+0x1f0/0x4acworker_thread+0x188/0x504 kthread+0x110/0x114 ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18 Fixthis by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all accessespreceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before setting theflag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of WORK_DONE_BIT inrun_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads would be strictlyordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures are all accesses beforeWORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered before any access that canoccur in ordered_func.",
