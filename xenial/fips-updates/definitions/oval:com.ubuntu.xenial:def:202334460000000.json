		"title": "CVE-2023-3446 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - low",
		"description": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be veryslow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(),DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parametersmay experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are beingchecked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to aDenial of Service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DHparameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter)is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSLwill not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key orparameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the suppliedmodulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. Anapplication that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtainedfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSLfunctions. An application calling any of those other functions maysimilarly be affected. The other functions affected by this areDH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSLdhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check'option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3446` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.10\nlibssl1.0.0-hmac - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.10\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
