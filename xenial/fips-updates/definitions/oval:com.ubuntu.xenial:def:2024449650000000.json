		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumptionGuenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11that had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then#DF from the stack guard.It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions onthe start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. Thisis true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.These assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leadingto a 'short' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has ashort copy of the entry text?Use the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignmentassumptions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-44965` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
