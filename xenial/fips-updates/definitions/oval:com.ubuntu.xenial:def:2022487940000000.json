		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb'sUpon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Onlyieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. In the Tx case we then leakthe skb structure.Free the skb structure upon error before returning when appropriate.As the 'is_tx = 0' cannot be moved in the complete handler because of apossible race between the delay in switching to STATE_RX_AACK_ON and anew interrupt, we introduce an intermediate 'was_tx' boolean just forthis purpose.There is no Fixes tag applying here, many changes have been made on thisarea and the issue kind of always existed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48794` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-lowlatency - 4.15.0-177.186~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1128-aws - 4.15.0-1128.137~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-gcp - 4.15.0-1122.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-oracle - 4.15.0-1093.102~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
