		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf In commit41ca9caaae0b (\"drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only\") a checkfor CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid() in orderto address possible issues on MT8167; moreover, with commit c91026a938c2(\"drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock\")another similar check was introduced. Unfortunately though, at the time ofwriting, MT8173 does not provide any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this iscrashing the kernel with NULL pointer upon enteringmtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens as soon as a HDMI cable getsplugged in. To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->confin the said function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULLpointer kernel panics.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47108` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
