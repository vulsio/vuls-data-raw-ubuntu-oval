		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/tcp: Disable TCP-AO static key after RCU grace periodThe lifetime of TCP-AO static_key is the same as the lasttcp_ao_info. On the socket destruction tcp_ao_info ceases to bewith RCU grace period, while tcp-ao static branch is currently deferreddestructed. The static key definition is: DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_DEFERRED_FALSE(tcp_ao_needed, HZ);which means that if RCU grace period is delayed by more than a secondand tcp_ao_needed is in the process of disablement, other CPUs mayyet see tcp_ao_info which atent dead, but soon-to-be.And that breaks the assumption of static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled().See the comment near the definition:> * The caller must make sure that the static key can't get disabled while> * in this function. It doesn't patch jump labels, only adds a user to> * an already enabled static key.Originally it was introduced in commit eb8c507296f6 (\"jump_label:Prevent key->enabled int overflow\"), which is needed for the atomiccontexts, one of which would be the creation of a full socket from arequest socket. In that atomic context, it's known by the presenceof the key (md5/ao) that the static branch is already enabled.So, the ref counter for that static branch is just incrementedinstead of holding the proper mutex.static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled() is just a helper for such usagecase. But it must not be used if the static branch could get disabledin parallel as it's not protected by jump_label_mutex and as a result,races with jump_label_update() implementation details.Happened on netdev test-bot[1], so not a theoretical issue:[] jump_label: Fatal kernel bug, unexpected op attcp_inbound_hash+0x1a7/0x870 [ffffffffa8c4e9b7] (eb 50 0f 1f 44 != 66 90 0f1f 00)) size:2 type:1[] ------------[ cut here ]------------[] kernel BUG at arch/x86/kernel/jump_label.c:73![] Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI[] CPU: 3 PID: 243 Comm: kworker/3:3 Not tainted 6.10.0-virtme #1[] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOSrel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014[] Workqueue: events jump_label_update_timeout[] RIP: 0010:__jump_label_patch+0x2f6/0x350...[] Call Trace:[]  <TASK>[]  arch_jump_label_transform_queue+0x6c/0x110[]  __jump_label_update+0xef/0x350[]  __static_key_slow_dec_cpuslocked.part.0+0x3c/0x60[]  jump_label_update_timeout+0x2c/0x40[]  process_one_work+0xe3b/0x1670[]  worker_thread+0x587/0xce0[]  kthread+0x28a/0x350[]  ret_from_fork+0x31/0x70[]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30[]  </TASK>[] Modules linked in: veth[] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---[] RIP: 0010:__jump_label_patch+0x2f6/0x350[1]:https://netdev-3.bots.linux.dev/vmksft-tcp-ao-dbg/results/696681/5-connect-deny-ipv6/stderr\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43887` to fix the vulnerability.
