		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tipc:wait and exit until all work queues are done On some host, a crash could betriggered simply by repeating these commands several times: # modprobe tipc# tipc bearer enable media udp name UDP1 localip 127.0.0.1 # rmmod tipc []BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffc096bb00 []Workqueue: events 0xffffffffc096bb00 [] Call Trace: [] ?process_one_work+0x1a7/0x360 [] ? worker_thread+0x30/0x390 [] ?create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0 [] ? kthread+0x116/0x130 [] ?kthread_flush_work_fn+0x10/0x10 [] ? ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40 When removingthe TIPC module, the UDP tunnel sock will be delayed to release in a workqueue as sock_release() can't be done in rtnl_lock(). If the work queue isschedule to run after the TIPC module is removed, kernel will crash as thework queue function cleanup_beareri() code no longer exists when trying toinvoke it. To fix it, this patch introduce a member wq_count in tipc_net totrack the numbers of work queues in schedule, and wait and exit until allwork queues are done in tipc_exit_net().",
