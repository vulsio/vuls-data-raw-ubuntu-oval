		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:r8169: Fix possible ring buffer corruption on fragmented Tx packets.An issue was found on the RTL8125b when transmitting small fragmentedpackets, whereby invalid entries were inserted into the transmit ringbuffer, subsequently leading to calls to dma_unmap_single() with a nulladdress.This was caused by rtl8169_start_xmit() not noticing changes to nr_fragswhich may occur when small packets are padded (to work around hardwarequirks) in rtl8169_tso_csum_v2().To fix this, postpone inspecting nr_frags until after any padding has beenapplied.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38586` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
