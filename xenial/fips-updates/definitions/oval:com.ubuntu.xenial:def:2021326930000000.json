		"description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set ofreusable PHP components. A vulnerability related to firewall authenticationis in Symfony starting with version 5.3.0 and prior to 5.3.2. When anapplication defines multiple firewalls, the token authenticated by one ofthe firewalls was available for all other firewalls. This could be abusedwhen the application defines different providers for each part of theapplication, in such a situation, a user authenticated on a part of theapplication could be considered authenticated on the rest of theapplication. Starting in version 5.3.2, a patch ensures that theauthenticated token is only available for the firewall that generates it.",
