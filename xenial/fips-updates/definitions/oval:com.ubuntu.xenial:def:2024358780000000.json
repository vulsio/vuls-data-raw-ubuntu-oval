		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: of:module: prevent NULL pointer dereference in vsnprintf() In of_modalias(),we can get passed the str and len parameters which would cause a kerneloops in vsnprintf() since it only allows passing a NULL ptr when the lengthis also 0. Also, we need to filter out the negative values of the lenparameter as these will result in a really huge buffer since snprintf()takes size_t parameter while ours is ssize_t... Found by Linux VerificationCenter (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace static analysis tool.",
