		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't trackedrq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked,such as bios ended from error handling code.Especially in bio_endio():1) request queue is referred via bio->bi_bdev->bd_disk->queue, whichmay be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above twocases2) q->rq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into__rq_qos_done_bio()Fix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops->done_bio ifthe bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio()and blkcg_iolatency_done_bio() are nop if the bio isn't tracked.",
