    "Title": "CVE-2023-42755 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier in the Linux kernel. The xprt pointer may go beyond the linear part of the skb, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `rsvp_classify` function. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system and cause a denial of service. Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). Please note that kernel packet classifier support for RSVP has been removed to resolve this vulnerability.",
