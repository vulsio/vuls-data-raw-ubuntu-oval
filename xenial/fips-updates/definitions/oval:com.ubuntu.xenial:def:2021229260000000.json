		"Description": "libcurl-using applications can ask for a specific client certificate to beused in a transfer. This is done with the `CURLOPT_SSLCERT` option(`--cert` with the command line tool).When libcurl is built to use themacOS native TLS library Secure Transport, an application can ask for theclient certificate by name or with a file name - using the same option. Ifthe name exists as a file, it will be used instead of by name.If theappliction runs with a current working directory that is writable by otherusers (like `/tmp`), a malicious user can create a file name with the samename as the app wants to use by name, and thereby trick the application touse the file based cert instead of the one referred to by name makinglibcurl send the wrong client certificate in the TLS connection handshake.",
