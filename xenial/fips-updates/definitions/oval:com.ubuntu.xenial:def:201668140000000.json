		"description": "When an application with unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0to 2.4.3, Apache Groovy 2.4.4 to 2.4.7 on classpath uses standard Javaserialization mechanisms, e.g. to communicate between servers or to storelocal data, it was possible for an attacker to bake a special serializedobject that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applicationswhich rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializesobjects were subject to this vulnerability.",
