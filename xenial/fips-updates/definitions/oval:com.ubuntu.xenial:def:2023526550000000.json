		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit If a device sends a packetthat is inbetween 0 and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim() aslength will wrap around ending up as some very large value. The driver willthen proceed to parse the header located at that position, which willeither oops or process some random value. The fix is to check againstsizeof(u64) rather than 0, which the driver currently does. The issueexists since the introduction of the driver.",
