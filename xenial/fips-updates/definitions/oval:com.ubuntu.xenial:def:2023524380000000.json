		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder:fix use-after-free in shinker's callback The mmap read lock is used duringthe shrinker's callback, which means that using alloc->vma pointer isn'tsafe as it can race with munmap(). As of commit dd2283f2605e (\"mm: mmap:zap pages with read mmap_sem in munmap\") the mmap lock is downgraded afterthe vma has been isolated. I was able to reproduce this issue by manuallyadding some delays and triggering page reclaiming through the shrinker'sdebug sysfs. The following KASAN report confirms the UAF:================================================================== BUG:KASAN: slab-use-after-free in zap_page_range_single+0x470/0x4b8 Read ofsize 8 at addr ffff356ed50e50f0 by task bash/478 CPU: 1 PID: 478 Comm: bashNot tainted 6.6.0-rc5-00055-g1c8b86a3799f-dirty #70 Hardware name:linux,dummy-virt (DT) Call trace: zap_page_range_single+0x470/0x4b8binder_alloc_free_page+0x608/0xadc __list_lru_walk_one+0x130/0x3b0list_lru_walk_node+0xc4/0x22c binder_shrink_scan+0x108/0x1dcshrinker_debugfs_scan_write+0x2b4/0x500 full_proxy_write+0xd4/0x140vfs_write+0x1ac/0x758 ksys_write+0xf0/0x1dc __arm64_sys_write+0x6c/0x9cAllocated by task 492: kmem_cache_alloc+0x130/0x368vm_area_alloc+0x2c/0x190 mmap_region+0x258/0x18bc do_mmap+0x694/0xa60vm_mmap_pgoff+0x170/0x29c ksys_mmap_pgoff+0x290/0x3a0__arm64_sys_mmap+0xcc/0x144 Freed by task 491: kmem_cache_free+0x17c/0x3c8vm_area_free_rcu_cb+0x74/0x98 rcu_core+0xa38/0x26d4 rcu_core_si+0x10/0x1c__do_softirq+0x2fc/0xd24 Last potentially related work creation:__call_rcu_common.constprop.0+0x6c/0xba0 call_rcu+0x10/0x1cvm_area_free+0x18/0x24 remove_vma+0xe4/0x118do_vmi_align_munmap.isra.0+0x718/0xb5c do_vmi_munmap+0xdc/0x1fc__vm_munmap+0x10c/0x278 __arm64_sys_munmap+0x58/0x7c Fix this issue byperforming instead a vma_lookup() which will fail to find the vma that wasisolated before the mmap lock downgrade. Note that this option has betterperformance than upgrading to a mmap write lock which would increasecontention. Plus, mmap_write_trylock() has been recently removed anyway.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52438` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
