		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:crypto: ecdh - explicitly zeroize private_keyprivate_key is overwritten with the key parameter passed in by thecaller (if present), or alternatively a newly generated private key.However, it is possible that the caller provides a key (or the newlygenerated key) which is shorter than the previous key. In thatscenario, some key material from the previous key would not beoverwritten. The easiest solution is to explicitly zeroize the entireprivate_key array first.Note that this patch slightly changes the behavior of this function:previously, if the ecc_gen_privkey failed, the old private_key wouldremain. Now, the private_key is always zeroized. This behavior isconsistent with the case where params.key is set and ecc_is_key_validfails.",
