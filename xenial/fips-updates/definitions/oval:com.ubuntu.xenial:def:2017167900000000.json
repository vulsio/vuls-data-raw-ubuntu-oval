		"description": "An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13,3.4-BETA5, and 4.0-BETA5. When a form is submitted by the user, the requesthandler classes of the Form component merge POST data and uploaded filesdata into one array. This big array forms the data that are then bound tothe form. At this stage there is no difference anymore between submittedPOST data and uploaded files. A user can send a crafted HTTP request wherethe value of a \"FileType\" is sent as normal POST data that could beinterpreted as a local file path on the server-side (for example,\"file:///etc/passwd\"). If the application did not perform any additionalchecks about the value submitted to the \"FileType\", the contents of thegiven file on the server could have been exposed to the attacker.",
