    "Title": "CVE-2022-23222 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.14 allows local users to gain privileges because of the availability of pointer arithmetic via certain *_OR_NULL pointer types. It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict pointer types in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23222` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
