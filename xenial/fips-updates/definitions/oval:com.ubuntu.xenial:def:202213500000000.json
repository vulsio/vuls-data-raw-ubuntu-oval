		"Note": "iconstantin> Issue impacts GhostPCL, we currently do not build with PCL support. mdeslaur> First commit fixes pcl/pcl/pcstatus.c, while this file exists in the focal source package (only), it does not appear to get built as debian/rules contains --without-pcl. The reproducer in the upstream bug needs PCL support to work. The second commit does fix a file that is built in Ubuntu ghostscript packages, but there is no indication that it is security relevant without the PCL support. Marking as \"low\" for now until further information becomes available."
