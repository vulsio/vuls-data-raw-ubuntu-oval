		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/damon/dbgfs: fix 'struct pid' leaks in 'dbgfs_target_ids_write()' DAMONdebugfs interface increases the reference counts of 'struct pid's fortargets from the 'target_ids' file write callback('dbgfs_target_ids_write()'), but decreases the counts only in DAMONmonitoring termination callback ('dbgfs_before_terminate()'). Therefore,when 'target_ids' file is repeatedly written without DAMON monitoringstart/termination, the reference count is not decreased and thereforememory for the 'struct pid' cannot be freed. This commit fixes this issueby decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids' is written.",
