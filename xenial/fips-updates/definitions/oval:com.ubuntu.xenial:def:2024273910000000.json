		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added Commit09ed8bfc5215 (\"wilc1000: Rename workqueue from \"WILC_wq\" to \"NETDEV-wq\"\")moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to set theinterface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver needs onlyone workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we add aninterface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a newone. This can be observed with the following commands: for i in $(seq 0 10)do iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed iw dev wlan1 del done ps-eo pid,comm|grep wlan 39 kworker/R-wlan0 98 kworker/R-wlan1 102kworker/R-wlan1 105 kworker/R-wlan1 108 kworker/R-wlan1 111 kworker/R-wlan1114 kworker/R-wlan1 117 kworker/R-wlan1 120 kworker/R-wlan1 123kworker/R-wlan1 126 kworker/R-wlan1 129 kworker/R-wlan1 Fix this leakage byputting back hif_workqueue allocation in wilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding theworkqueue name, it is indeed relevant to set it lowercase, however it isnot attached to a specific netdev, so enforcing netdev name in the name isnot so relevant. Still, enrich the name with the wiphy name to make itclear which phy is using the workqueue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27391` to fix the vulnerability.
