    "Title": "CVE-2018-19968 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An attacker can exploit phpMyAdmin before 4.8.4 to leak the contents of a local file because of an error in the transformation feature. The attacker must have access to the phpMyAdmin Configuration Storage tables, although these can easily be created in any database to which the attacker has access. An attacker must have valid credentials to log in to phpMyAdmin; this vulnerability does not allow an attacker to circumvent the login system. It was discovered that there was a bug in the way phpMyAdmin handles the phpMyAdmin Configuration Storage tables. An authenticated attacker could use this vulnerability to cause phpmyAdmin to leak sensitive files.",
