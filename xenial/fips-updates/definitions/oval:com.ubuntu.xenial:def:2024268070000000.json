		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Bothcadence-quadspi ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() implementationsstart with: struct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev); structspi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev); This obviously cannot becorrect, unless \"struct cqspi_st\" is the first member of \" structspi_controller\", or the other way around, but it is not the case. \"structspi_controller\" is allocated by devm_spi_alloc_host(), which allocates anextra amount of memory for private data, used to store \"struct cqspi_st\".The ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi driver then sets the devicedrvdata to store the address of the \"struct cqspi_st\" structure. Therefore:struct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev); is correct, but: structspi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev); is not, as it makes \"host\"point not to a \"struct spi_controller\" but to the same \"struct cqspi_st\"structure as above. This obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption,kernel crashes) directly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the deviceusing PM runtime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, whichin turns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer. This has atleast been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but the exact behaviorwill depend on the memory contents. [0]https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240226121803.5a7r5wkpbbowcxgx@dhruva/ Thisissue potentially affects all platforms that are currently using thecadence-quadspi driver.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26807` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
