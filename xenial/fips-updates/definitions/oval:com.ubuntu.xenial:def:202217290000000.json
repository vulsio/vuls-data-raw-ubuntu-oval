		"Title": "CVE-2022-1729 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "A race condition was found the Linux kernel in perf_event_open() which can be exploited by an unprivileged user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit primitives such as kernel address information leak, arbitrary execution, etc. Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1729` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
