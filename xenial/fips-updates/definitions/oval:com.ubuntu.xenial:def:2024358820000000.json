		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: SUNRPC:Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP Jan Schunk reportsthat his small NFS servers suffer from memory exhaustion after just a fewdays. A bisect shows that commit e18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message onTCP with a single sock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit. Thatcommit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in the underlyingbio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't. svc_xprt_release()releases the rqst's response pages, but the record marker page fragmentisn't one of those, so it is never released. This is a narrow fix that canbe applied to stable kernels. A more extensive fix is in the works.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35882` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
