    "Title": "CVE-2022-1789 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "With shadow paging enabled, the INVPCID instruction results in a call to kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva. If INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0, the invlpg callback is not set and the result is a NULL pointer dereference. Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1789` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
