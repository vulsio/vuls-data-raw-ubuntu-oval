    "Title": "CVE-2021-3752 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Likang Luo discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3752` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
