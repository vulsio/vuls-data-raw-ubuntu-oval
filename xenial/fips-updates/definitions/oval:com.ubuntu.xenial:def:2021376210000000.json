An infinite loop wasfound in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The infinite loop is triggeredwhen Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. Anattacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial ofservice, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted imagefile.
