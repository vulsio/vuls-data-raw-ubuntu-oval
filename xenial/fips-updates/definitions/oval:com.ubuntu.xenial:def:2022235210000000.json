		"Title": "CVE-2022-23521 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanismto allow defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined byadding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains a set offile patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching thispattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occurwhen there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributesfor a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. Theseoverflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may bepart of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB whenparsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from theindex. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file existsin the working tree, the index or both. This integer overflow can result inarbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote code execution.The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, goingback to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no knownworkarounds for this issue.",
