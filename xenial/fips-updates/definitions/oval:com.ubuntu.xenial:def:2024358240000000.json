		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Fix regulators getting en-/dis-abled twice onsuspend/resumeWhen not configured for wakeup lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() will calllis3lv02d_poweroff() even if the device has already been turned offby the runtime-suspend handler and if configured for wakeup andthe device is runtime-suspended at this point then it is not turnedback on to serve as a wakeup source.Before commit b1b9f7a49440 (\"misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Add missing settingof the reg_ctrl callback\"), lis3lv02d_poweroff() failed to disablethe regulators which as a side effect made calling poweroff() twice ok.Now that poweroff() correctly disables the regulators, doing this twicetriggers a WARN() in the regulator core:unbalanced disables for regulator-dummyWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 92 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2999 _regulator_disable...Fix lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() to not call poweroff() a second time ifalready runtime-suspended and add a poweron() call when necessary tomake wakeup work.lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() has similar issues, with an added weirness thatit always powers on the device if it is runtime suspended, after whichthe first runtime-resume will call poweron() again, causing the enabledcount for the regulator to increase by 1 every suspend/resume. Theseunbalanced regulator_enable() calls cause the regulator to neverbe turned off and trigger the following WARN() on driver unbind:WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1724 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2396 _regulator_putFix this by making lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() mirror the new suspend().",
