    "Title": "CVE-2019-9518 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a flood of empty frames, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU. It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
