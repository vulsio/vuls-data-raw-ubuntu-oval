		"Description": "fstream before 1.0.12 is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite. Extracting tarballs containing a hardlink to a file that already exists in the system, and a file that matches the hardlink, will overwrite the system's file with the contents of the extracted file. The fstream.DirWriter() function is vulnerable. It was discovered that npm/fstream incorrectly handled certain crafted tarballs. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write aritrary files to the filesystem.",
