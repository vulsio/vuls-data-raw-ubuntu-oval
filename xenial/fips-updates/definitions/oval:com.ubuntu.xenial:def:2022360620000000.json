		"Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Inversions prior to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to ImproperPreservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on somefolders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impactsGrafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards, as themigrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBACpermissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permissionin the folder is Admin, as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors andViewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issuehas been patched in versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround whenthe impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additionalpermissions manually.",
