		"description": "jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping,and cross-site scripting (XSS) safety. jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTMLincluding `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow XSS attacks whena reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default`SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including`javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will notbe sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set aContent Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue ispatched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version.Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old contentshould be cleaned again using the updated version. To remediate this issuewithout immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`,which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate[Content SecurityPolicy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined.(This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth bestpractice.)",
