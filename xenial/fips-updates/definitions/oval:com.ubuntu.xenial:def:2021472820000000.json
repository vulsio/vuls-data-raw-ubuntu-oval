		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slavesCommit 571e31fa60b3 (\"spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for->prepare_message()\") limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time.The limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare_cs[]in the driver private data which contains a per-slave register value.The commit sought to enforce the limitation at run-time by setting thecontroller's num_chipselect to 3:  Slaves with a higher chipselect arerejected by spi_add_device().However the commit neglected that num_chipselect only limits the numberof *native* chipselects.  If GPIO chipselects are specified in thedevice tree for more than 3 slaves, num_chipselect is silently raised byof_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and the result are out-of-bounds accesses tothe statically-sized array prepare_cs[].As a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable, raise the number ofallowed slaves to 24 (which \"ought to be enough for anybody\"), enforcethe limitation on slave ->setup and revert num_chipselect to 3 (which isthe number of native chipselects supported by the controller).An upcoming for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves.",
