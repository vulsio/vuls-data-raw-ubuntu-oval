		"description": "A vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perlfor Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find theshell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perlinterpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within theoperating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initiallylooks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows anattacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weakpermissions, such as `C:\\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can beexecuted when an administrator attempts to use this executable from thesecompromised locations.",
