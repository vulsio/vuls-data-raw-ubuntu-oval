		"Title": "CVE-2018-1108 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "kernel drivers before version 4.17-rc1 are vulnerable to a weakness in the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data. Programs, early in the boot sequence, could use the data allocated for the seed before it was sufficiently generated. Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1108` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
