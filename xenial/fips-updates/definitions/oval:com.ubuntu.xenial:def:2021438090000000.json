		"description": "`Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In`bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted andapparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead toexecution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code insidethe `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries thatuse the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with aleading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from aGit repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, suchas `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g.the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing anarray of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is thepossibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is thereforetreated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can leadto Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can beleveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the`Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. Toexploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containinga `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Gitrepository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of`-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command butwill be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needsto be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command thatevaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerabilitycan lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to thetakeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because itrequires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problemby inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to thoseGit commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether userscan upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s beforerunning any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can containarbitrary ruby code.",
