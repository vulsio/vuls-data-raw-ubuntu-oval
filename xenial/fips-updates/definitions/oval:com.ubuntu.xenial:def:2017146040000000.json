		"description": "GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type byusing the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a.desktop file's Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec field launchesa malicious \"sh -c\" command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UIindication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktopextension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly)mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to haveexecute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that thefile is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember theuser's answer in the metadata::trusted field.",
