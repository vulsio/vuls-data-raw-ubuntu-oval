		"Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.Starting with the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16, 9.2.10, and9.3.4, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core pluginGeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because SVG files weren'tproperly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in thecontext of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. Anattacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel toinclude either an external URL to a SVG-file containing JavaScript, or usethe `data:` scheme to load an inline SVG-file containing JavaScript. Thismeans that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user withEditor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role ifthe user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.Users may upgrade to version 8.5.16, 9.2.10, or 9.3.4 to receive a fix.",
