		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:s390: fix setting of fpc register kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_fpu() allows toset the floating point control (fpc) register of a guest cpu. The new valueis tested for validity by temporarily loading it into the fpc register.This may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the host process: if aninterrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpcregister, and within interrupt context floating point or vector registersare used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with save_fpu_regs()assuming they belong to user space and will be loaded into fp/vx registerswhen returning to user space. test_fp_ctl() restores the original userspace / host process fpc register value, however it will be discarded, whenreturning to user space. In result the host process will incorrectlycontinue to run with the value that was supposed to be used for a guestcpu. Fix this by simply removing the test. There is another test rightbefore the SIE context is entered which will handles invalid values. Thisresults in a change of behaviour: invalid values will now be acceptedinstead of that the ioctl fails with -EINVAL. This seems to be acceptable,given that this interface is most likely not used anymore, and this is inaddition the same behaviour implemented with the memory mapped interface(replace invalid values with zero) - see sync_regs() in kvm-s390.c.",
