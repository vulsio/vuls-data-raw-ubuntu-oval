		"Description": "An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTMLmethod applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as anemail message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative imageURLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no basedirectory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLsget treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To forma remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed anunfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.",
