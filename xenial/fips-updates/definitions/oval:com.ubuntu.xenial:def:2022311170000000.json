		"description": "UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C withbindings for Python 3.7+. In versions prior to 5.4.0 an error occurringwhile reallocating a buffer for string decoding can cause the buffer to getfreed twice. Due to how UltraJSON uses the internal decoder, this doublefree is impossible to trigger from Python. This issue has been resolved inversion 5.4.0 and all users should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0. There are noknown workarounds for this issue.",
