		"Title": "CVE-2023-26049 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. Nonstandard cookieparsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within othercookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with thecookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"`(double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees aclosing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie headersuch as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as onecookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337;c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications becauseif, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookievalue is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONIDcookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This issignificant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies,so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jettyserver or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised toupgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
