		"Title": "CVE-2022-47929 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with \"tc qdisc\" and \"tc class\" commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c. It was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
