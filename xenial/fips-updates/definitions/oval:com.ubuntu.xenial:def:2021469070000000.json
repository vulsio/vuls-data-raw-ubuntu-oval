		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:VMX: Don't use vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an array index__vmx_handle_exit() uses vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an index for an arrayaccess. Since vcpu->run is (can be) mapped to a user address space with awriter permission, the 'ndata' could be updated by the user process atanytime (the user process can set it to outside the bounds of the array).So, it is not safe that __vmx_handle_exit() uses the 'ndata' that way.",
