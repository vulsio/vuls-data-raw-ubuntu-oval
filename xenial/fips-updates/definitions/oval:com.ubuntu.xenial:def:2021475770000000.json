		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io-wq: check for wq exit after adding new worker task_workWe check IO_WQ_BIT_EXIT before attempting to create a new worker, andwq exit cancels pending work if we have any. But it's possible to havea race between the two, where creation checks exit finding it not set,but we're in the process of exiting. The exit side will cancel pendingcreation task_work, but there's a gap where we add task_work after we'vecanceled existing creations at exit time.Fix this by checking the EXIT bit post adding the creation task_work.If it's set, run the same cancelation that exit does.",
