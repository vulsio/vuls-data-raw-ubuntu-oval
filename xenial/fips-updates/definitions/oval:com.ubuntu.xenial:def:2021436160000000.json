		"description": "** DISPUTED ** The npm ci command in npm 7.x and 8.x through 8.1.3 proceedswith an installation even if dependency information in package-lock.jsondiffers from package.json. This behavior is inconsistent with thedocumentation, and makes it easier for attackers to install malware thatwas supposed to have been blocked by an exact version match requirement inpackage-lock.json. NOTE: The npm team believes this is not a vulnerability.It would require someone to socially engineer package.json which hasdifferent dependencies than package-lock.json. That user would have to havefile system or write access to change dependencies. The npm team statespreventing malicious actors from socially engineering or gaining filesystem access is outside the scope of the npm CLI.",
