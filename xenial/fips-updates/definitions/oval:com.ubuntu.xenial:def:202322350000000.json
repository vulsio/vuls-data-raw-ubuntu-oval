		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel Performance Eventssystem can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Theperf_group_detach function did not check the event's siblings' attach_statebefore calling add_event_to_groups(), but remove_on_exec made it possibleto call list_del_event() on before detaching from their group, making itpossible to use a dangling pointer causing a use-after-free vulnerability.We recommend upgrading past commitfd0815f632c24878e325821943edccc7fde947a2.",
