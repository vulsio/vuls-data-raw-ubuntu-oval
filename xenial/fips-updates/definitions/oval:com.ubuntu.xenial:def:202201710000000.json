    "Title": "CVE-2022-0171 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The existing KVM SEV API has a vulnerability that allows a non-root (host) user-level application to crash the host kernel by creating a confidential guest VM instance in AMD CPU that supports Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). Mingwei Zhang discovered that the KVM implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle cache coherency with Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0171` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
