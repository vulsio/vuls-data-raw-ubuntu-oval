		"Title": "CVE-2023-1076 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters. It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
