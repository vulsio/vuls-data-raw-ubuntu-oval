		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/64: Fix the definition of the fixmap area At the time being, thefixmap area is defined at the top of the address space or just below KASAN.This definition is not valid for PPC64. For PPC64, use the top of the I/Ospace. Because of circular dependencies, it is not possible to includeasm/fixmap.h in asm/book3s/64/pgtable.h , so define a fixed size AREA atthe top of the I/O space for fixmap and ensure during build that the sizeis big enough.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47018` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
