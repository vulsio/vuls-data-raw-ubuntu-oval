		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: udf:Fix NULL pointer dereference in udf_symlink function In functionudf_symlink, epos.bh is assigned with the value returned by udf_tgetblk.The function udf_tgetblk is defined in udf/misc.c and returns the value ofsb_getblk function that could be NULL. Then, epos.bh is used without anycheck, causing a possible NULL pointer dereference when sb_getblk fails.This fix adds a check to validate the value of epos.bh.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47353` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
