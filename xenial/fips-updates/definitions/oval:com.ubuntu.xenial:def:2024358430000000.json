		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Use device rbtree in iopf reporting path The existing I/O pagefault handler currently locates the PCI device by callingpci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This function searches the list of all PCIdevices until the desired device is found. To improve lookup efficiency,replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device within the probeddevice rbtree. The I/O page fault is initiated by the device, which doesnot have any synchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that thedevice stays in the probed device tree. Theoretically, a device could bereleased by the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and beforeiopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem. Adda mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMUrelease device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead,as the conflict between I/O page fault reporting and device releasing isvery rare.",
