		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ftrace:Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug() It was reported that abug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for updating into a nop inftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully) returned -EINVAL and not-EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to occur. But because-EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report what was at thelocation of the ip address, and read it directly. This caused the machineto panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory address. Instead,read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely access thememory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted, otherwise reportwhat was in that location.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47276` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
