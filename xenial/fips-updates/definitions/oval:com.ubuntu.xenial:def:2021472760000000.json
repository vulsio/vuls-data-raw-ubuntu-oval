		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ftrace:Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug() It was reported that abug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for updating into a nop inftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully) returned -EINVAL and not-EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to occur. But because-EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report what was at thelocation of the ip address, and read it directly. This caused the machineto panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory address. Instead,read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely access thememory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted, otherwise reportwhat was in that location.",
