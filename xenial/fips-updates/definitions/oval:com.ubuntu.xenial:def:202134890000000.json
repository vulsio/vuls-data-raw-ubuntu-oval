		"title": "CVE-2021-3489 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high",
		"description": "The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did notcheck that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowingan attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the kernel andtherefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit4b81ccebaeee (\"bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf\")(v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, andv5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88 (\"bpf: Implement BPF ringbuffer and verifier support for it\") (v5.8-rc1).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3489` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
