		"description": "By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as aconfiguration parameter where the values to be inserted are converters fromPatternLayout. The message converter, %m, is likely to always be included.This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted stringsinto input fields or headers of an application that are logged allowingunintended SQL queries to be executed. Note this issue only affects Log4j1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not thedefault. Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introducedwith proper support for parameterized SQL queries and further customizationover the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of lifein August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerousother issues from the previous versions.",
