		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_start DECOMMISSION thecurrent SEV context if binding an ASID fails after RECEIVE_START. Per AMD'sSEV API, RECEIVE_START generates a new guest context and thus needs to bepaired with DECOMMISSION: The RECEIVE_START command is the only commandother than the LAUNCH_START command that generates a new guest context andguest handle. The missing DECOMMISSION can result in subsequent SEV launchfailures, as the firmware leaks memory and might not able to allocate moreSEV guest contexts in the future. Note, LAUNCH_START suffered the same bug,but was previously fixed by commit 934002cd660b (\"KVM: SVM: Call SEV GuestDecommission if ASID binding fails\").\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47389` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
