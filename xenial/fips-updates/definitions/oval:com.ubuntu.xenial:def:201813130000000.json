If the Derby NetworkServer is not running with a Java Security Manager policy file, the attackis successful. If the server is using a policy file, the policy file mustpermit the database location to be read for the attack to work. The defaultDerby Network Server policy file distributed with the affected releasesincludes a permissive policy as the default Network Server policy, whichallows the attack to work.",
