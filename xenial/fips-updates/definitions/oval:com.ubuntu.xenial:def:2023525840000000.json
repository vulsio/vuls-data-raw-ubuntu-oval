		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device removeThe pmif driver data that contains the clocks is allocated along withspmi_controller.On device remove, spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres, including the clocks, will be cleanup.This leads to UAF because putting the clocks will access the clocks inthe pmif driver data, which is already freed along with spmi_controller.This can be reproduced by enabling DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE andbuilding the kernel with KASAN.Fix the UAF issue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting theclocks before freeing spmi_controller.",
