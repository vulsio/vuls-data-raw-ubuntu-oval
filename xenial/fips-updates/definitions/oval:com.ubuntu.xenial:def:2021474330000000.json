		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix abort logic in btrfs_replace_file_extents Error injection testinguncovered a case where we'd end up with a corrupt file system with amissing extent in the middle of a file. This occurs because the ifstatement to decide if we should abort is wrong. The only way we wouldabort in this case is if we got a ret != -EOPNOTSUPP and we called from thefile clone code. However the prealloc code uses this path too. Instead weneed to abort if there is an error, and the only error we _don't_ abort onis -EOPNOTSUPP and only if we came from the clone file code.",
