		"Description": "The 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image URLafter redirects. By embedding an image that triggered authentication flows- in conjunction with a Content Security Policy that stopped a redirectionchain in the middle - the final image URL could be one that contained anauthentication token used to takeover a user account. If a website trickeda user into copy and pasting the image link back to the page, the pagewould be able to steal the authentication tokens. This was fixed by makingthe action return the original URL, before any redirects. Thisvulnerability affects Firefox < 94.",
