    "Title": "CVE-2022-36280 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds(OOB) memory access vulnerability was found in vmwgfx driver in drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_kms.c in GPU component in the Linux kernel with device file '/dev/dri/renderD128 (or Dxxx)'. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain privilege, causing a denial of service(DoS). Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
