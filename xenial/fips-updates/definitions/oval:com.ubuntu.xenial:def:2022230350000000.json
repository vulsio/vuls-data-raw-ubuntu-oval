		"description": "Insufficient cleanup of passed-through device IRQs The management of IRQsassociated with physical devices exposed to x86 HVM guests involves aniterative operation in particular when cleaning up after the guest's use ofthe device. In the case where an interrupt is not quiescent yet at the timethis cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be scheduled to beretried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retrymay get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared(resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in ause-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to bevalid.",
