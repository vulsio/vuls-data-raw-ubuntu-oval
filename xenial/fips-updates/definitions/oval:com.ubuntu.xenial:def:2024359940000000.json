		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix memory related IO errors and crashesIt turns out that while the QSEECOM APP_SEND command has specific fieldsfor request and response buffers, uefisecapp expects them both to be ina single memory region. Failure to adhere to this has (so far) resultedin either no response being written to the response buffer (causing anEIO to be emitted down the line), the SCM call to fail with EINVAL(i.e., directly from TZ/firmware), or the device to be hard-reset.While this issue can be triggered deterministically, in the current formit seems to happen rather sporadically (which is why it has goneunnoticed during earlier testing). This is likely due to the twokzalloc() calls (for request and response) being directly after eachother. Which means that those likely return consecutive regions most ofthe time, especially when not much else is going on in the system.Fix this by allocating a single memory region for both request andresponse buffers, properly aligning both structs inside it. Thisunfortunately also means that the qcom_scm_qseecom_app_send() interfaceneeds to be restructured, as it should no longer map the DMA regionsseparately. Therefore, move the responsibility of DMA allocation (ormapping) to the caller.",
