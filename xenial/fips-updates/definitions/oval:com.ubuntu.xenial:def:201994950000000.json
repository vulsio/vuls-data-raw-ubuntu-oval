		"Title": "CVE-2019-9495 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. All versions of hostapd and wpa_supplicant with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The ability to install and execute applications is necessary for a successful attack. Memory access patterns are visible in a shared cache. Weak passwords may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa_supplicant 2.7 and newer, are not vulnerable to the timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9495` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhostapd - 2.4-0ubuntu6.4\nNo subscription required\n\nwpagui - 2.4-0ubuntu6.4\nwpasupplicant - 2.4-0ubuntu6.4\nNo subscription required",
