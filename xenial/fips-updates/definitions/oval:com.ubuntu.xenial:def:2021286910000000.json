		"Title": "CVE-2021-28691 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Guest triggered use-after-free in Linux xen-netback A malicious or buggynetwork PV frontend can force Linux netback to disable the interface andterminate the receive kernel thread associated with queue 0 in response tothe frontend sending a malformed packet. Such kernel thread terminationwill lead to a use-after-free in Linux netback when the backend isdestroyed, as the kernel thread associated with queue 0 will have alreadyexited and thus the call to kthread_stop will be performed against a stalepointer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28691` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
