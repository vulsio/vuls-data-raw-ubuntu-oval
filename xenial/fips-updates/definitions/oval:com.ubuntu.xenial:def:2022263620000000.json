Thisscheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety, e.g. PVguests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables; updates needauditing by Xen. Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type referencehas a race condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early andcreates a window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mappingbefore writeability is prohibited.",
