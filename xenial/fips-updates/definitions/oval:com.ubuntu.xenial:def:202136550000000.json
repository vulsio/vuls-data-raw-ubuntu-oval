		"Title": "CVE-2021-3655 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. Ilja Van Sprundel discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform size validations on incoming packets in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
