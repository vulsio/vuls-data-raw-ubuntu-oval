		"description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issueis in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through aloop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written,but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes.That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous elementcorrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause adenial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality.",
