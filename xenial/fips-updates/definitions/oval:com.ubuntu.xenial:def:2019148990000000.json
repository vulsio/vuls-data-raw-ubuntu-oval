		"description": "A vulnerability was discovered in Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, iOS, andAndroid that allows a malicious access point, or an adjacent user, todetermine if a connected user is using a VPN, make positive inferencesabout the websites they are visiting, and determine the correct sequenceand acknowledgement numbers in use, allowing the bad actor to inject datainto the TCP stream. This provides everything that is needed for anattacker to hijack active connections inside the VPN tunnel.",
