		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: vt: fixmemory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer A memory overlappingcopy occurs when deleting a long line. This memory overlapping copy cancause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is optimized to memcpy becausememcpy does not ensure its behavior if the destination buffer overlaps withthe source buffer. The line buffer is not always broken, because the memcpyutilizes the hardware acceleration, whose result is not deterministic. Fixthis problem by using replacing the scr_memcpyw with scr_memmovew.",
