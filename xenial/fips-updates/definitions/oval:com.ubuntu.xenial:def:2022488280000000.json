		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSD: Fix ia_size underflowiattr::ia_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 andNFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus thereis a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that isalready larger than Linux can handle.Currently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. Ifthat value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_sizeunderflows. I'm about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let'scatch the underflow in the common code path: nfsd_setattr().",
