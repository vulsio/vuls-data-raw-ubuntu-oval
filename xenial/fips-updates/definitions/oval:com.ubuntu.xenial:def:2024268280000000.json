		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()In this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item we checkif the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However,the problem is that \"bytes_left\" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is typesize_t.  That means that because of type promotion, the comparison isdone as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left the loopcontinues instead of ending.",
