		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_dataThere is a lack of verification of the space occupied by fixed membersof xlog_op_header in the xlog_recover_process_data.We can create a crafted image to trigger an out of bounds read byfollowing these steps:    1) Mount an image of xfs, and do some file operations to leave records    2) Before umounting, copy the image for subsequent steps to simulate       abnormal exit. Because umount will ensure that tail_blk and       head_blk are the same, which will result in the inability to enter       xlog_recover_process_data    3) Write a tool to parse and modify the copied image in step 2    4) Make the end of the xlog_op_header entries only 1 byte away from       xlog_rec_header->h_size    5) xlog_rec_header->h_num_logops++    6) Modify xlog_rec_header->h_crcFix:Add a check to make sure there is sufficient space to access fixed membersof xlog_op_header.",
