		"description": "Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy webservices. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable toServer-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server orNotebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled is affected. A lack ofinput validation allows authenticated clients to proxy requests to otherhosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication isrequired, which already grants permissions to make the same requests viakernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity.Users may upgrade to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround,install the patch manually.",
