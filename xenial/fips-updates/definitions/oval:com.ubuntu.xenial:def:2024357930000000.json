		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:debugfs: fix wait/cancellation handling during remove Ben Greear furtherreports deadlocks during concurrent debugfs remove while files are beingaccessed, even though the code in question now uses debugfs cancellations.Turns out that despite all the review on the locking, we missed completelythat the logic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (and neednot wait for the completion), but if it doesn't we have to trigger all thecancellations. As written, we can _never_ get into the loop triggering thecancellations. Fix this, and explain it better while at it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35793` to fix the vulnerability.
