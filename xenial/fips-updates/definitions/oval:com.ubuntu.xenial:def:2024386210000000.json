		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: stk1160: fix bounds checking in stk1160_copy_video()The subtract in this condition is reversed.  The ->length is the lengthof the buffer.  The ->bytesused is how many bytes we have copied thusfar.  When the condition is reversed that means the result of thesubtraction is always negative but since it's unsigned then the resultis a very high positive value.  That means the overflow check is nevertrue.Additionally, the ->bytesused doesn't actually work for this purposebecause we're not writing to \"buf->mem + buf->bytesused\".  Instead, themath to calculate the destination where we are writing is a bitinvolved.  You calculate the number of full lines already written,multiply by two, skip a line if necessary so that we start on an oddnumbered line, and add the offset into the line.To fix this buffer overflow, just take the actual destination where weare writing, if the offset is already out of bounds print an error andreturn.  Otherwise, write up to buf->length bytes.",
