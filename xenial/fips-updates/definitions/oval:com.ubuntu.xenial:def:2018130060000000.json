		"Title": "CVE-2018-13006 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in MP4Box in GPAC 0.7.1. There is a heap-based buffer over-read in the isomedia/box_dump.c function hdlr_dump. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-13006` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngpac - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-1ubuntu0.1\ngpac-modules-base - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-1ubuntu0.1\nlibgpac4 - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
