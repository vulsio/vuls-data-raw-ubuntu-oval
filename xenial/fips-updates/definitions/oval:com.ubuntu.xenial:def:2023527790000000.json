		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs:Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface function Whenvfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface function thenthe 'nosec' should propagate into this function so that vfs_getattr_nosec()can again be called from the filesystem's gettattr rather thanvfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary security checks that theinitial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid. Therefore, introduce thegetattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass with the new getattr_flagsparameter to the getattr interface function. In overlayfs and ecryptfs usethis flag to determine which one of the two functions to call. In a recentcode change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up callingvfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn called security_inode_getattr()on an exiting process that did not have current->fs set anymore, which thencaused a kernel NULL pointer dereference. With this change the call tosecurity_inode_getattr() can be avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointerdereference.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52779` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
