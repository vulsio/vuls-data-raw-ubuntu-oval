		"Description": "In CatromWeights(), MeshInterpolate(), InterpolatePixelChannel(),InterpolatePixelChannels(), and InterpolatePixelInfo(), which are allfunctions in /MagickCore/pixel.c, there were multiple unconstrained pixeloffset calculations which were being used with the floor() function. Thesecalculations produced undefined behavior in the form of out-of-range andinteger overflows, as identified by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Theseinstances of undefined behavior could be triggered by an attacker who isable to supply a crafted input file to be processed by ImageMagick. Theseissues could impact application availability or potentially cause otherproblems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagickversions prior to 7.0.9-0.",
