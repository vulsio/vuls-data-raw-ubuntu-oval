    "Title": "CVE-2022-0847 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way the \"flags\" member of the new pipe buffer structure was lacking proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the Linux kernel and could thus contain stale values. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files and as such escalate their privileges on the system. Max Kellermann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly handled Unix pipes. A local attacker could potentially use this to modify any file that could be opened for reading.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0847` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",

    "Note": "mdeslaur> The specific flaw exists in the bionic and focal, but is not currently exploitable due to lack of a flag that was introduced in kernel 5.8. The flaw will be fixed as part of the next round of bionic and focal kernel updates in case some other way of exploiting it is discovered in the future. The hardware enablement kernel for focal, linux-hwe-5.13, was updated to fix this issue in USN-5317-1."
