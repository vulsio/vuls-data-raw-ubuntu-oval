		"description": "A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when a file is moved using atomic_moveprimitive as the file mode cannot be specified. This sets the destinationfiles world-readable if the destination file does not exist and if the fileexists, the file could be changed to have less restrictive permissionsbefore the move. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data. Allversions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.",
