		"title": "CVE-2021-26931 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - low",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as usedin Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug,deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at leastunder the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn'tcorrect to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing suchcrashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affectsdrivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-26931` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.2.0-16-generic - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.2.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.2.0-16-lowlatency - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.2.0-16-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.2.0-16-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.2.0-16-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.2.0-16-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-extra-4.2.0-16-generic - 4.4.0-207.239\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1091-kvm - 4.4.0-1091.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1126-aws - 4.4.0-1126.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1150-raspi2 - 4.4.0-1150.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1154-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1154.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
