		"Title": "CVE-2021-3750 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the USB EHCI controller emulation ofQEMU. EHCI does not verify if the Buffer Pointer overlaps with its MMIOregion when it transfers the USB packets. Crafted content may be written tothe controller's registers and trigger undesirable actions (such as reset)while the device is still transferring packets. This can ultimately lead toa use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash theQEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, orpotentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU processon the host. This flaw affects QEMU versions before 7.0.0.",
