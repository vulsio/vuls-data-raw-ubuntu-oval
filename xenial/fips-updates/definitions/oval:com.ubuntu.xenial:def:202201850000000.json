An unprivileged (incase of unprivileged user namespaces enabled, otherwise needs namespacedCAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege) local user able to open a filesystem that does notsupport the Filesystem Context API (and thus fallbacks to legacy handling)could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0185` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
