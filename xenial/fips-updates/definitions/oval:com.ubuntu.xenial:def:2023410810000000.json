		"description": "Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081 The mod_jk component ofApache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances, such as when aconfiguration included \"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories\" but theconfiguration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible proxiedrequests, mod_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the request to thefirst defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in theunintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraintsconfigured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionalityhas been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration.Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is notaffected. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from1.2.0 through 1.2.48. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49,which fixes the issue.
