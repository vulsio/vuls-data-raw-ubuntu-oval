		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty When processing apacked profile in unpack_profile() described like \"profile:ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}\" a string\":samba-dcerpcd\" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then passed toaa_splitn_fqname(). aa_splitn_fqname() treats \":samba-dcerpcd\" as onlycontaining a namespace. Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpnsis non-NULL. Later aa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name isNULL now. general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI KASAN: null-ptr-derefin range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007] CPU: 6 PID: 1657 Comm:apparmor_parser Not tainted 6.7.0-rc2-dirty #16 Hardware name: QEMUStandard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOSrel-1.16.2-3-gd478f380-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014 RIP:0010:strlen+0x1e/0xa0 Call Trace: <TASK> ? strlen+0x1e/0xa0aa_policy_init+0x1bb/0x230 aa_alloc_profile+0xb1/0x480unpack_profile+0x3bc/0x4960 aa_unpack+0x309/0x15e0aa_replace_profiles+0x213/0x33c0 policy_update+0x261/0x370profile_replace+0x20e/0x2a0 vfs_write+0x2af/0xe00 ksys_write+0x126/0x250do_syscall_64+0x46/0xf0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76 </TASK>---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]--- RIP: 0010:strlen+0x1e/0xa0 It seemssuch behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in otherplaces where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there is anexplicit comment \"a ns name without a following profile is allowed\" inside.AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked \"name\" to be in form like\":samba-dcerpcd\" - it is passed from userspace. Deny the whole profile setreplacement in such case and inform user with EPROTO and an explainingmessage. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org).",
