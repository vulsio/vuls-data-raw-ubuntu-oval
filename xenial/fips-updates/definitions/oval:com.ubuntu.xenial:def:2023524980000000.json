		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: PM:sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code It is reportedthat in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core code deadlocks,because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument function synchronouslyif it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that functionattempts to acquire a mutex that is already held. Executing the argumentfunction synchronously from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematicfor ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer device's resume callback tobe invoked before a requisite supplier device's one, for example). Addressthis by changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall()for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resumefunctions and to directly run them synchronously ifasync_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52498` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
