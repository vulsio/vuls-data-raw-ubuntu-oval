		"Title": "CVE-2023-1032 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "The Linux kernel io_uring IORING_OP_SOCKET operation contained a double free in function __sys_socket_file() in file net/socket.c. This issue was introduced in da214a475f8bd1d3e9e7a19ddfeb4d1617551bab and fixed in 649c15c7691e9b13cbe9bf6c65c365350e056067. Thadeu Cascardo discovered that the io_uring subsystem contained a double- free vulnerability in certain memory allocation error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
