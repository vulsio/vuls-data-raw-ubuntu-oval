		"description": "Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format toanother, and a command-line tool that uses this library. Starting inversion 1.13 and prior to version 3.1.4, Pandoc is susceptible to anarbitrary file write vulnerability, which can be triggered by providing aspecially crafted image element in the input when generating files usingthe `--extract-media` option or outputting to PDF format. Thisvulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files onthe system ,depending on the privileges of the process running pandoc. Itonly affects systems that pass untrusted user input to pandoc and allowpandoc to be used to produce a PDF or with the `--extract-media` option.The fix is to unescape the percent-encoding prior to checking that theresource is not above the working directory, and prior to extracting theextension. Some code for checking that the path is below the workingdirectory was flawed in a similar way and has also been fixed. Note thatthe `--sandbox` option, which only affects IO done by readers and writersthemselves, does not block this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patchedin pandoc 3.1.4. As a workaround, audit the pandoc command and disallow PDFoutput and the `--extract-media` option.",
