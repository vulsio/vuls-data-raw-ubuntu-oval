    "Title": "CVE-2021-43056 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel for powerpc before 5.14.15. It allows a malicious KVM guest to crash the host, when the host is running on Power8, due to an arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S implementation bug in the handling of the SRR1 register values. It was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be resolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-43056` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
