		"Title": "CVE-2023-4385 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing sanity check. It was discovered that the JFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate memory allocations in certain situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious JFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
