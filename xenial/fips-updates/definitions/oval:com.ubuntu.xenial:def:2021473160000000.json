		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfsd:fix NULL dereference in nfs3svc_encode_getaclres In error cases the dentrymay be NULL. Before 20798dfe249a, the encoder also checked dentry andd_really_is_positive(dentry), but that looks like overkill to me--zerostatus should be enough to guarantee a positive dentry. This isn't thefirst time we've seen an error-case NULL dereference hidden in theinitialization of a local variable in an xdr encoder. But I went backthrough the other recent rewrites and didn't spot any similar bugs.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47316` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
