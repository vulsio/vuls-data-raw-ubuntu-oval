Inaffected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to loadand execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating theprocessed input stream. A user is only affected if using the version out ofthe box with JDK 1.7u21 or below. However, this scenario can be adjustedeasily to an external Xalan that works regardless of the version of theJava runtime. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setupXStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimalrequired types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, sinceit cannot be secured for general purpose.",
