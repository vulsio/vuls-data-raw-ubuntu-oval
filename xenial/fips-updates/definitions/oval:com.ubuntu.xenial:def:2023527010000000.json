		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:use a bounce buffer for copying skb->mark syzbot found arm64 builds wouldcrash in sock_recv_mark() when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY=y x86 and powerpcare not detecting the issue because they define user_access_begin. Thiswill be handled in a different patch, because a check_object_size() ismissing. Only data from skb->cb[] can be copied directly to/from userspace, as explained in commit 79a8a642bf05 (\"net: Whitelist theskbuff_head_cache \"cb\" field\") syzbot report was: usercopy: Kernel memoryexposure attempt detected from SLUB object 'skbuff_head_cache' (offset 168,size 4)! ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG atmm/usercopy.c:102 !
