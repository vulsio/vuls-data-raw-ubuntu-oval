		"Title": "CVE-2018-13098 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (slab out-of-bounds read and BUG) can occur for a modified f2fs filesystem image in which FI_EXTRA_ATTR is set in an inode. Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-13098` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws - 4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1055-azure - 4.15.0-1055.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1040-gcp - 4.15.0-1040.42~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-58-generic - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-58-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-58-lowlatency - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-58-generic - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-58-lowlatency - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1021-oracle - 4.15.0-1021.23~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws - 4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1055-azure - 4.15.0-1055.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1040-gcp - 4.15.0-1040.42~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-58-generic - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-58-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-58-lowlatency - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-58-generic - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-58-lowlatency - 4.15.0-58.64~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1021-oracle - 4.15.0-1021.23~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
