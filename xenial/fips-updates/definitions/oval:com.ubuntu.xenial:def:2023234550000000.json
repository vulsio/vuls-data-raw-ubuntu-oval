		"Title": "CVE-2023-23455 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "atm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). Kyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
