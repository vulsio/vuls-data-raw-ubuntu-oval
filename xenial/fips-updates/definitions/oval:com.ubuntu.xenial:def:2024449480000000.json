		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mtrr: Check if fixed MTRRs exist before saving themMTRRs have an obsolete fixed variant for fine grained caching controlof the 640K-1MB region that uses separate MSRs. This fixed variant hasa separate capability bit in the MTRR capability MSR.So far all x86 CPUs which support MTRR have this separate bit set, so itwent unnoticed that mtrr_save_state() does not check the capability bitbefore accessing the fixed MTRR MSRs.Though on a CPU that does not support the fixed MTRR capability thisresults in a #GP.  The #GP itself is harmless because the RDMSR fault ishandled gracefully, but results in a WARN_ON().Add the missing capability check to prevent this.",
