    "Description": "The default configuration of OpenSSH through 6.1 enforces a fixed time limit between establishing a TCP connection and completing a login, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) by periodically making many new TCP connections.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2010-5107` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:6.1p1-3\nopenssh-client-ssh1 - 1:6.1p1-3\nopenssh-server - 1:6.1p1-3\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:6.1p1-3\nssh - 1:6.1p1-3\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:6.1p1-3\nssh-krb5 - 1:6.1p1-3\nNo subscription required",
