		"Title": "CVE-2020-26259 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. InXStream before version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletionon the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remoteattacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executingprocess has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed inputstream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the SecurityFramework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reportedvulnerability does not exist running Java 15 or higher. No user isaffected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's SecurityFramework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklistcan immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid thevulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to useXStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailedin the referenced advisories.",
