		"description": "Python 3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows localprivilege escalation in a non-default configuration. The Pythonmultiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method onLinux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machinelocal network namespace, which in many system configurations means any useron the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allowsfor local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver processis running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported toFalse is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing isnot the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because onlyLinux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not makeuse of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for usersmanually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API callsin order to do that in CPython before 3.9.",
