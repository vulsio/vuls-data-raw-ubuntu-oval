		"Description": "LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros withindocuments, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the documentoccurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. AnImproper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed anattacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating thedocumentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document tocombine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice todisplay a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to thesignature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.",
