    "Description": "Mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions may allow arbitrary speculative code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions. Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some AMD x86-64 processors, the branch predictor could by mis-trained for return instructions in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
