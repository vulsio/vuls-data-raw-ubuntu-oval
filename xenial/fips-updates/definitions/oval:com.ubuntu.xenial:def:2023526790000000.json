		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:of: Fix double free in of_parse_phandle_with_args_mapIn of_parse_phandle_with_args_map() the inner loop thatiterates through the map entries calls of_node_put(new)to free the reference acquired by the previous iterationof the inner loop. This assumes that the value of \"new\" isNULL on the first iteration of the inner loop.Make sure that this is true in all iterations of the outerloop by setting \"new\" to NULL after its value is assigned to \"cur\".Extend the unittest to detect the double free and add an additionaltest case that actually triggers this path.",
