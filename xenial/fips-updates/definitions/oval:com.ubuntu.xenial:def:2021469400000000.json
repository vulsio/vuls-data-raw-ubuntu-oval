		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tools/power turbostat: Fix offset overflow issue in index convertingThe idx_to_offset() function returns type int (32-bit signed), butMSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative number.The end result is that it hits the if (offset < 0) check inupdate_msr_sum()which prevents the timer callback from updating the stat in the backgroundwhenlong durations are used. The similar issue exists in offset_to_idx() andupdate_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by converting the 'int' to 'off_t'accordingly.",
