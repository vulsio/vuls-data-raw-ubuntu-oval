		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directlyCurrently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directlywithout holding 'reconfig_mutex', this is definitely unsafe becausemd_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by'reconfig_mutex'.However, hold 'reconfig_mutex' here is still problematic because thiswill cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b (\"md: refactoridle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock\").Fix this problem by using stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread,like md/raid did.",
