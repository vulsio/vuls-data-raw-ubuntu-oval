		"description": "A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists incurl <v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality to behave incorrectlywhen multiple URLs are requested in parallel. Using its HSTS support, curlcan be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTPstep even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism wouldhowever surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done in parallel asthe HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recentlycompletedtransfer. A later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then*not* get upgraded properly to HSTS.",
