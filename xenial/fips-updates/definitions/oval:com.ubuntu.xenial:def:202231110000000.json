    "Title": "CVE-2022-3111 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16-rc6. free_charger_irq() in drivers/power/supply/wm8350_power.c lacks free of WM8350_IRQ_CHG_FAST_RDY, which is registered in wm8350_init_charger(). Jiasheng Jiang discovered that the wm8350 charger driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
