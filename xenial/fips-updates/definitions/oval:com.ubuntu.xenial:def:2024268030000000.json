		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:veth: clear GRO when clearing XDP even when down veth sets NETIF_F_GROautomatically when XDP is enabled, because both features use the same NAPImachinery. The logic to clear NETIF_F_GRO sits in veth_disable_xdp() whichis called both on ndo_stop and when XDP is turned off. To avoid the flagfrom being cleared when the device is brought down, the clearing is skippedwhen IFF_UP is not set. Bringing the device down should indeed not modifyits features. Unfortunately, this means that clearing is also skipped whenXDP is disabled _while_ the device is down. And there's nothing on the openpath to bring the device features back into sync. IOW if user enables XDP,disables it and then brings the device up we'll end up with a stray GROflag set but no NAPI instances. We don't depend on the GRO flag on thedatapath, so the datapath won't crash. We will crash (or hang), however,next time features are sync'ed (either by user via ethtool or peer changingits config). The GRO flag will go away, and veth will try to disable theNAPIs. But the open path never created them since XDP was off, the GRO flagwas a stray. If NAPI was initialized before we'll hang in napi_disable().If it never was we'll crash trying to stop uninitialized hrtimer. Move theGRO flag updates to the XDP enable / disable paths, instead of mixing themwith the ndo_open / ndo_close paths.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26803` to fix the vulnerability.
