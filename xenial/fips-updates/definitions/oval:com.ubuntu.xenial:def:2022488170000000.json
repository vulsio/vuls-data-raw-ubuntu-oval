		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: dsa: ar9331: register the mdiobus under devresAs explained in commits:74b6d7d13307 (\"net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres\")5135e96a3dd2 (\"net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres\")mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus wasnot previously unregistered.The ar9331 is an MDIO device, so the initial set of constraints that Ithought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call ->remove on->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which applies here.If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device linkbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()will unbind the ar9331 switch driver on shutdown.So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, whichis: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,or don't use devres at all.The ar9331 driver doesn't have a complex code structure for mdiobusremoval, so just replace of_mdiobus_register with the devres variant inorder to be all-devres and ensure that we don't free a still-registeredbus.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48817` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
