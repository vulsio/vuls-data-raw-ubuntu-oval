When theax25 device is shutting down, the ax25_dev_device_down() drops thereference count of net_device one or zero times depending on if we gotounlock_put or not, which will cause memory leak. In order to solve theabove issue, decrease the reference count of net_device after dev->ax25_ptris set to null.",
