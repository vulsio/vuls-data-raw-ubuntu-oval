    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in net/sched/cls_fw.c in classifiers (cls_fw, cls_u32, and cls_route) in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to perform a local privilege escalation due to incorrect handling of the existing filter, leading to a kernel information leak issue. It was discovered that some network classifier implementations in the Linux kernel contained use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
