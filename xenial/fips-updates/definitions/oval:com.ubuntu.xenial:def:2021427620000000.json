		"description": "BubblewrapLauncher.cpp in WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1 allows alimited sandbox bypass that allows a sandboxed process to trick hostprocesses into thinking the sandboxed process is not confined by thesandbox, by abusing VFS syscalls that manipulate its filesystem namespace.The impact is limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that WebKitmounts inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwiseconfined. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.",
