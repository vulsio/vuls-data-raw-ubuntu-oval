		"title": "CVE-2020-26558 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify thePasskey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) byreflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of theinitiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to completeauthenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkeyfor the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkeyvalue one bit at a time.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26558` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1069-fips - 4.4.0-1069.75\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1069-fips - 4.4.0-1069.75\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1069-fips - 4.4.0-1069.75\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1069-fips - 4.4.0-1069.75\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
