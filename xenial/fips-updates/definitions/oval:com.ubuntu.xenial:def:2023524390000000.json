But after core-1device_unregister, put_device and before doing kfree, the core-2 mayget_device. Then:1. After core-1 kfree idev, the core-2 will do use-after-free for idev.2. When core-2 do uio_release and put_device, the idev will be double   freed.To address this issue, we can get idev atomic & inc idev reference withminor_lock.",
