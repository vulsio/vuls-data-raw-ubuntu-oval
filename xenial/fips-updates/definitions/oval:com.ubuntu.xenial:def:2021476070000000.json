		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic cmpxchg's r0 aux regThe implementation of BPF_CMPXCHG on a high level has the followingparameters:  .-[old-val]                                          .-[new-val]  BPF_R0 = cmpxchg{32,64}(DST_REG + insn->off, BPF_R0, SRC_REG)                          `-[mem-loc]          `-[old-val]Given a BPF insn can only have two registers (dst, src), the R0 is fixedandused as an auxilliary register for input (old value) as well as output(returningold value from memory location). While the verifier performs a number ofsafetychecks, it misses to reject unprivileged programs where R0 contains apointer asold value.Through brute-forcing it takes about ~16sec on my machine to leak a kernelpointerwith BPF_CMPXCHG. The PoC is basically probing for kernel addresses bystoring theguessed address into the map slot as a scalar, and using the map valuepointer asR0 while SRC_REG has a canary value to detect a matching address.Fix it by checking R0 for pointers, and reject if that's the case forunprivilegedprograms.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47607` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
