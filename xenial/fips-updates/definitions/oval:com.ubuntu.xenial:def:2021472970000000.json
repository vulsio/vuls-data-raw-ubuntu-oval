		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix uninit-value in caif_seqpkt_sendmsg When nr_segs equal to zero iniovec_from_user, the object msg->msg_iter.iov is uninit stack memory incaif_seqpkt_sendmsg which is defined in ___sys_sendmsg. So we cann't justjudge msg->msg_iter.iov->base directlly. We can use nr_segs to judge msg incaif_seqpkt_sendmsg whether has data buffers.===================================================== BUG: KMSAN:uninit-value in caif_seqpkt_sendmsg+0x693/0xf60 net/caif/caif_socket.c:542Call Trace: __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:77 [inline]dump_stack+0x1c9/0x220 lib/dump_stack.c:118 kmsan_report+0xf7/0x1e0mm/kmsan/kmsan_report.c:118 __msan_warning+0x58/0xa0mm/kmsan/kmsan_instr.c:215 caif_seqpkt_sendmsg+0x693/0xf60net/caif/caif_socket.c:542 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:652 [inline]sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:672 [inline] ____sys_sendmsg+0x12b6/0x1350net/socket.c:2343 ___sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2397 [inline]__sys_sendmmsg+0x808/0xc90 net/socket.c:2480 __compat_sys_sendmmsgnet/compat.c:656 [inline]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47297` to fix the vulnerability.
