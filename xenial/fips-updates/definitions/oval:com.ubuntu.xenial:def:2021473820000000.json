An error path was missed though, that still takesdiscipline_mutex and thus has the original deadlock potential.Intermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channel path is configuredoffline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset and ccwgroup_remove.Call qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset() error case andthen a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without takingdiscipline_mutex.",
