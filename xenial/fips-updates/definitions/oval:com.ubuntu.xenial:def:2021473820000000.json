		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/qeth: fix deadlock during failing recovery Commit 0b9902c1fcc5(\"s390/qeth: fix deadlock during recovery\") removed taking discipline_mutexinside qeth_do_reset(), fixing potential deadlocks. An error path wasmissed though, that still takes discipline_mutex and thus has the originaldeadlock potential. Intermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channelpath is configured offline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset andccwgroup_remove. Call qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset()error case and then a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without takingdiscipline_mutex.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47382` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
