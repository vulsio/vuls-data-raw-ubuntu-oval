This issue only affects users that use Watcher and havea Watch defined that uses the search input and additionally have set thesearch inputâ€™s logger to DEBUG or finer, for example using:org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input.search,org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher, orwider, since the loggers are hierarchical.",
