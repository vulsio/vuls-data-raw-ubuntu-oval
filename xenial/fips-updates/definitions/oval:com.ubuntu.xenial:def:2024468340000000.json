		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ethtool: fail closed if we can't get max channel used in indirection tablesCommit 0d1b7d6c9274 (\"bnxt: fix crashes when reducing ring count withactive RSS contexts\") proves that allowing indirection table to containchannels with out of bounds IDs may lead to crashes. Currently themax channel check in the core gets skipped if driver can't fetchthe indirection table or when we can't allocate memory.Both of those conditions should be extremely rare but if they dohappen we should try to be safe and fail the channel change.",
