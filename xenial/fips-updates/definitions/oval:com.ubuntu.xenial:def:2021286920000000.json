		"description": "inappropriate x86 IOMMU timeout detection / handling IOMMUs processcommands issued to them in parallel with the operation of the CPU(s)issuing such commands. In the current implementation in Xen, asynchronousnotification of the completion of such commands is not used. Instead, theissuing CPU spin-waits for the completion of the most recently issuedcommand(s). Some of these waiting loops try to apply a timeout to failoverly-slow commands. The course of action upon a perceived timeoutactually being detected is inappropriate: - on Intel hardware guests whichdid not originally cause the timeout may be marked as crashed, - on AMDhardware higher layer callers would not be notified of the issue, makingthem continue as if the IOMMU operation succeeded.",
