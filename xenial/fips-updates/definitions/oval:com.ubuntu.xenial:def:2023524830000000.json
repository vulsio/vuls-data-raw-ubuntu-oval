		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mctp: perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lockOur current route lookups (mctp_route_lookup and mctp_route_lookup_null)traverse the net's route list without the RCU read lock held. This meansthe route lookup is subject to preemption, resulting in an potentialgrace period expiry, and so an eventual kfree() while we still have theroute pointer.Add the proper read-side critical section locks around the routelookups, preventing premption and a possible parallel kfree.The remaining net->mctp.routes accesses are already under arcu_read_lock, or protected by the RTNL for updates.Based on an analysis from Sili Luo <rootlab@huawei.com>, whereintroducing a delay in the route lookup could cause a UAF onsimultaneous sendmsg() and route deletion.",
