		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mctp:perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lock Our current route lookups(mctp_route_lookup and mctp_route_lookup_null) traverse the net's routelist without the RCU read lock held. This means the route lookup is subjectto preemption, resulting in an potential grace period expiry, and so aneventual kfree() while we still have the route pointer. Add the properread-side critical section locks around the route lookups, preventingpremption and a possible parallel kfree. The remaining net->mctp.routesaccesses are already under a rcu_read_lock, or protected by the RTNL forupdates. Based on an analysis from Sili Luo <rootlab@huawei.com>, whereintroducing a delay in the route lookup could cause a UAF on simultaneoussendmsg() and route deletion.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52483` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
