		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:Avoid crash from unnecessary IDA free In the remove path, there is anattempt to free the aux_idx IDA whether it was allocated or not. This canpotentially cause a crash when unloading the driver on systems that do notinitialize support for RDMA. But, this free cannot be gated by the statusbit for RDMA, since it is allocated if the driver detects support for RDMAat probe time, but the driver can enter into a state where RDMA is notsupported after the IDA has been allocated at probe time and this wouldlead to a memory leak. Initialize aux_idx to an invalid value and check fora valid value when unloading to determine if an IDA free is necessary.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47453` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
