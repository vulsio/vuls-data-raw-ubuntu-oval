		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages() There are reports from tree-checkerthat detects corrupted nodes, without any obvious pattern so possibly anoverwrite in memory. After some debugging it turns out there's a race whenreading an extent buffer the uptodate status can be missed. To preventconcurrent reads for the same extent buffer, read_extent_buffer_pages()performs these checks: /* (1) */ if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE,&eb->bflags)) return 0; /* (2) */ if(test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags)) goto done; At thispoint, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Once thatcompletes, end_bbio_meta_read() does /* (3) */set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb); /* (4) */ clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING,&eb->bflags); Normally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, andall other callers wait for it to finish before returning. Unfortunately,there is a racey interleaving: Thread A | Thread B | Thread C---------+----------+--------- (1) | | | (1) | (2) | | (3) | | (4) | | |(2) | | | (1) When this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read.Worse, thread C will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while theread from thread B is still in progress. This race could result intree-checker errors like this as the extent buffer is concurrentlymodified: BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356 expect[256, 18446744073709551360] Fix it by testing UPTODATE again after settingthe READING bit, and if it's been set, skip the unnecessary read.
