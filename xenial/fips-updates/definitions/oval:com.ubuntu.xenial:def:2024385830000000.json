		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix use-after-free of timer for log writer threadPatch series \"nilfs2: fix log writer related issues\".This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 log writer-related issues,including a timer use-after-free issue and potential deadlock issue onunmount, and a potential freeze issue in event synchronization foundduring their analysis.  Details are described in each commit log.This patch (of 3):A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer onthe nilfs_sc_info structure.The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping logwriter thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structureis about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime.Fix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writerthread is alive.",
