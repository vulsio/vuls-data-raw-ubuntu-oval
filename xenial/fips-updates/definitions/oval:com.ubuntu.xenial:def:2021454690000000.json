		"Title": "CVE-2021-45469 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. Wenqing Liu discovered that the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the last xattr entry in an inode. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-45469` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
