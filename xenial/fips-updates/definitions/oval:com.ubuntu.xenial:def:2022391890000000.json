		"Title": "CVE-2022-39189 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered the x86 KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.18.17. Unprivileged guest users can compromise the guest kernel because TLB flush operations are mishandled in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations. Jann Horn discovered that the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle TLB flush operations in some situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the guest kernel.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39189` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
