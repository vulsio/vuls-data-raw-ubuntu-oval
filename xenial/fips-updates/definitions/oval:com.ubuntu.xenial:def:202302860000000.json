		"title": "CVE-2023-0286 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high",
		"description": "There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 addressprocessing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as anASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAMEincorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. Thisfield is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmpas an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled(i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), thisvulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmpcall, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service.In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both thecertificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature.If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input mustalready contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which isuncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affectapplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrievingCRLs over a network.",
