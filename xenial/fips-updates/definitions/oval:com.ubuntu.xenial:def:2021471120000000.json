		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/kvm: Teardown PV features on boot CPU as wellVarious PV features (Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through memoryshared with hypervisor and when we restore from hibernation we mustproperly teardown all these features to make sure hypervisor doesn'twrite to stale locations after we jump to the previously hibernated kernel(which can try to place anything there). For secondary CPUs the job isalready done by kvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to dothe same for boot CPU.",
