		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:remoteproc: mediatek: Make sure IPI buffer fits in L2TCM The IPI bufferlocation is read from the firmware that we load to the System CompanionProcessor, and it's not granted that both the SRAM (L2TCM) size that isdefined in the devicetree node is large enough for that, and while this isespecially true for multi-core SCP, it's still useful to check onsingle-core variants as well. Failing to perform this check may make thisdriver perform R/W operations out of the L2TCM boundary, resulting (atbest) in a kernel panic. To fix that, check that the IPI buffer fits,otherwise return a failure and refuse to boot the relevant SCP core (or theSCP at all, if this is single core).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36965` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
