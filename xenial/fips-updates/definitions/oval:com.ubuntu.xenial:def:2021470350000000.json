		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entriesWhen the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it onlysupports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permissionis not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) shouldalways set. When using second level, we still give separate permissionsthat allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want tohave consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want thingsto work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.Hence remove this configuration.",
