		"Title": "CVE-2022-1205 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Amateur Radio AX.25 protocol functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
