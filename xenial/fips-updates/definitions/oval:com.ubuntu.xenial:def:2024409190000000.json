This issue isexpected to be prevented by HWRM_ERR_CODE_PF_UNAVAILABLE error code. Butthis error code is returned by recent firmware. So some firmware may notreturn it. This may lead to NULL pointer dereference.Adjust this issue by adding token pointer check.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
