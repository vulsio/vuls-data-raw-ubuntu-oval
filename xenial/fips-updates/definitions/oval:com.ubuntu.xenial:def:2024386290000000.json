		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida file_ida isallocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly during cdev release.This sequence is guaranteed by driver file operations. Therefore, there isno need to destroy an already empty file_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.Worse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of file_idaper WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida after it has beendestroyed, resulting in a kernel panic. Remove ida_destroy(&file_ida) toaddress these issues.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38629` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
