Note that this occurs aftercertificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to havesigned a malicious certificate or for an application to continuecertificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trustedissuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate tooverflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing adenial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting toa malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the serverrequests client authentication and a malicious client connects.",
