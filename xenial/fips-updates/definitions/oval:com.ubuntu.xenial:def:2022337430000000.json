		"Title": "CVE-2022-33743 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "network backend may cause Linux netfront to use freed SKBs While adding logic to support XDP (eXpress Data Path), a code label was moved in a way allowing for SKBs having references (pointers) retained for further processing to nevertheless be freed. Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen network device frontend driver in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled socket buffers (skb) references when communicating with certain backends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33743` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1083-fips - 4.4.0-1083.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
