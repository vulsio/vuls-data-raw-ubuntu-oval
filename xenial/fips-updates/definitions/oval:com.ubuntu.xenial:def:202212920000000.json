		"Title": "CVE-2022-1292 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters toprevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operatingsystems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operatingsystems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privilegesof the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and shouldbe replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3(Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected1.1.1-1.1.1n). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1292` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.3\nlibssl1.0.0-hmac - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.3\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
