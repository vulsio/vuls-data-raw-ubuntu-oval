		"Note": "tyhicks> See test case in the bug no fix upstream as of 2016-09-09 sbeattie> patch committed upstream on 2016-12-31; renames symbol so backporting may not be easy. commit included in glibc 2.25 release debian fixed this in unstable in 2.24-9 fixing this does indeed break the internal ABI between libnss_dns and libresolv. We're backing out this change. reverted from zesty in 2.24-9ubuntu2 by infinity. For existing releases, DO NOT APPLY THIS PATCH due to ABI breakage. Fix will come in to 17.10 when we get glibc-2.25 as we do not guarantee ABI for libresolv internals across different glibc releases, just for upgrades for same versions e.g. (2.24 -> 2.24) REPEAT: DO NOT APPLY THIS PATCH (UNMODIFIED) IN A STABLE RELEASE mdeslaur> marking this issue as ignored, as we will not be fixing this in Ubuntu stable releases."
