		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nsh:Restore skb->{protocol,data,mac_header} for outer header innsh_gso_segment(). syzbot triggered various splats (see [0] and links) by acrafted GSO packet of VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP layering the followingprotocols: ETH_P_8021AD + ETH_P_NSH + ETH_P_IPV6 + IPPROTO_UDP NSH canencapsulate IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, NSH, and MPLS. As the inner protocol canbe Ethernet, NSH GSO handler, nsh_gso_segment(), callsskb_mac_gso_segment() to invoke inner protocol GSO handlers.nsh_gso_segment() does the following for the original skb before callingskb_mac_gso_segment() 1. reset skb->network_header 2. save the originalskb->{mac_heaeder,mac_len} in a local variable 3. pull the NSH header 4.resets skb->mac_header 5. set up skb->mac_len and skb->protocol for theinner protocol. and does the following for the segmented skb 6. setntohs(ETH_P_NSH) to skb->protocol 7. push the NSH header 8. restoreskb->mac_header 9. set skb->mac_header + mac_len to skb->network_header 10.restore skb->mac_len There are two problems in 6-7 and 8-9. (a) After 6 &7, skb->data points to the NSH header, so the outer header (ETH_P_8021AD inthis case) is stripped when skb is sent out of netdev. Also, if NSH isencapsulated by NSH + Ethernet (so NSH-Ethernet-NSH), skb_pull() in thefirst nsh_gso_segment() will make skb->data point to the middle of theouter NSH or Ethernet header because the Ethernet header is not pulled bythe second nsh_gso_segment(). (b) While restoringskb->{mac_header,network_header} in 8 & 9, nsh_gso_segment() does notassume that the data in the linear buffer is shifted. However,udp6_ufo_fragment() could shift the data and change skb->mac_headeraccordingly as demonstrated by syzbot. If this happens, even the restoredskb->mac_header points to the middle of the outer header. It seemsnsh_gso_segment() has never worked with outer headers so far. At the end ofnsh_gso_segment(), the outer header must be restored for the segmented skb,instead of the NSH header. To do that, let's calculate the outer headerposition relatively from the inner header and setskb->{data,mac_header,protocol} properly.
