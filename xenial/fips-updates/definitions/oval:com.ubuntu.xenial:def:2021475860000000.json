		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:stmmac: dwmac-rk: fix oob read in rk_gmac_setup KASAN reports anout-of-bounds read in rk_gmac_setup on the line: while (ops->regs[i]) {This happens for most platforms since the regs flexible array member isempty, so the memory after the ops structure is being read here. It seemsthat mostly this happens to contain zero anyway, so we get lucky andeverything still works. To avoid adding redundant data to nearly all theops structures, add a new flag to indicate whether the regs field is validand avoid this loop when it is not.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47586` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
