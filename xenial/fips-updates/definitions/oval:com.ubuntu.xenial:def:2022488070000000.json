		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handlerCurrently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFOLAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This iscausing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed hasa different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problemmanifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that onlyis passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for theNETDEV_UNREGISTER event.Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdevand related braces.",
