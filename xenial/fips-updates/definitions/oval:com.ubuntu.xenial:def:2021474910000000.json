		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:khugepaged: skip huge page collapse for special files The read-only THP forfilesystems will collapse THP for files opened readonly and mapped withVM_EXEC. The intended usecase is to avoid TLB misses for large textsegments. But it doesn't restrict the file types so a THP could becollapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block device, if it isopened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission. This may cause bugs, like[1] and [2]. This is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapseTHP for regular files in order to close the attack surface.[shy828301@gmail.com: fix vm_file check [3]]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47491` to fix the vulnerability.
