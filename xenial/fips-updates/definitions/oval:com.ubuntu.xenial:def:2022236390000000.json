		"description": "crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scopedthreads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust.crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that thealignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, thealignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than`Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race.Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected bythis issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets arenot affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7.There are currently no known workarounds.",
