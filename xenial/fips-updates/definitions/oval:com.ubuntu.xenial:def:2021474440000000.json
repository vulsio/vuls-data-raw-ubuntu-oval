		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/edid: In connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks read Incommit e11f5bd8228f (\"drm: Add support for DP 1.4 Compliance edidcorruption test\") the function connector_bad_edid() started assuming thatthe memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold `edid[0x7e] +1` blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). It completely ignored thefact that the function was passed `num_blocks` which indicated how muchmemory had been allocated for the EDID. Let's fix this by adding a boundscheck. This is important for handling the case where there's an error inthe first block of the EDID. In that case we will call connector_bad_edid()without having re-allocated memory based on `edid[0x7e]`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47444` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
