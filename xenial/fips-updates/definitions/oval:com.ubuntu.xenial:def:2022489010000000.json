		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: do not start relocation until in progress drops are doneWe hit a bug with a recovering relocation on mount for one of our filesystems in production.  I reproduced this locally by injecting errorsinto snapshot delete with balance running at the same time.

However if we had apending balance waiting to get the ->cleaner_mutex, and a snapshotdeletion was running, and then the box crashed, we would come up in astate where we have a half deleted snapshot.Again, in the normal case the snapshot deletion needs to complete beforerelocation can start, but in this case relocation could very well startbefore the snapshot deletion completes, as we simply add the root to thedead roots list and wait for the next time the cleaner runs to clean upthe snapshot.Fix this by setting a bit on the fs_info if we have any DEAD_ROOT's thathad a pending drop_progress key.  If they do then we know we were in themiddle of the drop operation and set a flag on the fs_info.  Thenbalance can wait until this flag is cleared to start up again.If there are DEAD_ROOT's that don't have a drop_progress set then we'resafe to start balance right away as we'll be properly protected by thecleaner_mutex.",
