		"Title": "CVE-2022-24122 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "kernel/ucount.c in the Linux kernel 5.14 through 5.16.4, when unprivileged user namespaces are enabled, allows a use-after-free and privilege escalation because a ucounts object can outlive its namespace. It was discovered that the rlimit tracking for user namespaces in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24122` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
