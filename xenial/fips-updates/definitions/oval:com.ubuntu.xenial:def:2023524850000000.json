		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before sending a command [Why] We can hang inplace trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't powered on. [How] Forfunctions that execute within a DC context or DC lock we can wrap thedirect calls to dm_execute_dmub_cmd/list with code that exits idle poweroptimizations and reallows once we're done with the command submission onsuccess. For DM direct submissions the DM will need to manage theenter/exit sequencing manually. We cannot invoke a DMCUB command directlywithin the DM execution helper or we can deadlock.",
