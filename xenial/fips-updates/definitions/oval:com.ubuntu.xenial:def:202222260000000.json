		"Title": "CVE-2022-2226 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when thesignature was created. When displaying an email that contains a digitalsignature, the email's date will be shown. If the dates were different,then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an invalid signature. Ifan attacker performed a replay attack, in which an old email with oldcontents are resent at a later time, it could lead the victim to believethat the statements in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbirdwill require that the signature's date roughly matches the displayed dateof the email. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102 and Thunderbird< 91.11.",
