		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bus:mhi: pci_generic: Fix possible use-after-free in mhi_pci_remove() Thisdriver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function does notwait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the timer handlermay still be running after the driver's remove function has finished, whichwould result in a use-after-free. Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), whichmakes sure the timer handler has finished, and unable to re-scheduleitself.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47278` to fix the vulnerability.
