		"description": "A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection,curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password withthe existing connections. This means that if an unused connection withproper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scopedcredentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/heknows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-8616` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2\nlibcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.2\nNo subscription required",
