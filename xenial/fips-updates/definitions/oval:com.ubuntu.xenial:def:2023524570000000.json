		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial: 8250: omap: Don't skip resource freeing ifpm_runtime_resume_and_get() failedReturning an error code from .remove() makes the driver core emit thelittle helpful error message:\tremove callback returned a non-zero value. This will be ignored.and then remove the device anyhow. So all resources that were not freedare leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port() has thepotential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-free.So replace the error return (and with it the little helpful errormessage) by a more useful error message and continue to cleanup.",
