		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dpll: fix pin dump crash for rebound moduleWhen a kernel module is unbound but the pin resources were not entirelyfreed (other kernel module instance of the same PCI device have had keptthe reference to that pin), and kernel module is again bound, the pinproperties would not be updated (the properties are only assigned whenmemory for the pin is allocated), prop pointer still points to thekernel module memory of the kernel module which was deallocated on theunbind.If the pin dump is invoked in this state, the result is a kernel crash.Prevent the crash by storing persistent pin properties in dpll subsystem,copy the content from the kernel module when pin is allocated, instead ofusing memory of the kernel module.",
