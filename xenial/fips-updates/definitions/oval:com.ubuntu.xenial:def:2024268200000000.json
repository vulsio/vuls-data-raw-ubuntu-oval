		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hv_netvsc: Register VF in netvsc_probe if NET_DEVICE_REGISTER missed Ifhv_netvsc driver is unloaded and reloaded, the NET_DEVICE_REGISTER handlercannot perform VF register successfully as the register call is receivedbefore netvsc_probe is finished. This is because we registerregister_netdevice_notifier() very early( even beforevmbus_driver_register()). To fix this, we try to register each suchmatching VF( if it is visible as a netdevice) at the end of netvsc_probe.",
