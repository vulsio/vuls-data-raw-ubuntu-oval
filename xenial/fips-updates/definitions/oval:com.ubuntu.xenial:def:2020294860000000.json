Any guest can run another guest out ofquota, or create an unbounded number of nodes owned by dom0, thus runningxenstored out of memory A malicious guest administrator can cause a denialof service against a specific guest or against the whole host. All systemsusing oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is thedefault in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler isavailable.
