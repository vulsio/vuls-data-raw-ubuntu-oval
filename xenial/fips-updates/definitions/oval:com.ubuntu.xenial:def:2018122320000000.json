		"Title": "CVE-2018-12232 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "In net/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, there is a race condition between fchownat and close in cases where they target the same socket file descriptor, related to the sock_close and sockfs_setattr functions. fchownat does not increment the file descriptor reference count, which allows close to set the socket to NULL during fchownat's execution, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash. Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-12232` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-azure - 4.15.0-1022.22~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-gcp - 4.15.0-1018.19~16.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-generic - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-33-lowlatency - 4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
