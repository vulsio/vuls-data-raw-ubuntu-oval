		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: PCI:switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove A PCI devicehot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call tostdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way pastswitchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with thetrailing put_device(), just before return. At that later point in time, thedevm cleanup has already removed the stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, thestdev->pdev reference was not a counted one. Therefore, in DMA mode, theiowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause a fatal page fault, and thesubsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached, would pass a stale&stdev->pdev->dev pointer. Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown intoswitchtec_pci_remove(), after stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref isnow optional, but may prevent future accidents. Reproducible via the scriptat https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231113212150.96410-1-dns@arista.com",
