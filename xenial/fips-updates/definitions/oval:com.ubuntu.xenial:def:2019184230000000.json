		"Title": "CVE-2019-18423 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS usersto cause a denial of service via a XENMEM_add_to_physmap hypercall.p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by the functionsp2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check guestphysical frame. The rest of the code in the two functions will assume thatthere is a valid root table and check that with BUG_ON(). The functionp2m_get_root_pointer() will ignore the unused top bits of a guest physicalframe. This means that the function p2m_set_entry() will alias the frame.However, p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated using the original frame. Itwould be possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a framethat would lead p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL in p2m_get_entry()and p2m_resolve_translation_fault(). Additionally, the sanity check onp2m->max_mapped_gfn is off-by-one allowing \"highest mapped + 1\" to beconsidered valid. However, p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL. Theproblem could be triggered with a specially crafted hypercallXENMEM_add_to_physmap{, _batch} followed by an access to an address (viahypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but causep2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL. A malicious guest administrator maycause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Xenversion 4.8 and newer are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86systems are not affected.",
