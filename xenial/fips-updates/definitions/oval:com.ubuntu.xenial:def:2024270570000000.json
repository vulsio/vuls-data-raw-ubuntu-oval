		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ASoC:SOF: ipc4-pcm: Workaround for crashed firmware on system suspend When thesystem is suspended while audio is active, the sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() isinvoked to reset the pipelines since during suspend the DSP is turned off,streams will be re-started after resume. If the firmware crashes duringwhile audio is running (or when we reset the stream before suspend) thenthe sof_ipc4_set_multi_pipeline_state() will fail with IPC error and thestate change is interrupted. This will cause misalignment between thekernel and firmware state on next DSP boot resulting errors returned byfirmware for IPC messages, eventually failing the audio resume. On streamclose the errors are ignored so the kernel state will be corrected on thenext DSP boot, so the second boot after the DSP panic. Ifsof_ipc4_trigger_pipelines() is called from sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() thenstate parameter is SOF_IPC4_PIPE_RESET and only in this case. Treat aforced pipeline reset similarly to how we treat a pcm_free by ignoringerror on state sending to allow the kernel's state to be consistent withthe state the firmware will have after the next boot.",
