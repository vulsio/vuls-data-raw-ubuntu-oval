		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix potential use after free in nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data() Innilfs_gccache_submit_read_data(), brelse(bh) is called to drop thereference count of bh when the call to nilfs_dat_translate() fails. If thereference count hits 0 and its owner page gets unlocked, bh may be freed.However, bh->b_page is dereferenced to put the page after that, which mayresult in a use-after-free bug. This patch moves the release operationafter unlocking and putting the page. NOTE: The function in question isonly called in GC, and in combination with current userland tools, addresstranslation using DAT does not occur in that function, so the code paththat causes this issue will not be executed. However, it is possible to runthat code path by intentionally modifying the userland GC library or bycalling the GC ioctl directly. [konishi.ryusuke@gmail.com: NOTE added tothe commit log]",
