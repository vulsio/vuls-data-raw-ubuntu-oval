		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af_unix component canbe exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Theunix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in thepeer's recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race whereunix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is beingreleased by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free. We recommendupgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4622` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
