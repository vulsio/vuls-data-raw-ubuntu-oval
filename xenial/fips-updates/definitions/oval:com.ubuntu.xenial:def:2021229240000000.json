		"description": "libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool forsubsequenttransfers to reuse, if one of them matches the setup.Due toerrors in the logic, the config matching function did not take 'issuercert'into account and it compared the involved paths *case insensitively*,whichcould lead to libcurl reusing wrong connections.File paths are, or can be,case sensitive on many systems but not all, and caneven vary depending onused file systems.The comparison also didn't include the 'issuer cert'which a transfer can setto qualify how to verify the server certificate.",
