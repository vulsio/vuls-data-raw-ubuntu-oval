		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:watchdog: Fix possible use-after-free in wdt_startup() This module's removepath calls del_timer(). However, that function does not wait until thetimer handler finishes. This means that the timer handler may still berunning after the driver's remove function has finished, which would resultin a use-after-free. Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure thetimer handler has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
