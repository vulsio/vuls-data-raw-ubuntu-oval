However, that functiondoes not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that thetimer handler may still be running after the driver's remove functionhas finished, which would result in a use-after-free.Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handlerhas finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
