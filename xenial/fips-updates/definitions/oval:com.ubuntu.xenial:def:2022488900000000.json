		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VMstorvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather list using scsi_dma_map(),which in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If the I/Osubmission fails in storvsc_do_io(), the I/O is typically retried by higherlevel code, but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly likecause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer, whichis not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffermemory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problemcan arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameterswiotlb=force.Fix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submissionerror, which frees the bounce buffer memory.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48890` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
