		"description": "In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check thedestination of symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format is asquashfs file-system image and so can contain symbolic links and other filetypes. Various file entries within the snap squashfs image (such as iconsand desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. Anattacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap whichcontained symbolic links at these paths could then cause snapd to write outthe contents of the symbolic link destination into a world-readabledirectory. This in-turn could allow an unprivileged user to gain access toprivileged information.",
