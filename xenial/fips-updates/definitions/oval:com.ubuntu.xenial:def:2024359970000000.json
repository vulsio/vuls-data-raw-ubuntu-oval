		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-upThe flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations.However, this is not necessary, because I2C core already has its ownlocking for that.More importantly, this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set ini2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens, the interrupt handler(i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doinganything, then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in aninfinite loop.Since interrupt handler is an RT task, it takes over the CPU and theflag-clearing task never gets scheduled, thus we have a lock-up.Delete this unnecessary flag.",
