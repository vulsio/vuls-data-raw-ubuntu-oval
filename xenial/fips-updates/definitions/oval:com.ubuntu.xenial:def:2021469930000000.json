		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sched:Fix out-of-bound access in uclamp Util-clamp places tasks in differentbuckets based on their clamp values for performance reasons. However, thesize of buckets is currently computed using a rounding division, which canlead to an off-by-one error in some configurations. For instance, with 20buckets, the bucket size will be 1024/20=51. A task with a clamp of 1024will be mapped to bucket id 1024/51=20. Sadly, correct indexes are in range[0,19], hence leading to an out of bound memory access. Clamp the bucket idto fix the issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46993` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
