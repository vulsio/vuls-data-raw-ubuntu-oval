		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Input:appletouch - initialize work before device registration Syzbot has reportedwarning in __flush_work(). This warning is caused by work->func == NULL,which means missing work initialization. This may happen, sinceinput_dev->close() calls cancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->workinitalization happens _after_ input_register_device() call. So this patchmoves dev->work initialization before registering input device",
