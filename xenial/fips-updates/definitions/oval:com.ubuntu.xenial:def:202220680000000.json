		"description": "In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified inCVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does notproperly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection werefound by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was notdiscovered that there are other places in the script where the file namesof certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executedthrough the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems ina manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, anattacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of thescript. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should bereplaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4(Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2068` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.3\nlibssl1.0.0-hmac - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.3\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.fips.4.20.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
