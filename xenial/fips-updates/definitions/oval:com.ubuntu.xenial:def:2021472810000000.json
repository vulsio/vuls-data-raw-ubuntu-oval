		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open() The timer instance per queue isexclusive, and snd_seq_timer_open() should have managed the concurrentaccesses. It looks as if it's checking the already existing timer instanceat the beginning, but it's not right, because there is no protection, henceany later concurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timerinstance easily. This may result in UAF, as the leftover timer instance cankeep running while the queue itself gets closed, as spotted by syzkallerrecently. For avoiding the race, add a proper check at the assignment oftmr->timeri again, and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.",
