		"Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova 15.x through 15.1.0 and 16.xthrough 16.1.1. By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume, anattacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS header,resulting in a denial of service attack on the compute host. (The same codeerror also results in data loss, but that is not a vulnerability becausethe user loses their own data.) All Nova setups supporting encryptedvolumes are affected.",
