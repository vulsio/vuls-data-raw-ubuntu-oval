		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sfc:fix null pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit Trying to get thechannel from the tx_queue variable here is wrong because we can only behere if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn't dereference it. As the abovecomment in the code says, this is very unlikely to happen, but it's wronganyway so let's fix it. I hit this issue because of a different bug thatcaused tx_queue to be NULL. If that happens, this is the error message thatwe get here: BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at0000000000000020 [...] RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]",
