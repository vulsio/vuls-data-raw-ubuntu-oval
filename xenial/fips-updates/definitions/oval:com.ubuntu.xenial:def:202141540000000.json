    "Title": "CVE-2021-4154 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in cgroup1_parse_param in kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c in the Linux kernel's cgroup v1 parser. A local attacker with a user privilege could cause a privilege escalation by exploiting the fsconfig syscall parameter leading to a container breakout and a denial of service on the system.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4154` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1074-fips - 4.4.0-1074.80\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
