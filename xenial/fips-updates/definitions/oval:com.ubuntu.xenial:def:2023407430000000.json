		"Description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in anapplication, it may not have been obvious that looking up a service through\"ServiceFactory.getService\" allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanismssuch as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method, this couldexpose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE. AsAxis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine,such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code toverify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to\"ServiceFactory.getService\", or by applying the patch fromhttps://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x releasefixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towardsthis are welcome.",
