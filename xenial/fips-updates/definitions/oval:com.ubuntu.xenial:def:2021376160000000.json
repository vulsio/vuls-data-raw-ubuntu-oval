		"description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A null pointerdereference was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The nullpointer dereference is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadataof a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit thevulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victiminto running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is onlytriggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which is a lessfrequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option(`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.",
