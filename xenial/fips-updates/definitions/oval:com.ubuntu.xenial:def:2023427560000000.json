		"Title": "CVE-2023-42756 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A race condition between IPSET_CMD_ADD and IPSET_CMD_SWAP can lead to a kernel panic due to the invocation of `__ip_set_put` on a wrong `set`. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system. Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in IP set operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
