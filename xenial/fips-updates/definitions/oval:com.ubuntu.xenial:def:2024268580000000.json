		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Use a memory barrier to enforce PTP WQ xmit submission trackingoccurs after populating the metadata_map Just simply reordering thefunctions mlx5e_ptp_metadata_map_put and mlx5e_ptpsq_track_metadata in themlx5e_txwqe_complete context is not good enough since both the compiler andCPU are free to reorder these two functions. If reordering does occur, theissue that was supposedly fixed by 7e3f3ba97e6c (\"net/mlx5e: Track xmitsubmission to PTP WQ after populating metadata map\") will be seen. Thiswill lead to NULL pointer dereferences inmlx5e_ptpsq_mark_ts_cqes_undelivered in the NAPI polling context due to thetracking list being populated before the metadata map.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26858` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
