		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second refError injection stress uncovered a problem where we'd leave a danglinginode ref if we failed during a rename_exchange.  This happens becausewe insert the inode ref for one side of the rename, and then for theother side.  If this second inode ref insert fails we'll leave the firstone dangling and leave a corrupt file system behind.  Fix this byaborting if we did the insert for the first inode ref.",
