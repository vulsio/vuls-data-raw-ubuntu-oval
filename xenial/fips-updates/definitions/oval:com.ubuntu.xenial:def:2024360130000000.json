		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free in l2cap_connect() Extend acritical section to prevent chan from early freeing. Also make thel2cap_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the returned value butit is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer. Making it void will helpwith backports because earlier kernels did use the return value. Now thecompile will break for kernels where this patch is not a complete fix.
