		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc(HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve localprivilege escalation. If a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with theHFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, theninit_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() willbe skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause ause-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commitb3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.",
