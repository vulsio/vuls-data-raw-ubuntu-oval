		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy A failingusercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in the filedescriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This enables userlandto refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still valid filedescriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free exploitation scenarios.Fix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopy hassucceeded.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48771` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-4.4.0-2-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-2-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1004-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
