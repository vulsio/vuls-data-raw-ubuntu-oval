		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracefs: Reset permissions on remount if permissions are options There's aninconsistency with the way permissions are handled in tracefs. Because thepermissions are generated when accessed, they default to the root inode'spermission if they were never set by the user. If the user sets thepermissions, then a flag is set and the permissions are saved via the inode(for tracefs files) or an internal attribute field (for eventfs). But if aremount happens that specify the permissions, all the files that were notchanged by the user gets updated, but the ones that were are not. If theuser were to remount the file system with a given permission, then allfiles and directories within that file system should be updated. This cancause security issues if a file's permission was updated but the adminforgot about it. They could incorrectly think that remounting withpermissions set would update all files, but miss some. For example: # cd/sys/kernel/tracing # chgrp 1002 current_tracer # ls -l [..] -rw-r----- 1root root 0 May 1 21:25 buffer_size_kb -rw-r----- 1 root root 0 May 1 21:25buffer_subbuf_size_kb -r--r----- 1 root root 0 May 1 21:25buffer_total_size_kb -rw-r----- 1 root lkp 0 May 1 21:25 current_tracer-rw-r----- 1 root root 0 May 1 21:25 dynamic_events -r--r----- 1 root root0 May 1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info -r--r----- 1 root root 0 May 1 21:25enabled_functions Where current_tracer now has group \"lkp\". # mount -oremount,gid=1001 . # ls -l -rw-r----- 1 root tracing 0 May 1 21:25buffer_size_kb -rw-r----- 1 root tracing 0 May 1 21:25buffer_subbuf_size_kb -r--r----- 1 root tracing 0 May 1 21:25buffer_total_size_kb -rw-r----- 1 root lkp 0 May 1 21:25 current_tracer-rw-r----- 1 root tracing 0 May 1 21:25 dynamic_events -r--r----- 1 roottracing 0 May 1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info -r--r----- 1 root tracing 0 May1 21:25 enabled_functions Everything changed but the \"current_tracer\". Adda new link list that keeps track of all the tracefs_inodes which has thepermission flags that tell if the file/dir should use the root inode'spermission or not. Then on remount, clear all the flags so that the defaultbehavior of using the root inode's permission is done for all files anddirectories.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36963` to fix the vulnerability.
