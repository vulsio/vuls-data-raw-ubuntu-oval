		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i2c: virtio: fix completion handlingThe driver currently assumes that the notify callback is only receivedwhen the device is done with all the queued buffers.However, this is not true, since the notify callback could be calledwithout any of the queued buffers being completed (for example, withvirtio-pci and shared interrupts) or with only some of the buffers beingcompleted (since the driver makes them available to the device inmultiple separate virtqueue_add_sgs() calls).This can lead to incorrect data on the I2C bus or memory corruption inthe guest if the device operates on buffers which are have been freed bythe driver.  (The WARN_ON in the driver is also triggered.)
