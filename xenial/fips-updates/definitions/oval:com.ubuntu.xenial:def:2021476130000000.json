		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c:virtio: fix completion handling The driver currently assumes that thenotify callback is only received when the device is done with all thequeued buffers. However, this is not true, since the notify callback couldbe called without any of the queued buffers being completed (for example,with virtio-pci and shared interrupts) or with only some of the buffersbeing completed (since the driver makes them available to the device inmultiple separate virtqueue_add_sgs() calls). This can lead to incorrectdata on the I2C bus or memory corruption in the guest if the deviceoperates on buffers which are have been freed by the driver. (The WARN_ONin the driver is also triggered.)
