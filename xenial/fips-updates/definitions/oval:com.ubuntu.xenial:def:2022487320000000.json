		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: fix off by one in BIOS boundary checkingBounds checking when parsing init scripts embedded in the BIOS rejectaccess to the last byte. This causes driver initialization to fail onApple eMac's with GeForce 2 MX GPUs, leaving the system with no workingconsole.This is probably only seen on OpenFirmware machines like PowerPC Macsbecause the BIOS image provided by OF is only the used parts of the ROM,not a power-of-two blocks read from PCI directly so PCs always haveempty bytes at the end that are never accessed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48732` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
