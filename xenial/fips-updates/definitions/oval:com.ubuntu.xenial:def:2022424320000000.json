		"Description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive informationon affected installations of the Linux Kernel 6.0-rc2. An attacker mustfirst obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the targetsystem in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw existswithin the nft_osf_eval function. The issue results from the lack of properinitialization of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leveragethis in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code inthe context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-18540.",
