When CONFIG_TYPEC_DP_ALTMODE is not enabled,ucsi_register_displayport returns NULL which causes a NULL pointerdereference in trace. Rather than return NULL, calltypec_port_register_altmode to register DisplayPort alternate modeas a non-controllable mode when CONFIG_TYPEC_DP_ALTMODE is not enabled.",
