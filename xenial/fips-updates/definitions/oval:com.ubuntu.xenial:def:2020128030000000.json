		"description": "ODF documents can contain forms to be filled out by the user. Similar toHTML forms, the contained form data can be submitted to a URI, for example,to an external web server. To create submittable forms, ODF implements theXForms W3C standard, which allows data to be submitted without the need formacros or other active scripting Prior to version 6.4.4 LibreOffice allowedforms to be submitted to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling formsubmissions to overwrite local files. User-interaction is required tosubmit the form, but to avoid the possibility of malicious documentsengineered to maximize the possibility of inadvertent user submission thisfeature has now been limited to http[s] URIs, removing the possibility tooverwrite local files.
