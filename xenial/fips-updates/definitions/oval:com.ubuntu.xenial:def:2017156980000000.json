		"Description": "When parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate, Apache TomcatNative Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctlyhandle fields longer than 127 bytes. The result of the parsing error was toskip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible for client certificates thatshould have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted.Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.",
