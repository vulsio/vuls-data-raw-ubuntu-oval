		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sysctl: always initialize i_uid/i_gidAlways initialize i_uid/i_gid inside the sysfs core so set_ownership()can safely skip setting them.Commit 5ec27ec735ba (\"fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c: fix the default values ofi_uid/i_gid on /proc/sys inodes.\") added defaults for i_uid/i_gid whenset_ownership() was not implemented. It also missed adjustingnet_ctl_set_ownership() to use the same default values in case thecomputation of a better value failed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42312` to fix the vulnerability.
