		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: qgroup: fix quota root leak after quota disable failureIf during the quota disable we fail when cleaning the quota tree or whendeleting the root from the root tree, we jump to the 'out' label withoutever dropping the reference on the quota root, resulting in a leak of theroot since fs_info->quota_root is no longer pointing to the root (we haveset it to NULL just before those steps).Fix this by always doing a btrfs_put_root() call under the 'out' label.This is a problem that exists since qgroups were first added in 2012 bycommit bed92eae26cc (\"Btrfs: qgroup implementation and prototypes\"), butback then we missed a kfree on the quota root and free_extent_buffer()calls on its root and commit root nodes, since back then roots were notyet reference counted.",
