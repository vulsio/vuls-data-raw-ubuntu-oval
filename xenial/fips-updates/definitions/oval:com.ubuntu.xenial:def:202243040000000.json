		"Title": "CVE-2022-4304 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryptionimplementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across anetwork in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successfuldecryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number oftrial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA paddingmodes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection,RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret tothe server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between aclient and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to theserver and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficientlylarge number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secretused for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.",
