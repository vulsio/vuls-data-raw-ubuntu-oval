    "Title": "CVE-2023-0210 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A bug affects the Linux kernelâ€™s ksmbd NTLMv2 authentication and is known to crash the OS immediately in Linux-based systems. It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
