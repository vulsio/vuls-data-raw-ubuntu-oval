		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc() Fix a bug where nilfs_get_block()returns a successful status when searching and inserting the specifiedblock both fail inconsistently. If this inconsistent behavior is not due toa previously fixed bug, then an unexpected race is occurring, so return atemporary error -EAGAIN instead. This prevents callers such as__block_write_begin_int() from requesting a read into a buffer that is notmapped, which would cause the BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag insubmit_bh_wbc() to fail.",
