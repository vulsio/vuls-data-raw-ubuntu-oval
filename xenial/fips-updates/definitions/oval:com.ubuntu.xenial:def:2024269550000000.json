Ifthis inconsistent behavior is not due to a previously fixed bug, then anunexpected race is occurring, so return a temporary error -EAGAIN instead.This prevents callers such as __block_write_begin_int() from requesting aread into a buffer that is not mapped, which would cause the BUG_ON checkfor the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc() to fail.",
