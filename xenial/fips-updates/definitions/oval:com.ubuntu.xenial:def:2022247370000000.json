HTTPie has the practical concept ofsessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state thatbelongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk forfurther usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didnâ€˜t distinguish between cookies andhosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookieswhen there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third partywebsite. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.",
