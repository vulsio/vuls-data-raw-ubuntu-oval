		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Disable coherent dumb buffers without 3dCoherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to them usingaccelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers staysin the guest making all of the extra work they're doing to synchronizebetween guest and host useless.Configurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphicsmemory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical loginmanager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use.Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used onconfigs with 3d enabled.",
