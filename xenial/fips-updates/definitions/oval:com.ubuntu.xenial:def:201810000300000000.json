		"description": "Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as aHeap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerableand it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable howeverthis has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threadsare handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially arace condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 iscreating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to thebuffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data isbeing processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using aHeap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free,Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRThas stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact thatthe attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such asfunction as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by anattacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issuedeserves a CVE.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1000030` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nidle-python2.7 - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\nlibpython2.7 - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\nlibpython2.7-minimal - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\nlibpython2.7-stdlib - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\nlibpython2.7-testsuite - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\npython2.7 - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\npython2.7-examples - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\npython2.7-minimal - 2.7.12-1ubuntu0~16.04.4\nNo subscription required",
