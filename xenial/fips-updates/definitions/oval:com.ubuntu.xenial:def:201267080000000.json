    "Title": "CVE-2012-6708 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2012-6708` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjs-jquery - 1.11.3+dfsg-4\nNo subscription required",
