		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: spi-zynq-qspi: Fix a NULL pointer dereference inzynq_qspi_exec_mem_op()In zynq_qspi_exec_mem_op(), kzalloc() is directly used in memset(),which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure ofkzalloc().Fix this bug by adding a check of tmpbuf.This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employsdifferential checking to identify inconsistent security operations(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that theinconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function orthe callers, so they constitute bugs.Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a falsepositive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewedthe bug.Builds with CONFIG_SPI_ZYNQ_QSPI=m show no new warnings,and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4441` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
