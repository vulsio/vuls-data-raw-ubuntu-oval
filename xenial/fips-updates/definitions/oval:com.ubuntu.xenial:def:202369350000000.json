		"description": "wolfSSL SP Math All RSA implementation is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack,new variation of a timing Bleichenbacher style attack, when built with thefollowing options to configure: --enable-all CFLAGS=\"-DWOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA\"The define “WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA” enables static RSA cipher suites, which isnot recommended, and has been disabled by default since wolfSSL 3.6.6.Therefore the default build since 3.6.6, even with \"--enable-all\", is notvulnerable to the Marvin Attack. The vulnerability is specific to staticRSA cipher suites, and expected to be padding-independent. Thevulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts and forgesignatures after probing with a large number of test observations. Howeverthe server’s private key is not exposed.",
