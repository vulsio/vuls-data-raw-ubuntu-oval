The problem was in unfreed usb_coherent.In mcba_usb_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocated and there isnothing, that frees them:1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER   is not set (see mcba_usb_start) and this flag cannot be used with   coherent buffers.Fail log:| [ 1354.053291][ T8413] mcba_usb 1-1:0.0 can0: device disconnected| [ 1367.059384][ T8420] kmemleak: 20 new suspected memory leaks (see/sys/kernel/debug/kmem)So, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent()explicitlyNOTE:The same pattern for allocating and freeing coherent buffersis used in drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_core.c",
