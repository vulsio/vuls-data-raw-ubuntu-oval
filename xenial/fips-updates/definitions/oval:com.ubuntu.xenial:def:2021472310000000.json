The problem was inunfreed usb_coherent. In mcba_usb_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocatedand there is nothing, that frees them: 1) In callback function the urb isresubmitted and that's all 2) In disconnect function urbs are simplykilled, but URB_FREE_BUFFER is not set (see mcba_usb_start) and this flagcannot be used with coherent buffers. Fail log: | [ 1354.053291][ T8413]mcba_usb 1-1:0.0 can0: device disconnected | [ 1367.059384][ T8420]kmemleak: 20 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmem) So,all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent() explicitlyNOTE: The same pattern for allocating and freeing coherent buffers is usedin drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_core.c\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47231` to fix the vulnerability.
