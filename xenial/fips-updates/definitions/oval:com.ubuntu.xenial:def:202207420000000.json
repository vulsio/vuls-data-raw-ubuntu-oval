		"Title": "CVE-2022-0742 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "Memory leak in icmp6 implementation in Linux Kernel 5.13+ allows a remote attacker to DoS a host by making it go out-of-memory via icmp6 packets of type 130 or 131. We recommend upgrading past commit 2d3916f3189172d5c69d33065c3c21119fe539fc. It was discovered that the ICMPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0742` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1079-fips - 4.4.0-1079.86\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
