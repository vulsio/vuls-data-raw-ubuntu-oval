		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_taskCurrently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upperlayer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() ormpi_sata_completion().In this case, the following are the two steps in handling those I/Ocompletions: - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of   the I/O. - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in   pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.When complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such,we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in thepm8001_ccb_task_free() call.Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48792` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
