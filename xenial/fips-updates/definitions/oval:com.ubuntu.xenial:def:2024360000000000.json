		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/hugetlb: fix missing hugetlb_lock for resv uncharge There is a recentreport on UFFDIO_COPY over hugetlb:https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ee06de0616177560@google.com/ 350:lockdep_assert_held(&hugetlb_lock); Should be an issue in hugetlb buttriggered in an userfault context, where it goes into the unlikely pathwhere two threads modifying the resv map together. Mike has a fix in thatpath for resv uncharge but it looks like the locking criteria wasoverlooked: hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd() will update the cgrouppointer, so it requires to be called with the lock held.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36000` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
