		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vduse: check that offset is within bounds in get_config()This condition checks \"len\" but it does not check \"offset\" and thatcould result in an out of bounds read if \"offset > dev->config_size\".The problem is that since both variables are unsigned the\"dev->config_size - offset\" subtraction would result in a very highunsigned value.I think these checks might not be necessary because \"len\" and \"offset\"are supposed to already have been validated using thevhost_vdpa_config_validate() function.  But I do not know the codeperfectly, and I like to be safe.",
