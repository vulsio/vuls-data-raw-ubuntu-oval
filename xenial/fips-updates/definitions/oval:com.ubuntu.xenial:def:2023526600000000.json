		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:rkisp1: Fix IRQ handling due to shared interrupts The driver requests theinterrupts as IRQF_SHARED, so the interrupt handlers can be called at anytime. If such a call happens while the ISP is powered down, the SoC willhang as the driver tries to access the ISP registers. This can bereproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line: EnableCONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ and unload the driver, and the board will hang. Fix thisby adding a new field, 'irqs_enabled', which is used to bail out from theinterrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.",
