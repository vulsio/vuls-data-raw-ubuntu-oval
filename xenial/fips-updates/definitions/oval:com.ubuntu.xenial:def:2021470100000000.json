		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algotcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it writes to&net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also sets ca->flags |=TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced. This has the unintendedside-effect of changing the global net.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_controlsysctl, despite the fact that it is read-only: 97684f0970f6 (\"net: Maketcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns\") Resolve thisnetns \"leak\" by only allowing the init netns to set the default algorithmto one that is restricted. This restriction could be removed iftcp_allowed_congestion_control were namespace-ified in the future. This bugwas uncovered withhttps://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-netns-sysctl-verify",
