		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: buffer: Fix file related error handling in IIO_BUFFER_GET_FD_IOCTLIf we fail to copy the just created file descriptor to userland, wetry to clean up by putting back 'fd' and freeing 'ib'. The code usesput_unused_fd() for the former which is wrong, as the file descriptorwas already published by fd_install() which gets called internally byanon_inode_getfd().This makes the error handling code leaving a half cleaned up filedescriptor table around and a partially destructed 'file' object,allowing userland to play use-after-free tricks on us, by abusingthe still usable fd and making the code operate on a dangling'file->private_data' pointer.Instead of leaving the kernel in a partially corrupted state, don'tattempt to explicitly clean up and leave this to the process exitpath that'll release any still valid fds, including the one createdby the previous call to anon_inode_getfd(). Simply return -EFAULT toindicate the error.",
