		"description": "Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versionsservlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`)that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or`HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when theclient sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but nofilename and very large content. This happens even with the defaultsettings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole partcontent to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request andcause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may beable to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service --although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable toupgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be setto a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited(although still read into memory).",
