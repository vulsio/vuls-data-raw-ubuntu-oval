		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set withtimeoutWhile the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race allows it tocollect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while it is beingreleased from the commit path.Mingi Cho originally reported this issue in a different path in 6.1.xwith a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since7395dfacfff6 (\"netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for setelement timeout\").Fix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gcin this case.According to 08e4c8c5919f (\"netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead ontransaction abort\"), Florian plans to accelerate abort path by releasingobjects via workqueue, therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abortpath too.",
