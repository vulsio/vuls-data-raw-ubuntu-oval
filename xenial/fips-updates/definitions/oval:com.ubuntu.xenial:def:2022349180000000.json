		"Title": "CVE-2022-34918 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. Arthur Mongodin discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data validation. A local attacker could use this to escalate privileges in certain situations.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-34918` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
