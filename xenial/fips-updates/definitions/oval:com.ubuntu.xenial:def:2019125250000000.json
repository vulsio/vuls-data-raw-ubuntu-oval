		"Title": "CVE-2019-12525 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 3.3.9 through 3.5.28 and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the header Proxy-Authorization. It searches for certain tokens such as domain, uri, and qop. Squid checks if this token's value starts with a quote and ends with one. If so, it performs a memcpy of its length minus 2. Squid never checks whether the value is just a single quote (which would satisfy its requirements), leading to a memcpy of its length minus 1.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-12525` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid-cgi - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid-common - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid-purge - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquid3 - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nsquidclient - 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.8\nNo subscription required",
