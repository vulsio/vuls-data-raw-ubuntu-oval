		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/kbuf: hold io_buffer_list reference over mmap If we look up thekbuf, ensure that it doesn't get unregistered until after we're done withit. Since we're inside mmap, we cannot safely use the io_uring lock. Relyon the fact that we can lookup the buffer list under RCU now and grab areference to it, preventing it from being unregistered until we're donewith it. The lookup returns the io_buffer_list directly with it referenced.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35880` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
