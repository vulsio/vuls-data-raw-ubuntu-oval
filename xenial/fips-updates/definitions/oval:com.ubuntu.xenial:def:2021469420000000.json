However the function uses per-taskcounters to track the number of inflight requests, so it counts morerequests than available via currect io_uring ctx and goes to sleep forthem to appear (e.g. from IRQ), that will never happen.Cancel a bit more than before, i.e. all ctxs that share sqpolland continue to use shared counters. Don't forget that we should notremove ctx from the list before running that task_work sqpoll-cancel,otherwise the function wouldn't be able to find the context and willhang.",
