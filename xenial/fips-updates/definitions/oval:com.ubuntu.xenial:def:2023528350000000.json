The allocated page for this array is physicallycontiguous (and virtually contiguous) with an order of 0..MAX_ORDER. If thesize of pointer array crosses the limitation set by MAX_ORDER, it reveals aWARNING. So bail out early with -ENOMEM if the request AUX area is out ofbound, e.g.: #perf record -C 0 -m ,4G -e arm_spe_0// -- sleep 1 failed tommap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)",
