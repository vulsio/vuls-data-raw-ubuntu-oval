		"Title": "CVE-2021-3753 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access to vc_mode is not protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. It was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
