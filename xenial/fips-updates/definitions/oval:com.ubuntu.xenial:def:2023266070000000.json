    "Title": "CVE-2023-26607 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_attr_find in fs/ntfs/attrib.c. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
