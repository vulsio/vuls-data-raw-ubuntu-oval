		"description": "A res_pjsip_session crash was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.xbefore 13.37.1, 16.x before 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x before18.0.1. and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert5. Upon receiving a new SIPInvite, Asterisk did not return the created dialog locked or referenced.This caused a gap between the creation of the dialog object, and its nextuse by the thread that created it. Depending on some off-nominalcircumstances and timing, it was possible for another thread to free saiddialog in this gap. Asterisk could then crash when the dialog object, orany of its dependent objects, were dereferenced or accessed next by theinitial-creation thread. Note, however, that this crash can only occur whenusing a connection-oriented protocol (e.g., TCP or TLS, but not UDP) forSIP transport. Also, the remote client must be authenticated, or Asteriskmust be configured for anonymous calling.",
