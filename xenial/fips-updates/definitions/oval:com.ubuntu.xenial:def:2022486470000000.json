In that case, the offset is 0 becausethe tx queues are in the single existing channel at index 0, together withthe rx queue. Without this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, ittries to get the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting theseerrors: WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/tx.c:540efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc] [...] RIP:0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc] [...] Call Trace: <IRQ>dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230 sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360__dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40 [...] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULLpointer dereference at 0000000000000020 [...] RIP:0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc] [...] Call Trace: <IRQ>dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230 sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360__dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40 [...]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48647` to fix the vulnerability.
