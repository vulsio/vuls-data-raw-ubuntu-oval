		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/tdx: Zero out the missing RSI in TDX_HYPERCALL macro In theTDX_HYPERCALL asm, after the TDCALL instruction returns from the untrustedVMM, the registers that the TDX guest shares to the VMM need to be clearedto avoid speculative execution of VMM-provided values. RSI is specified inthe bitmap of those registers, but it is missing when zeroing out thoseregisters in the current TDX_HYPERCALL. It was there when it was originallyadded in commit 752d13305c78 (\"x86/tdx: Expand __tdx_hypercall() to handlemore arguments\"), but was later removed in commit 1e70c680375a (\"x86/tdx:Do not corrupt frame-pointer in __tdx_hypercall()\"), which was correctbecause %rsi is later restored in the \"pop %rsi\". However a later commit7a3a401874be (\"x86/tdx: Drop flags from __tdx_hypercall()\") removed that\"pop %rsi\" but forgot to add the \"xor %rsi, %rsi\" back. Fix by adding itback.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52874` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1098.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
