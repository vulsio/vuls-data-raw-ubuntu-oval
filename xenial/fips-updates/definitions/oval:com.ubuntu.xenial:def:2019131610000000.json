		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source through 13.27.0, 14.x and15.x through 15.7.2, and 16.x through 16.4.0, and Certified Asteriskthrough 13.21-cert3. A pointer dereference in chan_sip while handling SDPnegotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling an SDPanswer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability anattacker must cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request tothem. Upon receipt, the attacker must send an SDP answer containing both aT.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing only a codec (whichis not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration).",
