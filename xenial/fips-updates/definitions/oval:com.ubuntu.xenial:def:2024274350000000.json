		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvme: fix reconnection fail due to reserved tag allocationWe found a issue on production environment while using NVMe over RDMA,admin_q reconnect failed forever while remote target and network is ok.After dig into it, we found it may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tagallocation. In my case, the tag was hold by a keep alive requestwaiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while reset ctrl, so therequest maked as idle and will not process before reset success. Asfabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, weneed a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was heldby keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q. As a result, wefailed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, Ithink we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.",
