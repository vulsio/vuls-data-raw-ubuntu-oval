		"description": "An issue was discovered in Rsyslog v8.1908.0.contrib/pmcisconames/pmcisconames.c has a heap overflow in the parser forCisco log messages. The parser tries to locate a log message delimiter (inthis case, a space or a colon), but fails to account for strings that donot satisfy this constraint. If the string does not match, then thevariable lenMsg will reach the value zero and will skip the sanity checkthat detects invalid log messages. The message will then be consideredvalid, and the parser will eat up the nonexistent colon delimiter. In doingso, it will decrement lenMsg, a signed integer, whose value was zero andnow becomes minus one. The following step in the parser is to shift leftthe contents of the message. To do this, it will call memmove with theright pointers to the target and destination strings, but the lenMsg willnow be interpreted as a huge value, causing a heap overflow.",
