		"description": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability inApache Solr.The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variablesavailable to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specify whichenvironment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed towork for known secret Java system properties. Environment variables cannotbe strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may beset for the entire host,Â unlike Java system properties which are setper-Java-proccess.The Solr Metrics API is protected by the \"metrics-read\" permission.Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be vulnerable viausers with the \"metrics-read\" permission.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or later, in whichenvironment variables are not published via the Metrics API.",
