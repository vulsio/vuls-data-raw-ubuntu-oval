		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst null pointer dereference This patch fixes atunnel_dst null pointer dereference due to lockless access in the tunnelegress path. When deleting a vlan tunnel the tunnel_dst pointer is set toNULL without waiting a grace period (i.e. while it's still usable) andpackets egressing are dereferencing it without checking. UseREAD/WRITE_ONCE to annotate the lockless use of tunnel_id, use RCU foraccessing tunnel_dst and make sure it is read only once and checked in theegress path. The dst is already properly RCU protected so we don't need todo anything fancy than to make sure tunnel_id and tunnel_dst are read onlyonce and checked in the egress path.",
