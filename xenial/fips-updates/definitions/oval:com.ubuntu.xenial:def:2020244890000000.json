		"Description": "Incomplete cleanup in some Intel(R) VT-d products may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. It was discovered that some Intel processors may not properly invalidate cache entries used by Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d). This may allow a local user to perform a privilege escalation attack.",
