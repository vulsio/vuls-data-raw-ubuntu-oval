		"description": "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Startingversion 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if thedestination file is under destination directory. However, it is notenforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is not slashterminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with aname thats begins with the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`.Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, thearbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case.Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for this vulnerability.",
