		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: phy:mdio: fix memory leak Syzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface,the problem was in wrong state logic. MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states:1. Bus is only allocated 2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails,but device_register() was called In case of device_register() has beencalled we should call put_device() to correctly free the memory allocatedfor this device, but mdiobus_free() calls just kfree(dev) in case ofMDIOBUS_ALLOCATED state To avoid this behaviour we need to set bus->stateto MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED _before_ calling device_register(), becauseput_device() should be called even in case of device_register() failure.",
