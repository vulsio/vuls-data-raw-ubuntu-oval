		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay This mostlyreverts commit 6bd97bf273bd (\"ext4: remove redundantmb_regenerate_buddy()\") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based oncode in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as freeblocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of the buddybitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26601` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1003-fips - 4.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
