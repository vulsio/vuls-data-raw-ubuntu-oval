    "Title": "CVE-2022-2959 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Compliant (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's watch queue due to a missing lock in pipe_resize_ring(). The specific flaw exists within the handling of pipe buffers. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. Selim Enes Karaduman discovered that a race condition existed in the pipe buffers implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly escalate privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2959` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.4.0-1082-fips - 4.4.0-1082.89\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
