		"description": "The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 couldoptimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call,thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurredbecause a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within asingle execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() callmay be the same.",
