		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageType The current folio_test_hugetlb()can be fooled by a concurrent folio split into returning true for a foliowhich has never belonged to hugetlbfs. This can't happen if the callerholds a refcount on it, but we have a few places (memory-failure,compaction, procfs) which do not and should not take a speculativereference. Since hugetlb pages do not use individual page mapcounts (theyare always fully mapped and use the entire_mapcount field to record thenumber of mappings), the PageType field is available now thatpage_mapcount() ignores the value in this field. In compaction and withCONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, the current implementation can result in an oops,as reported by Luis. This happens since 9c5ccf2db04b (\"mm: removeHUGETLB_PAGE_DTOR\") effectively added some VM_BUG_ON() checks in thePageHuge() testing path.
