		"description": "Integer overflow in the PointGFp constructor in Botan before 1.10.11 and1.11.x before 1.11.27 allows remote attackers to overwrite memory andpossibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ECC point, which triggers aheap-based buffer overflow.The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of theoutput buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithmin cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolledmultiplication function.The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding, whichaccepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for remote codeexecution.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-2195` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibbotan-1.10-1 - 1.10.12-1\nNo subscription required",
