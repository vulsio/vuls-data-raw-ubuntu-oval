		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: r8169:Fix possible ring buffer corruption on fragmented Tx packets. An issue wasfound on the RTL8125b when transmitting small fragmented packets, wherebyinvalid entries were inserted into the transmit ring buffer, subsequentlyleading to calls to dma_unmap_single() with a null address. This was causedby rtl8169_start_xmit() not noticing changes to nr_frags which may occurwhen small packets are padded (to work around hardware quirks) inrtl8169_tso_csum_v2(). To fix this, postpone inspecting nr_frags untilafter any padding has been applied.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38586` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
