		"description": "An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMPPacket Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IPfragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. Anattacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to triggerthe use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in whichactual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently performany type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that donot implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where notactually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to beemployed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes thatalready implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result ofthe generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A iscommunicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread droppingof IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation)[RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and HostA. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B,reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation ofIPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). WhenHost B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the receivedICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since wepreviously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were beingdropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in aDoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers areemploying IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) todrop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementionedBGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB errormessages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering sessionby simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementionedrouters will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-10142` to fix the vulnerability.
