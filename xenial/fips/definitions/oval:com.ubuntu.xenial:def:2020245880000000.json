		"Title": "CVE-2020-24588 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled certain malformed frames. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious server, a physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject packets.",
