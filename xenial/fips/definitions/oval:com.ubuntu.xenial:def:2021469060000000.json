		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: HID:usbhid: fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrl In hid_submit_ctrl(), the way ofcalculating the report length doesn't take into account that report->sizecan be zero. When running the syzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0causes hid_submit_ctrl) to calculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. Whenthis urb is passed to the usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of16384 bytes. To fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for thezero report size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call itfrom hid_submit_ctrl().",
