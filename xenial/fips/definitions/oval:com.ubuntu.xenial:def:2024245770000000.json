		"description": "libgit2 is a portable C implementation of the Git core methods provided asa linkable library with a solid API, allowing to build Git functionalityinto your application. Using well-crafted inputs to `git_index_add` cancause heap corruption that could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.There is an issue in the `has_dir_name` function in `src/libgit2/index.c`,which frees an entry that should not be freed. The freed entry is laterused and overwritten with potentially bad actor-controlled data leading tocontrolled heap corruption. Depending on the application that uses libgit2,this could lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue has been patched inversion 1.6.5 and 1.7.2.",
