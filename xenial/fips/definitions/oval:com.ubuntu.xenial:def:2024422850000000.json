		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDsiw_conn_req_handler() associates a new struct rdma_id_private (conn_id)withan existing struct iw_cm_id (cm_id) as follows:        conn_id->cm_id.iw = cm_id;        cm_id->context = conn_id;        cm_id->cm_handler = cma_iw_handler;rdma_destroy_id() frees both the cm_id and the struct rdma_id_private. Makesure that cm_work_handler() does not trigger a use-after-free by onlyfreeing of the struct rdma_id_private after all pending work has finished.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42285` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
