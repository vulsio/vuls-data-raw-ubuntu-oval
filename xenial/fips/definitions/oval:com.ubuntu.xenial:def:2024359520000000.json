		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/ast: Fix soft lockup There is a while-loop in ast_dp_set_on_off() thatcould lead to infinite-loop. This is because the register, VGACRI-Dx,checked in this API is a scratch register actually controlled by a MCU,named DPMCU, in BMC. These scratch registers are protected by scu-lock. Ifsuc-lock is not off, DPMCU can not update these registers and then hostwill have soft lockup due to never updated status. DPMCU is used to controlDP and relative registers to handshake with host's VGA driver. Even themost time-consuming task, DP's link training, is less than 100ms. 200msshould be enough.",
