		"description": "A flaw was found in the QEMU virtio-fs shared file system daemon(virtiofsd) implementation. This flaw is strictly related toCVE-2018-13405. A local guest user can create files in the directoriesshared by virtio-fs with unintended group ownership in a scenario where adirectory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not amember of the group. This could allow a malicious unprivileged user insidethe guest to gain access to resources accessible to the root group,potentially escalating their privileges within the guest. A malicious localuser in the host might also leverage this unexpected executable filecreated by the guest to escalate their privileges on the host system.",
