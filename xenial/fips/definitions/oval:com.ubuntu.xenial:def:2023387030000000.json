		"Description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written inC with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is ahigher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level mediatransport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is notsynchronized with its lower level transport that may introduceuse-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that haveSRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying mediatransport other than UDP. This vulnerabilityâ€™s impact may range fromunexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memorycorruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch.",
