		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ethernet:enic: Fix a use after free bug in enic_hard_start_xmit Inenic_hard_start_xmit, it calls enic_queue_wq_skb(). Insideenic_queue_wq_skb, if some error happens, the skb will be freed bydev_kfree_skb(skb). But the freed skb is still used inskb_tx_timestamp(skb). My patch makes enic_queue_wq_skb() return error andgoto spin_unlock() incase of error. The solution is provided by Govind.
