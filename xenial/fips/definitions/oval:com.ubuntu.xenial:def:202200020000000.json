    "Title": "CVE-2022-0002 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by Intel to their processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information.",
