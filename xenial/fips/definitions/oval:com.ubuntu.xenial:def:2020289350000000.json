		"description": "NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.12.0, and NLnet Labs NSD,up to and including version 4.3.3, contain a local vulnerability that wouldallow for a local symlink attack. When writing the PID file, Unbound andNSD create the file if it is not there, or open an existing file forwriting. In case the file was already present, they would follow symlinksif the file happened to be a symlink instead of a regular file. Anadditional chown of the file would then take place after it was written,making the user Unbound/NSD is supposed to run as the new owner of thefile. If an attacker has local access to the user Unbound/NSD runs as, shecould create a symlink in place of the PID file pointing to a file that shewould like to erase. If then Unbound/NSD is killed and the PID file is notcleared, upon restarting with root privileges, Unbound/NSD will rewrite anyfile pointed at by the symlink. This is a local vulnerability that couldcreate a Denial of Service of the system Unbound/NSD is running on. Itrequires an attacker having access to the limited permission userUnbound/NSD runs as and point through the symlink to a critical file on thesystem.",
