		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: padata:Fix refcnt handling in padata_free_shell() In a high-load arm64environment, the pcrypt_aead01 test in LTP can lead to system UAF(Use-After-Free) issues. Due to the lengthy analysis of the pcrypt_aead01function call, I'll describe the problem scenario using a simplified model:Suppose there's a user of padata named `user_function` that adheres to thepadata requirement of calling `padata_free_shell` after `serial()` has beeninvoked, as demonstrated in the following code: ```c struct request {struct padata_priv padata; struct completion *done; }; void parallel(structpadata_priv *padata) { do_something(); } void serial(struct padata_priv*padata) { struct request *request = container_of(padata, struct request,padata); complete(request->done); } void user_function() {DECLARE_COMPLETION(done) padata->parallel = parallel; padata->serial =serial; padata_do_parallel(); wait_for_completion(&done);padata_free_shell(); } ``` In the corresponding padata.c file, there's thefollowing code: ```c static void padata_serial_worker(struct work_struct*serial_work) { ... cnt = 0; while (!list_empty(&local_list)) { ...padata->serial(padata); cnt++; } local_bh_enable(); if(refcount_sub_and_test(cnt, &pd->refcnt)) padata_free_pd(pd); } ``` Becauseof the high system load and the accumulation of unexecuted softirq at thismoment, `local_bh_enable()` in padata takes longer to execute than usual.Subsequently, when accessing `pd->refcnt`, `pd` has already been releasedby `padata_free_shell()`, resulting in a UAF issue with `pd->refcnt`. Thefix is straightforward: add `refcount_dec_and_test` before calling`padata_free_pd` in `padata_free_shell`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52854` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
