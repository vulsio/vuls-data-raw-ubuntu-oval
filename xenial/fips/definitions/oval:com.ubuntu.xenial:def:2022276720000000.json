    "Title": "CVE-2022-27672 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "When SMT is enabled, certain AMD processors may speculatively execute instructions using a target from the sibling thread after an SMT mode switch potentially resulting in information disclosure. It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
