    "Title": "CVE-2023-0459 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Copy_from_user on 64-bit versions of the Linux kernel does not implement the __uaccess_begin_nospec allowing a user to bypass the \"access_ok\" check and pass a kernel pointer to copy_from_user(). This would allow an attacker to leak information. We recommend upgrading beyond commit 74e19ef0ff8061ef55957c3abd71614ef0f42f47 Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
