		"Title": "CVE-2022-42915 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxyfor a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to theremote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and then tunnelsthe rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request(HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific portnumbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code tothe client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could triggera double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URLfor the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, ortelnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0.",
