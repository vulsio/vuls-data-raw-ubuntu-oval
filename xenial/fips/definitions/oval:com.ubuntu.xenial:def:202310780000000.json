		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets)protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of alist causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this withrds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info*info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled bylocal user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of boundsaccess, and a lock corruption.",
