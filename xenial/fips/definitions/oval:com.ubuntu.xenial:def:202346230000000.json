		"Title": "CVE-2023-4623 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f. Budimir Markovic discovered that the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inner classes, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
