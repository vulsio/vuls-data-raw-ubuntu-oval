		"description": "Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Using carefullycrafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSSthrough Sanitize starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 6.0.2when Sanitize is configured to use the built-in \"relaxed\" config or whenusing a custom config that allows `style` elements and one or more CSSat-rules. This could result in cross-site scripting or other undesiredbehavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a browser.Sanitize 6.0.2 performs additional escaping of CSS in `style` elementcontent, which fixes this issue. Users who are unable to upgrade canprevent this issue by using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow `style`elements, using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow CSS at-rules, or bymanually escaping the character sequence `</` as `<\\/` in `style` elementcontent.",
