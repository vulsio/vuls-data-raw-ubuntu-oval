		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tty:n_gsm: fix race condition in status line change on dead connectionsgsm_cleanup_mux() cleans up the gsm by closing all DLCIs, stopping alltimers, removing the virtual tty devices and clearing the data queues. Thisprocedure, however, may cause subsequent changes of the virtual modemstatus lines of a DLCI. More data is being added the outgoing data queueand the deleted kick timer is restarted to handle this. At this point manyresources have already been removed by the cleanup procedure. Thus, akernel panic occurs. Fix this by proving in gsm_modem_update() that thecleanup procedure has not been started and the mux is still alive. Notethat writing to a virtual tty is already protected by checks against theDLCI specific connection state.",
