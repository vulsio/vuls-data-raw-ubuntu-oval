		"Title": "CVE-2022-1195 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in drivers/net/hamradio. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service (DOS) when the mkiss or sixpack device is detached and reclaim resources early. It was discovered that the implementation of the 6pack and mkiss protocols in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
