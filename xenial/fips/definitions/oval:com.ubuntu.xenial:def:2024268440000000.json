		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: block:Fix WARNING in _copy_from_iter Syzkaller reports a warning in_copy_from_iter because an iov_iter is supposedly used in the wrongdirection. The reason is that syzcaller managed to generate a request witha transfer direction of SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV. This instructs the kernel tocopy user buffers into the kernel, read into the copied buffers and thencopy the data back to user space. Thus the iovec is used in bothdirections. Detect this situation in the block layer and construct a newiterator with the correct direction for the copy-in.",
