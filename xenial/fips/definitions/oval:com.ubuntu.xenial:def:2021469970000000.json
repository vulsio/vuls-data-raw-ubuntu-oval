		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entryZenghui reports that booting a kernel with \"irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1\"on the command line hits a warning during kernel entry, due to the waywe manipulate the PMR.Early in the entry sequence, we call lockdep_hardirqs_off() to informlockdep that interrupts have been masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhenentering an exception). Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected byexception entry, and we don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early inthe exception entry sequence, so early in exception entry the PMR canindicate that interrupts are unmasked even though they are masked byDAIF.If DEBUG_LOCKDEP is selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check thatinterrupts are masked, before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of theexception entry paths, and hence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN() thatsomething is amiss.We can avoid this by consistently setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET duringexception entry so that kernel code sees a consistent environment. Wemust also update local_daif_inherit() to undo this, as currently onlytouches DAIF. For other paths, local_daif_restore() will update bothDAIF and the PMR. With this done, we can remove the existing specialcases which set this later in the entry code.We always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency withlocal_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever encounters(GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this itself. Thismatches the gic_prio_kentry_setup that we have to retain forret_to_user.The original splat from Zenghui's report was:| DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(!irqs_disabled())| WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 125 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:4258lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8| Modules linked in:| CPU: 3 PID: 125 Comm: modprobe Tainted: G        W         5.12.0-rc8+#463| Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015| pstate: 604003c5 (nZCv DAIF +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--)| pc : lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8| lr : lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8| sp : ffff80002a39bad0| pmr_save: 000000e0| x29: ffff80002a39bad0 x28: ffff0000de214bc0| x27: ffff0000de1c0400 x26: 000000000049b328| x25: 0000000000406f30 x24: ffff0000de1c00a0| x23: 0000000020400005 x22: ffff8000105f747c| x21: 0000000096000044 x20: 0000000000498ef9| x19: ffff80002a39bc88 x18: ffffffffffffffff| x17: 0000000000000000 x16: ffff800011c61eb0| x15: ffff800011700a88 x14: 0720072007200720| x13: 0720072007200720 x12: 0720072007200720| x11: 0720072007200720 x10: 0720072007200720| x9 : ffff80002a39bad0 x8 : ffff80002a39bad0| x7 : ffff8000119f0800 x6 : c0000000ffff7fff| x5 : ffff8000119f07a8 x4 : 0000000000000001| x3 : 9bcdab23f2432800 x2 : ffff800011730538| x1 : 9bcdab23f2432800 x0 : 0000000000000000| Call trace:|  lockdep_hardirqs_off+0xd4/0xe8|  enter_from_kernel_mode.isra.5+0x7c/0xa8|  el1_abort+0x24/0x100|  el1_sync_handler+0x80/0xd0|  el1_sync+0x6c/0x100|  __arch_clear_user+0xc/0x90|  load_elf_binary+0x9fc/0x1450|  bprm_execve+0x404/0x880|  kernel_execve+0x180/0x188|  call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0xdc/0x158|  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18",
