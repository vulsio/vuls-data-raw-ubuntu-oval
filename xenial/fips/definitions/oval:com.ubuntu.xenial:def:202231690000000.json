    "Title": "CVE-2022-3169 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A denial of service flaw may occur if there is a consecutive request of the NVME_IOCTL_RESET and the NVME_IOCTL_SUBSYS_RESET through the device file of the driver, resulting in a PCIe link disconnect. It was discovered that the NVMe driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reset events in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
