		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer The previouscommit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer->device being dereferenced. It'sactually easier and faster performance-wise to instead get the device fromctx->wg. This semantically makes more sense too, sincectx->wg->peer_allowedips.seq is compared with ctx->allowedips_seq, basingthem both in ctx. This also acts as a defence in depth provision againstfreed peers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26950` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
