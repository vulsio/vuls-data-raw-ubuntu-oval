		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: support deferring bpf_link dealloc to after RCU grace periodBPF link for some program types is passed as a \"context\" which can beused by those BPF programs to look up additional information. E.g., formulti-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.Because of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zerothere could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.This patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback toafter RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two differentdeallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferredone is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred()callback to happen after RCU GP.BPF is using two flavors of RCU: \"classic\" non-sleepable one and RCUtasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs areused. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPFprogram's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only fornon-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP(taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPFprogram is sleepable.We use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereferencelink during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to usedeferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree exposeraw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtimeas well.",
