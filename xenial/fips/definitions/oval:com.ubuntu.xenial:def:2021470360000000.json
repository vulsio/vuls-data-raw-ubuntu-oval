		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:udp: skip L4 aggregation for UDP tunnel packetsIf NETIF_F_GRO_FRAGLIST or NETIF_F_GRO_UDP_FWD are enabled, and thereare UDP tunnels available in the system, udp_gro_receive() could end-updoing L4 aggregation (either SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 or SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST) atthe outer UDP tunnel level for packets effectively carrying and UDPtunnel header.That could cause inner protocol corruption. If e.g. the relevantpackets carry a vxlan header, different vxlan ids will be ignored/aggregated to the same GSO packet. Inner headers will be ignored, too,so that e.g. TCP over vxlan push packets will be held in the GROengine till the next flush, etc.Just skip the SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 and SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST code path if thecurrent packet could land in a UDP tunnel, and let udp_gro_receive()do GRO via udp_sk(sk)->gro_receive.The check implemented in this patch is broader than what is strictlyneeded, as the existing UDP tunnel could be e.g. configured on top ofa different device: we could end-up skipping GRO at-all for some packets.Anyhow, that is a very thin corner case and covering it will add quitea bit of complexity.v1 -> v2: - hopefully clarify the commit message",
