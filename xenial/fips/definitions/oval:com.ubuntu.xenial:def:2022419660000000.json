		"description": "XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with astack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only viamanipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash codeimplementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculationcausing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 whichhandles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationExceptioninstead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSetand whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change thedefault implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code examplein the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your applicationdoes not care about the implementation of the map and all elements arecomparable.",
