		"Description": "Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, andcommand-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables areexposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2.Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objectsin Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in otherconfigurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with aservice being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables tologged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protectthe secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protectionrules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***`being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlistswill hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI,custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumentedURL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameteris also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules andblacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shownas-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hostsand services with the custom variable in question.",
