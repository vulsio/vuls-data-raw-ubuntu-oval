    "Title": "CVE-2022-3628 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Broadcom Full MAC Wi-Fi driver. This issue occurs when a user connects to a malicious USB device. This can allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges. It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
