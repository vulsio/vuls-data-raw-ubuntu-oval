		"Description": "WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with animproper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ viaheap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormapto have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger. Thepatch replaces the hardcoded 256 value with a call to MagickMin() to ensurethe proper value is used. This could impact application availability when aspecially crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This flaw affectsImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.",
