		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: vduse:check that offset is within bounds in get_config() This condition checks\"len\" but it does not check \"offset\" and that could result in an out ofbounds read if \"offset > dev->config_size\". The problem is that since bothvariables are unsigned the \"dev->config_size - offset\" subtraction wouldresult in a very high unsigned value. I think these checks might not benecessary because \"len\" and \"offset\" are supposed to already have beenvalidated using the vhost_vdpa_config_validate() function. But I do notknow the code perfectly, and I like to be safe.",
