		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/rds: fix possible cp null dereferencecp might be null, calling cp->cp_conn would produce null dereference[Simon Horman adds:]Analysis:* cp is a parameter of __rds_rdma_map and is not reassigned.* The following call-sites pass a NULL cp argument to __rds_rdma_map()  - rds_get_mr()  - rds_get_mr_for_dest* Prior to the code above, the following assumes that cp may be NULL  (which is indicative, but could itself be unnecessary)\ttrans_private = rs->rs_transport->get_mr(\t\tsg, nents, rs, &mr->r_key, cp ? cp->cp_conn : NULL,\t\targs->vec.addr, args->vec.bytes,\t\tneed_odp ? ODP_ZEROBASED : ODP_NOT_NEEDED);* The code modified by this patch is guarded by IS_ERR(trans_private),  where trans_private is assigned as per the previous point in thisanalysis.  The only implementation of get_mr that I could locate is rds_ib_get_mr()  which can return an ERR_PTR if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.* ret is set to PTR_ERR(trans_private).  rds_ib_get_mr can return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) if the conn (4th) argument isNULL.  Thus ret may be -ENODEV in which case the code in question will execute.Conclusion:* cp may be NULL at the point where this patch adds a check;  this patch does seem to address a possible bug",
