		"description": "A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c) before5.12-rc8 can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of anetwork service or an unprivileged process. If sctp_destroy_sock is calledwithout sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock then an element is removed from theauto_asconf_splist list without any proper locking. This can be exploitedby an attacker with network service privileges to escalate to root or fromthe context of an unprivileged user directly if aBPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE is attached which denies creation of some SCTPsocket.",
