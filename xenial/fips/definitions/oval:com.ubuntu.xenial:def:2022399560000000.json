The multipart payload will therefore bypass detection. A vulnerablebackend that supports these encoding schemes can potentially be exploited.The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as thecurrently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users areadvised upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively. The mitigation againstthese vulnerabilities depends on the installation of the latest ModSecurityversion (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).",
