		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added Commit09ed8bfc5215 (\"wilc1000: Rename workqueue from \"WILC_wq\" to \"NETDEV-wq\"\")moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to set theinterface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver needs onlyone workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we add aninterface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a newone. This can be observed with the following commands: for i in $(seq 0 10)do iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed iw dev wlan1 del done ps-eo pid,comm|grep wlan 39 kworker/R-wlan0 98 kworker/R-wlan1 102kworker/R-wlan1 105 kworker/R-wlan1 108 kworker/R-wlan1 111 kworker/R-wlan1114 kworker/R-wlan1 117 kworker/R-wlan1 120 kworker/R-wlan1 123kworker/R-wlan1 126 kworker/R-wlan1 129 kworker/R-wlan1 Fix this leakage byputting back hif_workqueue allocation in wilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding theworkqueue name, it is indeed relevant to set it lowercase, however it isnot attached to a specific netdev, so enforcing netdev name in the name isnot so relevant. Still, enrich the name with the wiphy name to make itclear which phy is using the workqueue.",
