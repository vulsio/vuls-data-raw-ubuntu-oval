    "Title": "CVE-2022-42719 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free in the mac80211 stack when parsing a multi-BSSID element in the Linux kernel 5.2 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to crash the kernel and potentially execute code. Sönke Huster discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
