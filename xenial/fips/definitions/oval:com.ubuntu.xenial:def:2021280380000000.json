    "Title": "CVE-2021-28038 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3, as used with Xen PV. A certain part of the netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors). A host OS denial of service may occur during misbehavior of a networking frontend driver. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-26931. Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28038` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-generic - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-lowlatency - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-210-generic - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-210-lowlatency - 4.4.0-207.239\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1126-aws - 4.4.0-1126.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1091-kvm - 4.4.0-1091.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1150-raspi2 - 4.4.0-1150.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-generic - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-lowlatency - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-4.4.0-210-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-210-generic - 4.4.0-207.239\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-210-lowlatency - 4.4.0-207.239\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1154-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1154.164\nNo subscription required",
