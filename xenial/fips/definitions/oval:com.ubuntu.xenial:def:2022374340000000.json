Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).",

		"Note": "mdeslaur> Since 3.1.3-7, rsync builds with the system zlib. Apps are only vulnerable if they use inflateGetHeader() and call inflate() in a loop. This fix caused a regression, see: https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/09/1 https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9271 The second commit below fixes the regression."
