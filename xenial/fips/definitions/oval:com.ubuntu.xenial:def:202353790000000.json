		"description": "A flaw was found in Undertow. When an AJP request is sent that exceeds themax-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in an errorstate by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the TCPconnection without returning an AJP response. This happens becausemod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance as an error worker when theTCP connection is closed from the backend after sending the AJP requestwithout receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This issue couldallow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests that exceed themax-header-size, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).",
