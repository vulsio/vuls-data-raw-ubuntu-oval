		"description": "An integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Givena sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memoryfor a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does notreturn -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds writeaccess.
