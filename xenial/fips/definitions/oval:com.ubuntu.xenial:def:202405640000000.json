		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's memory deduplication mechanism. Themax page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernelversion 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the attacker and thevictim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is \"max pagesharing=256\", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to mergewith the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it mergeswith the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond theKSM's \"max page share\". Through these operations, the attacker can leak thevictim's page.",
