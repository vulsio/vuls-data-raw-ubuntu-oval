    "Title": "CVE-2023-5345 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's fs/smb/client component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. In case of an error in smb3_fs_context_parse_param, ctx->password was freed but the field was not set to NULL which could lead to double free. We recommend upgrading past commit e6e43b8aa7cd3c3af686caf0c2e11819a886d705. It was discovered that the SMB network file sharing protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
