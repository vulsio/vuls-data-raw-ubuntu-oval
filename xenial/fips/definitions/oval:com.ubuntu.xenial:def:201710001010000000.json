		"Title": "CVE-2017-1000101 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low",
		"Description": "curl supports \"globbing\" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numericalrange to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence oftransfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, therewas an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL ifgiven a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is storedin a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read somethingelse instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw wouldbe `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000101` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nNo subscription required",
