		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean upThere are cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believesthe NPIV is logged into the fabric.  This occurs when a vport isunregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to thefabric.Currently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDsincludingthe fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rportobject.  This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID andLOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.Fix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_IDand LOGO are sent.",
