		"Title": "CVE-2023-2194 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device driver. The userspace \"data->block[0]\" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution. It was discovered that the SLIMpro I2C device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate user-supplied data in some situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
