		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing: Restructure trace_clock_global() to never blockIt was reported that a fix to the ring buffer recursion detection wouldcause a hung machine when performing suspend / resume testing. Thefollowing backtrace was extracted from debugging that case:Call Trace: trace_clock_global+0x91/0xa0 __rb_reserve_next+0x237/0x460 ring_buffer_lock_reserve+0x12a/0x3f0 trace_buffer_lock_reserve+0x10/0x50 __trace_graph_return+0x1f/0x80 trace_graph_return+0xb7/0xf0 ? trace_clock_global+0x91/0xa0 ftrace_return_to_handler+0x8b/0xf0 ? pv_hash+0xa0/0xa0 return_to_handler+0x15/0x30 ? ftrace_graph_caller+0xa0/0xa0 ? trace_clock_global+0x91/0xa0 ? __rb_reserve_next+0x237/0x460 ? ring_buffer_lock_reserve+0x12a/0x3f0 ? trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve+0x3c/0x120 ? trace_event_buffer_reserve+0x6b/0xc0 ? trace_event_raw_event_device_pm_callback_start+0x125/0x2d0 ? dpm_run_callback+0x3b/0xc0 ? pm_ops_is_empty+0x50/0x50 ? platform_get_irq_byname_optional+0x90/0x90 ? trace_device_pm_callback_start+0x82/0xd0 ? dpm_run_callback+0x49/0xc0With the following RIP:RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x69/0x200Since the fix to the recursion detection would allow a single recursion tohappen while tracing, this lead to the trace_clock_global() taking a spinlock and then trying to take it again:ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {  trace_clock_global() {    arch_spin_lock() {      queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {        /* lock taken */        (something else gets traced by function graph tracer)          ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {            trace_clock_global() {              arch_spin_lock() {                queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {                /* DEAD LOCK! */Tracing should *never* block, as it can lead to strange lockups like theabove.Restructure the trace_clock_global() code to instead of simply taking alock to update the recorded \"prev_time\" simply use it, as two eventshappening on two different CPUs that calls this at the same time, reallydoesn't matter which one goes first. Use a trylock to grab the lock forupdating the prev_time, and if it fails, simply try again the next time.If it failed to be taken, that means something else is already updatingit.Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212761",
