		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: of:module: add buffer overflow check in of_modalias() In of_modalias(), if thebuffer happens to be too small even for the 1st snprintf() call, the lenparameter will become negative and str parameter (if not NULL initially)will point beyond the buffer's end. Add the buffer overflow check after the1st snprintf() call and fix such check after the strlen() call (accountingfor the terminating NUL char).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38541` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
