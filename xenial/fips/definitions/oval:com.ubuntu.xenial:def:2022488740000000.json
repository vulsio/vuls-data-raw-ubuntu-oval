		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free and race in fastrpc_map_findCurrently, there is a race window between the point when the mutex isunlocked in fastrpc_map_lookup and the reference count increasing(fastrpc_map_get) in fastrpc_map_find, which can also lead touse-after-free.So lets merge fastrpc_map_find into fastrpc_map_lookup which allows usto both protect the maps list by also taking the &fl->lock spinlock andthe reference count, since the spinlock will be released only after.Add take_ref argument to make this suitable for all callers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48874` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
