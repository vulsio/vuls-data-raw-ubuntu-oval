		"description": "Arbitrary File Overwrite in Eclipse JGit <= 6.6.0 In Eclipse JGit, allversions <= 6.6.0.202305301015-r, a symbolic link present in a speciallycrafted git repository can be used to write a file to locations outside theworking tree when this repository is cloned with JGit to a case-insensitivefilesystem, or when a checkout from a clone of such a repository isperformed on a case-insensitive filesystem. This can happen on checkout(DirCacheCheckout), merge (ResolveMerger via its WorkingTreeUpdater), pull(PullCommand using merge), and when applying a patch (PatchApplier). Thiscan be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the filewritten outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on asubsequent git command. The issue occurs only on case-insensitivefilesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The userperforming the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symboliclinks for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in thegit configuration. Setting git configuration option core.symlinks = falsebefore checking out avoids the problem. The issue was fixed in Eclipse JGitversion 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via MavenCentral https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/ andrepo.eclipse.orghttps://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ . A backportis available in 5.13.3 starting from 5.13.3.202401111512-r. The JGitmaintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting thisissue.",
