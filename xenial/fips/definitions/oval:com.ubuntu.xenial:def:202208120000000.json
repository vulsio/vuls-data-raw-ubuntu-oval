		"Title": "CVE-2022-0812 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information. It was discovered that the SUNRPC RDMA protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate the header size of a RPC message payload. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
