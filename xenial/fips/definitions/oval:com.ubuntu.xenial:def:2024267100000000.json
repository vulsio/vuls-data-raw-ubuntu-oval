		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB KASAN is seen toincrease stack usage, to the point that it was reported to lead to stackoverflow on some 32-bit machines (see link). To avoid overflows the stacksize was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07 (\"powerpc/kasan:Force thread size increase with KASAN\"). However with a 32KB stack size tobegin with, the doubling leads to a 64KB stack, which causes build errors:arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range(0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and0x0000000000007fff) Although the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KBstack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seemsto be in the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build. So only increase thestack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26710` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
