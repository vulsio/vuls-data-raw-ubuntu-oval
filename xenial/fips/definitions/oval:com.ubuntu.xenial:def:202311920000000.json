		"description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in smb2_is_status_io_timeout() in CIFS inthe Linux Kernel. After CIFS transfers response data to a system call,there are still local variable points to the memory region, and if thesystem call frees it faster than CIFS uses it, CIFS will access a freememory region, leading to a denial of service.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1192` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
