		"Title": "CVE-2022-39188 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs. Jann Horn discovered a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when unmapping VMAs in certain situations, resulting in possible use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
