		"Title": "CVE-2016-5007 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Both Spring Security 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.0 and the Spring Framework 3.2.x,4.0.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and formapping requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictnessof the pattern matching mechanisms, for example with regards to spacetrimming in path segments, can lead Spring Security to not recognizecertain paths as not protected that are in fact mapped to Spring MVCcontrollers that should be protected. The problem is compounded by the factthat the Spring Framework provides richer features with regards to patternmatching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each SpringSecurity and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creatingadditional differences.",
