		"Description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP packet-parsing functionality of the LIVE555 RTSP server library version 0.92. A specially crafted packet can cause a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can send a packet to trigger this vulnerability. It was discovered that liveMedia  incorrectly handled certain network packets. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
