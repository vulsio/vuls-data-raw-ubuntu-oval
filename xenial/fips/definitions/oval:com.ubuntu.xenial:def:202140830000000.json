    "Title": "CVE-2021-4083 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
