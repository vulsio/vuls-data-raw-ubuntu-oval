		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Fix masking negation logic upon negative dst register The negation logicfor the case where the off_reg is sitting in the dst register is notcorrect given then we cannot just invert the add to a sub or vice versa. Asa fix, perform the final bitwise and-op unconditionally into AX from theoff_reg, then move the pointer from the src to dst and finally use AX asthe source for the original pointer arithmetic operation such that theinversion yields a correct result. The single non-AX mov in between ispossible given constant blinding is retaining it as it's not an immediatebased operation.",
