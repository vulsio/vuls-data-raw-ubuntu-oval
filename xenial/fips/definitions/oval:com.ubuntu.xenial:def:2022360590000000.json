		"description": "matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK forJavaScript. In versions prior to 19.4.0 events sent with special strings inkey places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk fromfunctioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability toprocess data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operatingnormally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to theconsumer. This issue has been fixed in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0 and users areadvised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue byredacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data,and restarting the client. Alternatively, redacting the applicable eventsand clearing all storage will often fix most perceived issues. In somecases, no workarounds are possible.",
