		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** Integer overflow vulnerability in tool_operate.c in curl7.65.2 via a large value as the retry delay. NOTE: many parties report thatthis has no direct security impact on the curl user; however, it may (intheory) cause a denial of service to associated systems or networks if, forexample, --retry-delay is misinterpreted as a value much smaller than whatwas intended. This is not especially plausible because the overflow onlyhappens if the user was trying to specify that curl should wait weeks (orlonger) before trying to recover from a transient error.",
