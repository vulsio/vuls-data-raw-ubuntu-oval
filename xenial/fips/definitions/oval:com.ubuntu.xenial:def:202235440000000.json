    "Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Linux Kernel. Affected is the function damon_sysfs_add_target of the file mm/damon/sysfs.c of the component Netfilter. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211044. It was discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
