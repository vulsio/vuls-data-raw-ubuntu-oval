		"Title": "CVE-2023-31085 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/mtd/ubi/cdev.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a divide-by-zero error in do_div(sz,mtd->erasesize), used indirectly by ctrl_cdev_ioctl, when mtd->erasesize is 0. Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
