		"description": "django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based onuser selections. In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automaticallygenerated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to aninteger, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input usingexponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to theform field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter`implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configuredvalidator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable theadditional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator ifthey are not able to upgrade.",
