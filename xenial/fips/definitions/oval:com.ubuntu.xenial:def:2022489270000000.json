		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: adc: tsc2046: fix memory corruption by preventing array overflowOn one side we have indio_dev->num_channels includes all physical channels+timestamp channel. On other side we have an array allocated only forphysical channels. So, fix memory corruption by ARRAY_SIZE() instead ofnum_channels variable.Note the first case is a cleanup rather than a fix as the softwaretimestamp channel bit in active_scanmask is never set by the IIO core.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48927` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
