		"description": "For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (seeXSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode. Since Xen itselfneeds to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests rundirectly the respective shadow page tables. For 64-bit PV guests this meansrunning on the shadow of the guest root page table. In the course ofdealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool associated with adomain, shadows of page tables may be torn down. This tearing down mayinclude the shadow root page table that the CPU in question is presentlyrunning on. While a precaution exists to supposedly prevent the tearingdown of the underlying live page table, the time window covered by thatprecaution isn't large enough.",
