		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i3c:master: mipi-i3c-hci: Fix a kernel panic for accessing DAT_data. The`i3c_master_bus_init` function may attach the I2C devices before the I3Cbus initialization. In this flow, the DAT `alloc_entry`` will be usedbefore the DAT `init`. Additionally, if the `i3c_master_bus_init` fails,the DAT `cleanup` will execute before the device is detached, which willexecue DAT `free_entry` function. The above scenario can cause the driverto use DAT_data when it is NULL.",
