		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:timer: Set lower bound of start tick time Currently ALSA timer doesn't havethe lower limit of the start tick time, and it allows a very small size,e.g. 1 tick with 1ns resolution for hrtimer. Such a situation may lead toan unexpected RCU stall, where the callback repeatedly queuing the expireupdate, as reported by fuzzer. This patch introduces a sanity check of thetimer start tick time, so that the system returns an error when a too smallstart size is set. As of this patch, the lower limit is hard-coded to100us, which is small enough but can still work somehow.",
