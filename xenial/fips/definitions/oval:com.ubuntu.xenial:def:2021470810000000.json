		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:habanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free ingaudi_memset_device_memoryOur code analyzer reported a uaf.In gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create()with 2 refcount.If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into release_cbbranch. One ref of cb is dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could be freedif other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is used by cb->id later,which is a potential uaf.My patch add a variable 'id' to accept the value of cb->id before thehl_cb_put(cb) is called, to avoid the potential uaf.",
