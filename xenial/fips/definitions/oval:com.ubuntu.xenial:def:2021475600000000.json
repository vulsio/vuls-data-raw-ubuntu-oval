		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware When processing port up/downevents generated by the device's firmware, the driver protects itself fromevents reported for non-existent local ports, but not the CPU port (localport 0), which exists, but lacks a netdev. This can result in a NULLpointer dereference when calling netif_carrier_{on,off}(). Fix this bybailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU port. Problemwas only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47560` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
