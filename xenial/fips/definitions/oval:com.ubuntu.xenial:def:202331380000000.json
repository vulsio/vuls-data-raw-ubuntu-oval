		"Title": "CVE-2023-3138 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in libX11. The security flaw occurs because thefunctions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values providedfor the Request, Event, or Error IDs are within the bounds of the arraysthat those functions write to, using those IDs as array indexes. They trustthat they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to thebounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Orgdo. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, anout-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a maliciousproxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Displaystructure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself,possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.",
