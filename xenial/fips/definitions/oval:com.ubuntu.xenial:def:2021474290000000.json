		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/64s: Fix unrecoverable MCE calling async handler from NMI Themachine check handler is not considered NMI on 64s. The early handler isthe true NMI handler, and then it schedules the machine_check_exceptionhandler to run when interrupts are enabled. This works fine except the caseof an unrecoverable MCE, where the true NMI is taken when MSR[RI] is clear,it can not recover, so it calls machine_check_exception directly sosomething might be done about it. Calling an async handler from NMI contextcan result in irq state and other things getting corrupted. This can alsotrigger the BUG at arch/powerpc/include/asm/interrupt.h:168BUG_ON(!arch_irq_disabled_regs(regs) && !(regs->msr & MSR_EE)); Fix this bymaking an _async version of the handler which is called in the normal case,and a NMI version that is called for unrecoverable interrupts.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47429` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
