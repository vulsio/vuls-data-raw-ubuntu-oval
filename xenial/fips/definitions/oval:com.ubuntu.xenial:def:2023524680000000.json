		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: class:fix use-after-free in class_register() The lock_class_key is stillregistered and can be found in lock_keys_hash hlist after subsys_private isfreed in error handler path.A task who iterate over the lock_keys_hashlater may cause use-after-free.So fix that up and unregister thelock_class_key before kfree(cp). On our platform, a driver fails tokset_register because of creating duplicate filename '/class/xxx'.WithKasan enabled, it prints a invalid-access bug report.
