		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm:nv04: Fix out of bounds access When Output Resource (dcb->or) value isassigned in fabricate_dcb_output(), there may be out of bounds access todac_users array in case dcb->or is zero because ffs(dcb->or) is used asindex there. The 'or' argument of fabricate_dcb_output() must beinterpreted as a number of bit to set, not value. Utilize macros from 'enumnouveau_or' in calls instead of hardcoding. Found by Linux VerificationCenter (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
