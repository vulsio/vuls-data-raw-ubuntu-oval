Attackers cantherefore maintain their access to the account even if the password ischanged as long as they have had the chance to login once and get a validremember me cookie. Starting with version 5.3.12, Symfony makes thepassword part of the signature by default. In that way, when the passwordchanges, then the cookie is not valid anymore.",
