		"description": "Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior to3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parsesindex and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an`index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadataa panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the`LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package orthe `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client thisimpacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if amalicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on eachinvocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a maliciousplugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic,the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If usingHelm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use`recover` to catch the panic.",
