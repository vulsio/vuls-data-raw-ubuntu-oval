		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ixgbe:fix unbalanced device enable/disable in suspend/resume pci_disable_device()called in __ixgbe_shutdown() decreases dev->enable_cnt by 1.pci_enable_device_mem() which increases dev->enable_cnt by 1, was removedfrom ixgbe_resume() in commit 6f82b2558735 (\"ixgbe: use generic powermanagement\"). This caused unbalanced increase/decrease. So addpci_enable_device_mem() back.
