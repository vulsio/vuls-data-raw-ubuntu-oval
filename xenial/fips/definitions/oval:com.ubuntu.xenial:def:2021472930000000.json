		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_skbmod: Skip non-Ethernet packets Currently tcf_skbmod_act()assumes that packets use Ethernet as their L2 protocol, which is not alwaysthe case. As an example, for CAN devices: $ ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan$ ip link set up vcan0 $ tc qdisc add dev vcan0 root handle 1: htb $ tcfilter add dev vcan0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 10 \\ matchall action skbmodswap mac Doing the above silently corrupts all the packets. Do not performskbmod actions for non-Ethernet packets.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47293` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
