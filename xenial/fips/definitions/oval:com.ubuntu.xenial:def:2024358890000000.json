		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: idpf:fix kernel panic on unknown packet types In the very rare case where apacket type is unknown to the driver, idpf_rx_process_skb_fields wouldreturn early without calling eth_type_trans to set the skb protocol / thenetwork layer handler. This is especially problematic if tcpdump is runningwhen such a packet is received, i.e. it would cause a kernel panic.Instead, call eth_type_trans for every single packet, even when the packettype is unknown.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35889` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
