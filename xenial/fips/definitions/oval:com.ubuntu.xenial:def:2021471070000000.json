		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSD: Fix READDIR buffer overflowIf a client sends a READDIR count argument that is too small (say,zero), then the buffer size calculation in the new init_dirlisthelper functions results in an underflow, allowing the XDR streamfunctions to write beyond the actual buffer.This calculation has always been suspect. NFSD has never sanity-checked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry encodersmanaged the problem correctly.With the commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing theunderflow to the pointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space().Modern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much data as possiblefor each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests thatexercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @countvalues. Thus this case was missed during testing.",
