		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: mcp251x: fix resume from sleep before interface was brought upSince 8ce8c0abcba3 the driver queues work via priv->restart_work whenresuming after suspend, even when the interface was not previouslyenabled. This causes a null dereference error as the workqueue is onlyallocated and initialized in mcp251x_open().To fix this we move the workqueue init to mcp251x_can_probe() as thereis no reason to do it later and repeat it whenever mcp251x_open() iscalled.[mkl: fix error handling in mcp251x_stop()]",
