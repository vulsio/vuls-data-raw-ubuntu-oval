		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpoints As part ofcommit e81a7018d93a (\"usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structure dynamically\")the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will free the dwc->gadgetstructure upon the device's removal when usb_del_gadget_udc() is called indwc3_gadget_exit(). However, simply freeing the gadget results a danglingpointer situation: the endpoints created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints()have their dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_head anchoredat dwc->gadget->ep_list. Thus when dwc->gadget is freed, the first dwc3_epin the list now has a dangling prev pointer and likewise for the nextpointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list. Thedwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a use-after-freewhen it calls list_del(). This was caught by enabling KASAN and performinga driver unbind. The recent commit 568262bf5492 (\"usb: dwc3: core: Addshutdown callback for dwc3\") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.There are a few possibilities to fix this. One could be to perform alist_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from the rest ofthe dwc3_ep chain. Another approach is what this patch does, by splittingup the usb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate \"del\" and \"put\"components. This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be called beforethe gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46986` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
