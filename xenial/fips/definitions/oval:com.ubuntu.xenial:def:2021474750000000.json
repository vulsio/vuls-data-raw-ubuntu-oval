		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: comedi:vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows The driver uses endpoint-sized USBtransfer buffers but up until recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.Commit e1f13c879a7c (\"staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize ofusb endpoints found\") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences whenaccessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a zerowMaxPacketSize. Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle alsothe other accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 invmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond thebuffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing. The original driverwas for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers. Support was later added fora device that uses bulk transfers and is presumably a full-speed devicewith a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47475` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-167-generic - 4.15.0-167.175~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-167-generic - 4.15.0-167.175~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-167-lowlatency - 4.15.0-167.175~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-aws - 4.15.0-1119.126~16.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-azure - 4.15.0-1130.143~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-gcp - 4.15.0-1115.129~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1086-oracle - 4.15.0-1086.94~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
