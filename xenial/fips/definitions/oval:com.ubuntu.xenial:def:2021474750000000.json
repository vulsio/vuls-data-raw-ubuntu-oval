		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflowsThe driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up untilrecently had no sanity checks on the sizes.Commit e1f13c879a7c (\"staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSizeof usb endpoints found\") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferenceswhen accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has azero wMaxPacketSize.Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the otheraccesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 invmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyondthe buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and ispresumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.",
