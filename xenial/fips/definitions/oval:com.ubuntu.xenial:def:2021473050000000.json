		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma-buf/sync_file: Don't leak fences on merge failure Each add_fence() calldoes a dma_fence_get() on the relevant fence. In the error path, we weren'tcalling dma_fence_put() so all those fences got leaked. Also, in thekrealloc_array failure case, we weren't freeing the fences array. Instead,ensure that i and fences are always zero-initialized and dma_fence_put()all the fences and kfree(fences) on every error path.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47305` to fix the vulnerability.
