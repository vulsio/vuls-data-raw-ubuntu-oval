		"description": "In Symfony before versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5, the CachingHttpClient classfrom the HttpClient Symfony component relies on the HttpCache class tohandle requests. HttpCache uses internal headers like X-Body-Eval andX-Body-File to control the restoration of cached responses. The class wasinitially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTPcalls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used byCachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the response for a requestbeing made by the CachingHttpClient, remote code execution is possible.This has been fixed in versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5.",
