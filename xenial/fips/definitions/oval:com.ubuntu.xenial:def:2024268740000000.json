		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flipIt's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL inmtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip(). pending_needs_vblank value is set bymtk_crtc->event, but in mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded bythe same lock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.Consider the following case: CPU1 CPU2 step 1: mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin()mtk_crtc->event is not null, step 1: mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:mtk_drm_crtc_update_config( !!mtk_crtc->event) step 2: mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->mtk_drm_finish_page_flip: lock mtk_crtc->event set to null,pending_needs_vblank set to false unlock pending_needs_vblank set to true,step 2: mtk_crtc_ddp_irq -> mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,pending_needs_vblank is still true //null pointer Instead of guarding theentire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's more efficient to just check ifmtk_crtc->event is null before use.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26874` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
