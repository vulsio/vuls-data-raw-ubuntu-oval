  "metadata": {
    "Title": "CVE-2019-19039 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - negligible.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** __btrfs_free_extent in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.12 calls btrfs_print_leaf in a certain ENOENT case, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information about register values via the dmesg program. NOTE: The BTRFS development team disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because “1) The kernel provide facilities to restrict access to dmesg - dmesg_restrict=1 sysctl option. So it's really up to the system administrator to judge whether dmesg access shall be disallowed or not. 2) WARN/WARN_ON are widely used macros in the linux kernel. If this CVE is considered valid this would mean there are literally thousands CVE lurking in the kernel - something which clearly is not the case.” It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel in some error conditions could report register information to the dmesg buffer. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19039` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1079-aws - 4.15.0-1079.83~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-gcp - 4.15.0-1080.90~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-112-generic - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-112-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-112-lowlatency - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-112-generic - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-112-lowlatency - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1050-oracle - 4.15.0-1050.54~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1079-aws - 4.15.0-1079.83~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-gcp - 4.15.0-1080.90~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-112-generic - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-112-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-4.15.0-112-lowlatency - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-112-generic - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-112-lowlatency - 4.15.0-112.113~16.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1050-oracle - 4.15.0-1050.54~16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
