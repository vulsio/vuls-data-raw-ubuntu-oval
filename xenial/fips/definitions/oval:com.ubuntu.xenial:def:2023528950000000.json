		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on multishot requestA previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur, but it's onlyapplicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request, we can safelyignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.A blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak abuffer, if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself,it's not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly.It's less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm anythinglike it is for singleshot poll requests.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52895` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
