This assumes that the value of \"new\"is NULL on the first iteration of the inner loop. Make sure that this istrue in all iterations of the outer loop by setting \"new\" to NULL after itsvalue is assigned to \"cur\". Extend the unittest to detect the double freeand add an additional test case that actually triggers this path.",
