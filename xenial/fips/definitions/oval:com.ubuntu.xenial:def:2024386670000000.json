		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: riscv:prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads Top of the kernelthread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. However this is not the casefor the idle threads of the secondary boot harts. Their stacks overlap withtheir pt_regs, so both may get corrupted. Similar issue has been fixed forthe primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28 (\"riscv: prevent stack corruption byreserving task_pt_regs(p) early\"). However that fix was not propagated tothe secondary harts. The problem has been noticed in some CPU hotplug testswith V enabled. The function smp_callin stored several registers on stack,corrupting top of pt_regs structure including status field. As a result,kernel attempted to save or restore inexistent V context.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38667` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
