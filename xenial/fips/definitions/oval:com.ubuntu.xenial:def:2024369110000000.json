Callers need totake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or securityissues.The netvsc driver could free decrypted/shared pages ifset_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the gpadlto decide whether to free the memory.",
