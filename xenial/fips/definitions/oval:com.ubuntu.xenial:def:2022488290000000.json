		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSD: Fix NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE's handling of large file sizesiattr::ia_size is a loff_t, so these NFSv3 procedures must becareful to deal with incoming client size values that are largerthan s64_max without corrupting the value.Silently capping the value results in storing a different valuethan the client passed in which is unexpected behavior, so removethe min_t() check in decode_sattr3().Note that RFC 1813 permits only the WRITE procedure to returnNFS3ERR_FBIG. We believe that NFSv3 reference implementationsalso return NFS3ERR_FBIG when ia_size is too large.",
