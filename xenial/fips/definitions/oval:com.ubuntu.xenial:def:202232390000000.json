		"Description": "A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel video4linux driver was found in the way user triggers em28xx_usb_probe() for the Empia 28xx based TV cards. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the video4linux driver for Empia based TV cards in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
