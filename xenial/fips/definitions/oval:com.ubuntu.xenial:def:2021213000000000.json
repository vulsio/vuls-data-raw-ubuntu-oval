		"Title": "CVE-2021-21300 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Git is an open-source distributed revision control system. In affectedversions of Git a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic linksas well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may causejust-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto acase-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the defaultfile systems on Windows and macOS). Note that clean/smudge filters have tobe configured for that. Git for Windows configures Git LFS by default, andis therefore vulnerable. The problem has been patched in the versionspublished on Tuesday, March 9th, 2021. As a workaound, if symbolic linksupport is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinksfalse`), the described attack won't work. Likewise, if no clean/smudgefilters such as Git LFS are configured globally (i.e. _before_ cloning),the attack is foiled. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositoriesfrom untrusted sources. The earliest impacted version is 2.14.2. The fixversions are: 2.30.1, 2.29.3, 2.28.1, 2.27.1, 2.26.3, 2.25.5, 2.24.4,2.23.4, 2.22.5, 2.21.4, 2.20.5, 2.19.6, 2.18.5, 2.17.62.17.6.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21300` to fix the vulnerability.
