		"title": "CVE-2017-3736 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaringprocedure in OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0g. No ECalgorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSAas a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are notbelieved likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (althoughvery difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce informationabout a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resourcesrequired for such an attack would be very significant and likely onlyaccessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionallyneed online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in ascenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is sharedbetween multiple clients. This only affects processors that support theBMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) andlater or AMD Ryzen.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-3736` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.9\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.9\nNo subscription required",
