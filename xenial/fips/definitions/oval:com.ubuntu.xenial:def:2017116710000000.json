		"Title": "CVE-2017-11671 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low",
		"Description": "Under certain circumstances, the ix86_expand_builtin function in i386.c inGNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5 before 5.5, and6 before 6.4 will generate instruction sequences that clobber the statusflag of the RDRAND and RDSEED intrinsics before it can be read, potentiallycausing failures of these instructions to go unreported. This couldpotentially lead to less randomness in random number generation.",
