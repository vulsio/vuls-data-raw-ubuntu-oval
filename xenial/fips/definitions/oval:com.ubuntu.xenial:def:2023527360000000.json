		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec Several functions that takepart in codec's initialization and removal are re-used by ASoC codecdrivers implementations. Drivers mimic the behavior ofhda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c withtheir component->probe/remove() instead. One of the reasons for that is theexpectation of snd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to aninstance of struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once soundcard components probing commences. As ASoC sound card may be unboundwithout codec device being actually removed from the system, unsetting->preset in snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with moduleunload -> load scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned onlyonce, during device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's modulereloading may occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audiostack.",
