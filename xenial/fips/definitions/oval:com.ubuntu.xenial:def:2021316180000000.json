		"Description": "Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks receivedrequest headers against the size limitations as configured for the serverand used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of theserestrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status codeindicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was notfully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending headerwas the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to aNULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the childprocess. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft andsubmit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affectedmod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTPServer 2.4.47 was never released.",
