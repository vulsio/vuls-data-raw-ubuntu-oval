		"description": "Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the IETFRFC3261 specification. In affected versions Sofia-SIP **lacks both messagelength and attributes length checks** when it handles STUN packets, leadingto controllable heap-over-flow. For example, in stun_parse_attribute(),after we get the attribute's type and length value, the length will be useddirectly to copy from the heap, regardless of the message's left size.Since network users control the overflowed length, and the data is writtento heap chunks later, attackers may achieve remote code execution by heapgrooming or other exploitation methods. The bug was introduced 16 years agoin sofia-sip 1.12.4 (plus some patches through 12/21/2006) to in tree libswith git-svn-id: http://svn.freeswitch.org/svn/freeswitch/trunk@3774d0543943-73ff-0310-b7d9-9358b9ac24b2. Users are advised to upgrade. Thereare no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
