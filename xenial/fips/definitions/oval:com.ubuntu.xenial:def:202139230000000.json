		"Title": "CVE-2021-3923 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA overinfiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernelstack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cmdevice node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive userinformation, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protectionmechanisms.",
