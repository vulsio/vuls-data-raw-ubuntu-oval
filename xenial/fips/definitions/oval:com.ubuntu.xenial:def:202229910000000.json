		"Title": "CVE-2022-2991 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVM subsystem. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. Lucas Leong discovered that the LightNVM subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle data lengths in certain situations. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
