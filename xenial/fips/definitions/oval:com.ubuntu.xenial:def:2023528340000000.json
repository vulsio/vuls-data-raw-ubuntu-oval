		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: atl1c:Work around the DMA RX overflow issue This is based on alx driver commit881d0327db37 (\"net: alx: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue\"). The alxand atl1c drivers had RX overflow error which was why a custom allocatorwas created to avoid certain addresses. The simpler workaround then createdfor alx driver, but not for atl1c due to lack of tester. Instead of using acustom allocator, check the allocated skb address and use skb_reserve() tomove away from problematic 0x...fc0 address. Tested on AR8131 on Acer 4540.",
