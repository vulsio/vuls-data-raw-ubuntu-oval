		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:scsi_debug: Don't call kcalloc() if size arg is zero If the size arg tokcalloc() is zero, it returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR. Because of that, for afollowing NULL pointer check to work on the returned pointer, kcalloc()must not be called with the size arg equal to zero. Return early withouterror before the kcalloc() call if size arg is zero.
