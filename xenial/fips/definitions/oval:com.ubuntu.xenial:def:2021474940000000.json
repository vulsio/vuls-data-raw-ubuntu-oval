		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cfg80211: fix management registrations lockingThe management registrations locking was broken, the list waslocked for each wdev, but cfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update()iterated it without holding all the correct spinlocks, causinglist corruption.Rather than trying to fix it with fine-grained locking, justmove the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still need the list on eachwdev), we already need to hold the wdev lock to change it, sothere's no contention on the lock in any case. This triviallyfixes the bug since we hold one wdev's lock already, and nowwill hold the lock that protects all lists.",
