		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls:fix race between async notify and socket close The submitting thread (onewhich called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto handlercalls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freeddata. Try to avoid the locking and extra flags altogether. Have the mainthread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend solely on the atomicref counter for synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion,either, we are now tightly controlling when completion fires.",
