		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party leaseIt is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first confirmingfl->fl_lmops is the expected manager.  nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict()tests fl_lmops but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owneris an nfs4_delegation anyway.  This is wrong.With this patch we restore the \"!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops\" case to behaveas it did before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as thecurrent code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46690` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
