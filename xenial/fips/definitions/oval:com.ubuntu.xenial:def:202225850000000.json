    "Title": "CVE-2022-2585 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - high.",
    "Description": "It was discovered that when exec'ing from a non-leader thread, armed POSIX CPU timers would be left on a list but freed, leading to a use-after-free. It was discovered that the implementation of POSIX timers in the Linux kernel did not properly clean up timers in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
