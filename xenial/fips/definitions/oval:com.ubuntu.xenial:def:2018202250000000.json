		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because itinstalls the version with the highest version number, even if the user hadintended to obtain a private package from a private index. This onlyaffects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires thatthe package does not already exist in the public index (and thus theattacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE:it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user isresponsible for using --extra-index-url securely.",
