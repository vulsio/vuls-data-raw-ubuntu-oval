		"description": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Theredis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable tointeger overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk networkreplies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredislibrary which does not perform an overflow check before calling thecalloc() heap allocation function. This issue only impacts systems withheap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modernsystems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, bydefault redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator which is also notvulnerable. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and5.0.14.",
