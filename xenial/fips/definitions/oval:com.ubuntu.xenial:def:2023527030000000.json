JiriPirko noted that it's pointless to pass it in the error path, and thatthe value that would be printed in the second error path would be thevalue of act_len from the first call to usb_bulk_msg.[1]With this in mind, let's just not pass act_len to the usb_bulk_msg errorpaths.1: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Y9pY61y1nwTuzMOa@nanopsycho/",
