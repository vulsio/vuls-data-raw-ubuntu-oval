		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlockWhen using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used tocontrol the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When theTTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance duringuserland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interfaceand disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggeredby the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the txstatemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is indeadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TCinterrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes surethe state machine handling is reached, and is properly set toWAIT_AFTER_SEND.",
