		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firewire: ohci: mask bus reset interrupts between ISR and bottom half Inthe FireWire OHCI interrupt handler, if a bus reset interrupt has occurred,mask bus reset interrupts until bus_reset_work has serviced and cleared theinterrupt. Normally, we always leave bus reset interrupts masked. We inferthe bus reset from the self-ID interrupt that happens shortly thereafter. Ascenario where we unmask bus reset interrupts was introduced in 2008 ina007bb857e0b26f5d8b73c2ff90782d9c0972620: If OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS (8)is set in the debug parameter bitmask, we will unmask bus reset interruptsso we can log them. irq_handler logs the bus reset interrupt. However, wecan't clear the bus reset event flag in irq_handler, because we won'tservice the event until later. irq_handler exits with the event flag stillset. If the corresponding interrupt is still unmasked, the first bus resetwill usually freeze the system due to irq_handler being called again eachtime it exits. This freeze can be reproduced by loading firewire_ohci with\"modprobe firewire_ohci debug=-1\" (to enable all debugging output).Apparently there are also some cases where bus_reset_work will get calledsoon enough to clear the event, and operation will continue normally. Thisfreeze was first reported a few months after a007bb85 was committed, butuntil now it was never fixed. The debug level could safely be set to -1through sysfs after the module was loaded, but this would be ineffectual inlogging bus reset interrupts since they were only unmasked duringinitialization. irq_handler will now leave the event flag set but mask busreset interrupts, so irq_handler won't be called again and there will be nofreeze. If OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS is enabled, bus_reset_work willunmask the interrupt after servicing the event, so future interrupts willbe caught as desired. As a side effect to this change,OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS can now be enabled through sysfs in addition toduring initial module loading. However, when enabled through sysfs, loggingof bus reset interrupts will be effective only starting with the second busreset, after bus_reset_work has executed.",
