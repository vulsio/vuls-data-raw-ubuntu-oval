The Swift object store andproxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauthmiddleware authentication mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI.This allows attackers to bypass authentication by inserting a token into anX-Auth-Token header of a new request. NOTE: github.com/openstack/swauthURLs do not mean that Swauth is maintained by an official OpenStack projectteam.",
