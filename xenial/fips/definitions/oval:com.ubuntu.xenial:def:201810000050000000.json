    "Title": "CVE-2018-1000005 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something. leosilva> vulnerability code was introduced after version 7.47 leosilva> trusty and precise/esm are not-affected.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1000005` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.6\nNo subscription required",
