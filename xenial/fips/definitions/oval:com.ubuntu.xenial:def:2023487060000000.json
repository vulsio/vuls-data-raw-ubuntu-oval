		"description": "Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has aheap-use-after-free vulnerability. When executing a `:s` command for thevery first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside thesubstitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causesfree-ing of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial `:s`command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the wholeprocess is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for thevery first :s command. It may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121contains a fix for this issue.",
