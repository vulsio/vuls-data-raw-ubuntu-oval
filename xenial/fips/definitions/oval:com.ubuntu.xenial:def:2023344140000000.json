		"Description": "The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing theactivation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogsfrom attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a malicious pageelicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before navigating toa site with a certificate error and made the renderer extremely busy at thesame time, it could create a gap between when the error page was loaded andwhen the display actually refreshed. With the right timing the elicitedclicks could land in that gap and activate the button that overrides thecertificate error for that site. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <102.12, Firefox < 114, and Thunderbird < 102.12.",
