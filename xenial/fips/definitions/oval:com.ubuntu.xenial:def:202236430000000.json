		"description": "Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It ispossible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in aLinux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appearsto be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stackthat packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section ofthe SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has beenreported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780(bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In casethe frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forwardthose violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core,resulting in said misbehavior.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3643` to fix the vulnerability.
