		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mtd: parsers: qcom: Fix kernel panic on skipped partitionIn the event of a skipped partition (case when the entry name is empty)the kernel panics in the cleanup function as the name entry is NULL.Rework the parser logic by first checking the real partition number andthen allocate the space and set the data for the valid partitions.The logic was also fundamentally wrong as with a skipped partition, theparts number returned was incorrect by not decreasing it for the skippedpartitions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48777` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
