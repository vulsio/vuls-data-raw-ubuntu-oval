		"Title": "CVE-2022-3625 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function devlink_param_set/devlink_param_get of the file net/core/devlink.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211929 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the Netlink device interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability with some network device drivers. A local attacker with admin access to the network device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",

However, we are opting to use 45f05def5c44c806f094709f1c9b03dcecdd54f0 as the introducing commit in case other drivers or the same driver decide to rely on that mitigation and introduce new features with the same kind of vulnerability."
