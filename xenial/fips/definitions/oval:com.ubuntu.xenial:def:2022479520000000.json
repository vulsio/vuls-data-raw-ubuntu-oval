		"description": "lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may allowlocal users to infer whether any file exists, even within a protecteddirectory tree, because \"Failed to open\" often indicates that a file doesnot exist, whereas \"does not refer to a network namespace path\" oftenindicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that \"we willreport back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way ofknowing why it failed\"; however, in many realistic cases, there are noplausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.",
