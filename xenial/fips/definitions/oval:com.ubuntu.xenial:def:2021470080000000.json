		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating Access to the GHCB is mainlyin the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the GHCB will be mapped. But thereare two paths where it is possible the GHCB might not be mapped. Thesev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform thecaller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered.However, if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold, thenthe GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT), which willresult in a NULL pointer dereference. The svm_complete_emulated_msr()routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSRoperation about any errors. While it is likely that the GHCB will be mappedin this situation, add a safe guard in this path to be certain a NULLpointer dereference is not encountered.",
