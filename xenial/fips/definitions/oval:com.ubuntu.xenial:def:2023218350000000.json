    "Title": "CVE-2023-21835 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 11.0.17, 17.0.5, 19.0.1; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8, 21.3.4 and 22.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via DTLS to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). Juraj Somorovsky, Marcel Maehren, Nurullah Erinola, and Robert Merget discovered that the DTLS implementation in the JSSE subsystem of OpenJDK did not properly restrict handshake initiation requests from clients. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
