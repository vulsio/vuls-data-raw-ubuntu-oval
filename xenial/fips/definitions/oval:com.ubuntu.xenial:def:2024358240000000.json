		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: misc:lis3lv02d_i2c: Fix regulators getting en-/dis-abled twice on suspend/resumeWhen not configured for wakeup lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() will calllis3lv02d_poweroff() even if the device has already been turned off by theruntime-suspend handler and if configured for wakeup and the device isruntime-suspended at this point then it is not turned back on to serve as awakeup source. Before commit b1b9f7a49440 (\"misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Addmissing setting of the reg_ctrl callback\"), lis3lv02d_poweroff() failed todisable the regulators which as a side effect made calling poweroff() twiceok. Now that poweroff() correctly disables the regulators, doing this twicetriggers a WARN() in the regulator core: unbalanced disables forregulator-dummy WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 92 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2999_regulator_disable ... Fix lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() to not call poweroff() asecond time if already runtime-suspended and add a poweron() call whennecessary to make wakeup work. lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() has similar issues,with an added weirness that it always powers on the device if it is runtimesuspended, after which the first runtime-resume will call poweron() again,causing the enabled count for the regulator to increase by 1 everysuspend/resume. These unbalanced regulator_enable() calls cause theregulator to never be turned off and trigger the following WARN() on driverunbind: WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1724 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2396_regulator_put Fix this by making lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() mirror the newsuspend().",
