		"Title": "CVE-2019-16255 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows code injection if the first argument (aka the \"command\" argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method. It was discovered that JRuby did not properly sanitize input to Shell#[] and its alias Shell#test. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-16255` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.14\nruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.14\nruby2.3-tcltk - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.14\nNo subscription required",
