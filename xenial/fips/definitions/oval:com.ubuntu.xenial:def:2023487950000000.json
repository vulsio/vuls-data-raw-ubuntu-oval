		"title": "CVE-2023-48795 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found inOpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypassintegrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extensionnegotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up witha connection for which some security features have been downgraded ordisabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary PacketProtocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshakephase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is aneffective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC withEncrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and(if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.
