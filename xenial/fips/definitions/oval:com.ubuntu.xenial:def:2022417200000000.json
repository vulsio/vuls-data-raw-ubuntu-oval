		"Title": "CVE-2022-41720 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "On Windows, restricted files can be accessed via os.DirFS and http.Dir. Theos.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of filesrooted at a given directory. These functions permit access to Windowsdevice files under that root. For example, os.DirFS(\"C:/tmp\").Open(\"COM1\")opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-onlyfilesystem access. In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory(the root of the current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path toescape from the drive and access any path on the system. With fix applied,the behavior of os.DirFS(\"\") has changed. Previously, an empty root wastreated equivalently to \"/\", so os.DirFS(\"\").Open(\"tmp\") would open thepath \"/tmp\". This now returns an error.",
