		"Title": "CVE-2020-25684 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply froma forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if thereply destination address/port is used by the pending forwarded queries.However, it does not use the address/port to retrieve the exact forwardedquery, substantially reducing the number of attempts an attacker on thenetwork would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted bydnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies a query'sattributes that all must be used to match a reply. This flaw allows anattacker to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained withCVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity of a successfulattack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to dataintegrity.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25684` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.75-1ubuntu0.16.04.7\ndnsmasq-base - 2.75-1ubuntu0.16.04.7\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.75-1ubuntu0.16.04.7\nNo subscription required",
