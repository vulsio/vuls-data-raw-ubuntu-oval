		"Title": "CVE-2018-5382 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which canallow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. BouncyCastle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bitHMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47.For situations where people need to create the files for legacy reasons aspecific keystore type \"BKS-V1\" was introduced in 1.49. It should be notedthat the use of \"BKS-V1\" is discouraged by the library authors and shouldonly be used where it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going to cause asecurity issue in itself.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-5382` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibbcmail-java - 1.51-4ubuntu1\nlibbcpg-java - 1.51-4ubuntu1\nlibbcpkix-java - 1.51-4ubuntu1\nlibbcprov-java - 1.51-4ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
