AnImproper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed anattacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating thedocumentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document tocontain both \"X509Data\" and \"KeyValue\" children of the \"KeyInfo\" tag, whichwhen opened caused LibreOffice to verify using the \"KeyValue\" but to reportverification with the unrelated \"X509Data\" value.
