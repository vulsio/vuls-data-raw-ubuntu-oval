    "Title": "CVE-2022-4382 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw caused by a race among the superblock operations in the gadgetfs Linux driver was found. It could be triggered by yanking out a device that is running the gadgetfs side. Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
