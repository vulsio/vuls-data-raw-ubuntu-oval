    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash. Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
