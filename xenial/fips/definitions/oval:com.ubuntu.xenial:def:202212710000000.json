		"description": "An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgreputility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (forexample, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content toan arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficientvalidation when processing filenames with two or more newlines whereselected content and the target file names are embedded in craftedmulti-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attackerto force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.",
