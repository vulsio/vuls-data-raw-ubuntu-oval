		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlwifi: fix double-free bugThe storage for the TLV PC register data wasn't done like allthe other storage in the drv->fw area, which is cleared at theend of deallocation. Therefore, the freeing must also be donedifferently, explicitly NULL'ing it out after the free, sinceotherwise there's a nasty double-free bug here if a file failsto load after this has been parsed, and we get another freelater (e.g. because no other file exists.) Fix that by addingthe missing NULL assignment.",
