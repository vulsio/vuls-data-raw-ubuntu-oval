		"description": "Due to differences in the Erlang-based JSON parser and JavaScript-basedJSON parser, it is possible in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before2.1.1 to submit _users documents with duplicate keys for 'roles' used foraccess control within the database, including the special case '_admin'role, that denotes administrative users. In combination with CVE-2017-12636(Remote Code Execution), this can be used to give non-admin users access toarbitrary shell commands on the server as the database system user. TheJSON parser differences result in behaviour that if two 'roles' keys areavailable in the JSON, the second one will be used for authorising thedocument write, but the first 'roles' key is used for subsequentauthorization for the newly created user. By design, users can not assignthemselves roles. The vulnerability allows non-admin users to givethemselves admin privileges.",
