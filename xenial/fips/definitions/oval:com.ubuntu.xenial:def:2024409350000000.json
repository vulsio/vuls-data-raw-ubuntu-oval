		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cachefiles: flush all requests after setting CACHEFILES_DEADIn ondemand mode, when the daemon is processing an open request, if thekernel flags the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, the cachefiles_daemon_write()will always return -EIO, so the daemon can't pass the copen to the kernel.Then the kernel process that is waiting for the copen triggers a hung_task.Since the DEAD state is irreversible, it can only be exited by closing/dev/cachefiles. Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to markthe cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests toavoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cacheddata before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles.Note that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req,otherwise it may UAF.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40935` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
