		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KEYS:trusted: Do not use WARN when encode fails When asn1_encode_sequence()fails, WARN is not the correct solution. 1. asn1_encode_sequence() is notan internal function (located in lib/asn1_encode.c). 2. Location is known,which makes the stack trace useless. 3. Results a crash if panic_on_warn isset. It is also noteworthy that the use of WARN is undocumented, and itshould be avoided unless there is a carefully considered rationale to useit. Replace WARN with pr_err, and print the return value instead, which isonly useful piece of information.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36975` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
