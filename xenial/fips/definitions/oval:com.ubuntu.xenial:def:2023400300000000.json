		"Title": "CVE-2023-40030 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "Cargo downloads a Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles the project.Starting in Rust 1.60.0 and prior to 1.72, Cargo did not escape Cargofeature names when including them in the report generated by `cargo build--timings`. A malicious package included as a dependency may inject nearlyarbitrary HTML here, potentially leading to cross-site scripting if thereport is subsequently uploaded somewhere. The vulnerability affects usersrelying on dependencies from git, local paths, or alternative registries.Users who solely depend on crates.io are unaffected. Rust 1.60.0 introduced`cargo build --timings`, which produces a report of how long the differentsteps of the build process took. It includes lists of Cargo features foreach crate. Prior to Rust 1.72, Cargo feature names were allowed to containalmost any characters (with some exceptions as used by the feature syntax),but it would produce a future incompatibility warning about them since Rust1.49. crates.io is far more stringent about what it considers a validfeature name and has not allowed such feature names. As the feature nameswere included unescaped in the timings report, they could be used to injectJavascript into the page, for example with a feature name like `features =[\"<img src='' onerror=alert(0)\"]`. If this report were subsequentlyuploaded to a domain that uses credentials, the injected Javascript couldaccess resources from the website visitor. This issue was fixed in Rust1.72 by turning the future incompatibility warning into an error. Usersshould still exercise care in which package they download, by onlyincluding trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that evenwith these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary codeexecution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: amalicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of thesevulnerabilities. crates.io has server-side checks preventing this attack,and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities.crates.io users still need to excercise care in choosing their dependenciesthough, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.",
