		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/prime: Fix use after free in mmap with drm_gem_ttm_mmapdrm_gem_ttm_mmap() drops a reference to the gem object on success. If thegem object's refcount == 1 on entry to drm_gem_prime_mmap(), that drop willfree the gem object, and the subsequent drm_gem_object_get() will be a UAF.Fix by grabbing a reference before calling the mmap helper. This issue wasforseen when the reference dropping was adding in commit 9786b65bc61ac(\"drm/ttm: fix mmap refcounting\"): \"For that to work properly thedrm_gem_object_get() call in drm_gem_ttm_mmap() must be moved so it happensbefore calling obj->funcs->mmap(), otherwise the gem refcount would go downto zero.\"\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47200` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
