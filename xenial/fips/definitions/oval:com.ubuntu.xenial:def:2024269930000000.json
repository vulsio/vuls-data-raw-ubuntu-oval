		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs:sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection() Thesysfs_break_active_protection() routine has an obvious reference leak inits error path. If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails then kn will beNULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection() routine won't getcalled (and would only cause an access violation by trying to dereferencekn->parent if it was called). As a result, the reference to kobj acquiredat the start of the function will never be released. Fix the leak by addingan explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL.",
