		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instanceNothing prevents simultaneous ioctl calls to privcmd_irqfd_assign() andprivcmd_irqfd_deassign(). If that happens, it is possible that a kirqfdcreated and added to the irqfds_list by privcmd_irqfd_assign() may getremoved by another thread executing privcmd_irqfd_deassign(), while theformer is still using it after dropping the locks.This can lead to a situation where an already freed kirqfd instance maybe accessed and cause kernel oops.Use SRCU locking to prevent the same, as is done for the KVMimplementation for irqfds.",
