		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/edid: In connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks readIn commit e11f5bd8228f (\"drm: Add support for DP 1.4 Compliance edidcorruption test\") the function connector_bad_edid() started assumingthat the memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold`edid[0x7e] + 1` blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). Itcompletely ignored the fact that the function was passed `num_blocks`which indicated how much memory had been allocated for the EDID.Let's fix this by adding a bounds check.This is important for handling the case where there's an error in thefirst block of the EDID. In that case we will callconnector_bad_edid() without having re-allocated memory based on`edid[0x7e]`.",
