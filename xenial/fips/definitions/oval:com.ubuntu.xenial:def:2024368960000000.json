		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:core: Fix access violation during port device removal Testing with KASANand syzkaller revealed a bug in port.c:disable_store():usb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL if the hub that the port belongs tois concurrently removed, but the function does not check for thispossibility before dereferencing the returned value. It turns out that thefirst dereference is unnecessary, since hub->intfdev is the parent of theport device, so it can be changed easily. Adding a check for hub == NULLprevents further problems. The same bug exists in the disable_show()routine, and it can be fixed the same way.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36896` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
