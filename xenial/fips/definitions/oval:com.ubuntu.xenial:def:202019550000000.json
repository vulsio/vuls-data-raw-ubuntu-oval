		"description": "CouchDB version 3.0.0 shipped with a new configuration setting that governsaccess control to the entire database server called`require_valid_user_except_for_up`. It was meant as an extension to thelong standing setting `require_valid_user`, which in turn requires that anyand all requests to CouchDB will have to be made with valid credentials,effectively forbidding any anonymous requests. The new`require_valid_user_except_for_up` is an off-by-default setting that wasmeant to allow requiring valid credentials for all endpoints except for the`/_up` endpoint. However, the implementation of this made an error thatlead to not enforcing credentials on any endpoint, when enabled. CouchDBversions 3.0.1[1] and 3.1.0[2] fix this issue.",
