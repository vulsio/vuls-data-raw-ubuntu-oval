		"Title": "CVE-2018-0734 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "The OpenSSL DSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1a (Affected 1.1.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0j (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2q (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2p).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-0734` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.14\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.14\nNo subscription required",
