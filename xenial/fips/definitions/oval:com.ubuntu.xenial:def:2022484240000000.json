    "Title": "CVE-2022-48424 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.1.3, fs/ntfs3/inode.c does not validate the attribute name offset. An unhandled page fault may occur. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
