		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the bufferA memory overlapping copy occurs when deleting a long line. This memoryoverlapping copy can cause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is optimizedto memcpy because memcpy does not ensure its behavior if the destinationbuffer overlaps with the source buffer. The line buffer is not alwaysbroken, because the memcpy utilizes the hardware acceleration, whoseresult is not deterministic.Fix this problem by using replacing the scr_memcpyw with scr_memmovew.",
