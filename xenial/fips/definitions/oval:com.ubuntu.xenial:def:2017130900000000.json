		"description": "The retr.c:fd_read_body() function is called when processing OK responses.When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2, the chunk parseruses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunklength is a non-negative number. The code then tries to read the chunk inpieces of 8192 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing thenegative chunk length to retr.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an intargument, the high 32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leavingfd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length argument. Theattacker can corrupt malloc metadata after the allocated buffer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-13090` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nwget - 1.17.1-1ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
