		"Title": "CVE-2022-2588 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "It was discovered that the cls_route filter implementation in the Linux kernel would not remove an old filter from the hashtable before freeing it if its handle had the value 0. Zhenpeng Lin discovered that the network packet scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly remove all references to a route filter before freeing it in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
