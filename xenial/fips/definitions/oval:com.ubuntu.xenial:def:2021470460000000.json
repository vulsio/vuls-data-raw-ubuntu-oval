		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction()The hdcp_i2c_offsets[] array did not have an entry forHDCP_MESSAGE_ID_WRITE_CONTENT_STREAM_TYPE so it led to an off by oneread overflow.  I added an entry and copied the 0x0 value for the offsetfrom similar code in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c.I also declared several of these arrays as having HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_MAXentries.  This doesn't change the code, but it's just a belt andsuspenders approach to try future proof the code.",
