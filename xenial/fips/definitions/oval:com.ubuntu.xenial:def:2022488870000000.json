		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Remove rcu locks from user resourcesUser resource lookups used rcu to avoid two extra atomics. Unfortunatelythe rcu paths were buggy and it was easy to make the driver crash bysubmitting command buffers from two different threads. Because thelookups never show up in performance profiles replace them with aregular spin lock which fixes the races in accesses to those sharedresources.Fixes kernel oops'es in IGT's vmwgfx execution_buffer stress test andseen crashes with apps using shared resources.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48887` to fix the vulnerability.
