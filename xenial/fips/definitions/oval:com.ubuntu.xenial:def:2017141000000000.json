    "Title": "CVE-2017-14100 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized command execution is possible. The app_minivm module has an \"externnotify\" program configuration option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the caller-id name and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number can come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an arbitrary shell command injection.",
