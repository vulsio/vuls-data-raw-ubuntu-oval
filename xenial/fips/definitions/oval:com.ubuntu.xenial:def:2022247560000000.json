		"description": "Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of datafor operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0,20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM authentication, afailed PAM authentication will leak a small amount of memory. An attackerthat is able to use the PAM Console (i.e. by knowing the shared secret orvia the WebUI) can flood the Director with failing login attempts whichwill eventually lead to an out-of-memory condition in which the Directorwill not work anymore. Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12contain a Bugfix for this problem. Users who are unable to upgrade maydisable PAM authentication as a workaround.",
