The bugoccurs when txs->cnt, data from a URB provided by a USB device, is biggerthan the size of the array txs->txstatus, which is HTC_MAX_TX_STATUS.WARN_ON() already checks it, but there is no bug handling code after thecheck. Make the function return if that is the case. Found by a modifiedversion of syzkaller.
