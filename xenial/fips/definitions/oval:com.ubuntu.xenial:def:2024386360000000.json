I tookalook in the commit, but it looks fine to me. So I thought the cause is notin the commit diff.I found the WARN is printed when the f2fs is set up with multiple devices,and read requests are mapped to the very first block of the second devicein thedirect read path. In this case, f2fs_map_blocks() andf2fs_map_blocks_cached()modify map->m_pblk as the physical block address from each block device. Itbecomes zero when it is mapped to the first block of the device. However,f2fs_iomap_begin() assumes that map->m_pblk is the physical block addressof thewhole f2fs, across the all block devices. It compares map->m_pblk againstNULL_ADDR == 0, then go into the unexpected branch and sets the invalidiomap->length. The WARN catches the invalid iomap->length.This WARN is printed even for non-zoned block devices, by following steps. - Create two (non-zoned) null_blk devices memory backed with 128MB sizeeach:   nullb0 and nullb1. # mkfs.f2fs /dev/nullb0 -c /dev/nullb1 # mount -t f2fs /dev/nullb0 \"${mount_dir}\" # dd if=/dev/zero of=\"${mount_dir}/test.dat\" bs=1M count=192 # dd if=\"${mount_dir}/test.dat\" of=/dev/null bs=1M count=192 iflag=direct...\"So, the root cause of this issue is: when multi-devices feature is on,f2fs_map_blocks() may return zero blkaddr in non-primary device, which isa verified valid block address, however, f2fs_iomap_begin() treats it asan invalid block address, and then it triggers the warning in iomapframework code.Finally, as discussed, we decide to use a more simple and direct way thatchecking (map.m_flags & F2FS_MAP_MAPPED) condition instead of(map.m_pblk != NULL_ADDR) to fix this issue.Thanks a lot for the effort of Yi Zhang and Shinichiro Kawasaki on thisissue.[1]https://lore.kernel.org/linux-f2fs-devel/CAHj4cs-kfojYC9i0G73PRkYzcxCTex=-vugRFeP40g_URGvnfQ@mail.gmail.com/[2]https://lore.kernel.org/linux-f2fs-devel/gngdj77k4picagsfdtiaa7gpgnup6fsgwzsltx6milmhegmjff@iax2n4wvrqye/",
