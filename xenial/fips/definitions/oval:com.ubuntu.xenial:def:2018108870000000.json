		"Title": "CVE-2018-10887 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in libgit2 before version 0.27.3. It has been discovered that an unexpected sign extension in git_delta_apply function in delta.c file may lead to an integer overflow which in turn leads to an out of bound read, allowing to read before the base object. An attacker may use this flaw to leak memory addresses or cause a Denial of Service. It was discovered that libgit2 mishandled specially crafted input. If a victim were tricked into cloning a malicious repository or applying a malicious patch, an attacker could cause libgit2 to leak sensitive information or crash.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10887` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibgit2-24 - 0.24.1-2ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
