		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tipc:skb_linearize the head skb when reassembling msgs It's not a good idea toappend the frag skb to a skb's frag_list if the frag_list already has skbsfrom elsewhere, such as this skb was created by pskb_copy() where thefrag_list was cloned (all the skbs in it were skb_get'ed) and shared bymultiple skbs. However, the new appended frag skb should have been onlyseen by the current skb. Otherwise, it will cause use after free crashes asthis appended frag skb are seen by multiple skbs but it only got skb_getcalled once. The same thing happens with a skb updated by pskb_may_pull()with a skb_cloned skb. Li Shuang has reported quite a few crashes caused bythis when doing testing over macvlan devices: [] kernel BUG atnet/core/skbuff.c:1970!

This patch is to fix it by linearizing thehead skb if it has frag_list set in tipc_buf_append(). Note that we chooseto do this before calling skb_unshare(), as __skb_linearize() will avoidskb_copy(). Also, we can not just drop the frag_list either as the earlytime.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47162` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
