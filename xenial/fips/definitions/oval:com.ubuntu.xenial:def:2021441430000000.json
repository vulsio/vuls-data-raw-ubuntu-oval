Due to an unchecked condition, a malicious or compromised IMAP server could use a crafted mail message that lacks headers (i.e., one that starts with an empty line) to provoke a heap overflow, which could conceivably be exploited for remote code execution.",

I suspect \"unfixed\" is the more correct upper range."
