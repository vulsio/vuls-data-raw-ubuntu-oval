		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/hugetlb: fix missing hugetlb_lock for resv uncharge There is a recentreport on UFFDIO_COPY over hugetlb:https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ee06de0616177560@google.com/ 350:lockdep_assert_held(&hugetlb_lock); Should be an issue in hugetlb buttriggered in an userfault context, where it goes into the unlikely pathwhere two threads modifying the resv map together. Mike has a fix in thatpath for resv uncharge but it looks like the locking criteria wasoverlooked: hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd() will update the cgrouppointer, so it requires to be called with the lock held.",
