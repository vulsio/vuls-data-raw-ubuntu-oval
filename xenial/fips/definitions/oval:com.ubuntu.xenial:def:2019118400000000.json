		"description": "An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, akagolang-googlecode-go-crypto, before 2019-03-20. A flaw was found in theamd64 implementation of golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20 andgolang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa. If more than 256 GiB of keystream isgenerated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, theamd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycleback to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can leadto loss of confidentiality in encryption applications, or to predictabilityin CSPRNG applications.",
