		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst null pointer dereferenceThis patch fixes a tunnel_dst null pointer dereference due to locklessaccess in the tunnel egress path. When deleting a vlan tunnel thetunnel_dst pointer is set to NULL without waiting a grace period (i.e.while it's still usable) and packets egressing are dereferencing itwithout checking. Use READ/WRITE_ONCE to annotate the lockless use oftunnel_id, use RCU for accessing tunnel_dst and make sure it is readonly once and checked in the egress path. The dst is already properly RCUprotected so we don't need to do anything fancy than to make suretunnel_id and tunnel_dst are read only once and checked in the egress path.",
