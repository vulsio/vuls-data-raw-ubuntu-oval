		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:openrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threadsOpenRISC exception handling sends signals to user processes on floatingpoint exceptions and trap instructions (for debugging) among others.There is a bug where the trap handling logic may send signals to kernelthreads, we should not send these signals to kernel threads, if thathappens we treat it as an error.This patch adds conditions to die if the kernel receives theseexceptions in kernel mode code.",
