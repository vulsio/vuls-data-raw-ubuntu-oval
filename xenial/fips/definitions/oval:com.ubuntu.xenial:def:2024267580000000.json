		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: md:Don't ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery() mddev_suspend() neverstop sync_thread, hence it doesn't make sense to ignore suspended array inmd_check_recovery(), which might cause sync_thread can't be unregistered.After commit f52f5c71f3d4 (\"md: fix stopping sync thread\"), following hangcan be triggered by test shell/integrity-caching.sh: 1) suspend the array:raid_postsuspend mddev_suspend 2) stop the array: raid_dtr md_stop__md_stop_writes stop_sync_thread set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_INTR,&mddev->recovery); md_wakeup_thread_directly(mddev->sync_thread);wait_event(..., !test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery)) 3) syncthread done: md_do_sync set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_DONE, &mddev->recovery);md_wakeup_thread(mddev->thread); 4) daemon thread can't unregister syncthread: md_check_recovery if (mddev->suspended) return; -> return directlymd_read_sync_thread clear_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery); ->MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING can't be cleared, hence step 2 hang; This problem isnot just related to dm-raid, fix it by ignoring suspended array inmd_check_recovery(). And follow up patches will improve dm-raid better tofrozen sync thread during suspend.",
