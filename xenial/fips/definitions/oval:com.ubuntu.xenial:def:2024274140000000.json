		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: fix error logic of IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS writing back In the commitd73ef2d69c0d (\"rtnetlink: let rtnl_bridge_setlink checks IFLA_BRIDGE_MODElength\"), an adjustment was made to the old loop logic in the function`rtnl_bridge_setlink` to enable the loop to also check the length of theIFLA_BRIDGE_MODE attribute. However, this adjustment removed the `break`statement and led to an error logic of the flags writing back at the end ofthis function. if (have_flags) memcpy(nla_data(attr), &flags,sizeof(flags)); // attr should point to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS NLA !!! Beforethe mentioned commit, the `attr` is granted to be IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS.However, this is not necessarily true fow now as the updated loop will letthe attr point to the last NLA, even an invalid NLA which could causeoverflow writes. This patch introduces a new variable `br_flag` to save theNLA pointer that points to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS and uses it to resolve thementioned error logic.",
