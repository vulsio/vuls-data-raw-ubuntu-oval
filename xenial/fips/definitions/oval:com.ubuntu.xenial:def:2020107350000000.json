In algorithms with quadratic time complexityusing non-binary bases, when using int(\"text\"), a system could take 50ms toparse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float,decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to systemavailability.",
