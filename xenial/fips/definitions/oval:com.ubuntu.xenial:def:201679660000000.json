    "Title": "CVE-2016-7966 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was possible to inject HTML code in KMail's plaintext viewer. Due to the parser used on the URL it was not possible to include the equal sign (=) or a space into the injected HTML, which greatly reduces the available HTML functionality. Although it is possible to include an HTML comment indicator to hide content.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-7966` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibkf5coreaddons-data - 5.18.0-0ubuntu1.1\nlibkf5coreaddons5 - 5.18.0-0ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
