    "Title": "CVE-2022-2959 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's watch queue due to a missing lock in pipe_resize_ring(). The specific flaw exists within the handling of pipe buffers. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. Selim Enes Karaduman discovered that a race condition existed in the pipe buffers implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly escalate privileges.",
