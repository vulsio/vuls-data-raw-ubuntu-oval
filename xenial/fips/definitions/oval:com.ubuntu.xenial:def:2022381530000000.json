		"description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when--enable-session-ticket is used); however, only version 5.3.0 isexploitable. Man-in-the-middle attackers or a malicious server can crashTLS 1.2 clients during a handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket(more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session cachefrees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the client tocrash with a \"free(): invalid pointer\" message. NOTE: It is likely thatthis is also exploitable during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and amalicious server. With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to exploit this as aman-in-the-middle.",
