		"Title": "CVE-2016-2853 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "The aufs module for the Linux kernel 3.x and 4.x does not properly restrict the mount namespace, which allows local users to gain privileges by mounting an aufs filesystem on top of a FUSE filesystem, and then executing a crafted setuid program. It was discovered that the aufs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict mount namespaces, when mounted with the non-default allow_userns option set. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges.",
