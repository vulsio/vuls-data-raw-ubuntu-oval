		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users tocause a host OS crash because of incorrect error handling in event-channelport allocation. The allocation of an event-channel port may fail formultiple reasons: (1) port is already in use, (2) the memory allocationfailed, or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than what is supportedby the ABI (e.g., 2L or FIFO) used by the guest or the limit set by anadministrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due to the missing errorchecks, only (1) will be considered an error. All the other cases willprovide a valid port and will result in a crash when trying to access theevent channel. When the administrator configured a guest to allow more than1023 event channels, that guest may be able to crash the host. When Xen isout-of-memory, allocation of new event channels will result in crashing thehost rather than reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later areaffected. All architectures are affected. The default configuration, whenguests are created with xl/libxl, is not vulnerable, because of the defaultevent-channel limit.",
