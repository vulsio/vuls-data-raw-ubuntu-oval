		"Title": "CVE-2022-1015 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - high.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue. David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate passed user register indices. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
