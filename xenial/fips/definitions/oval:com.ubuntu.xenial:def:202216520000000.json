    "Title": "CVE-2022-1652 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "Linux Kernel could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a concurrency use-after-free flaw in the bad_flp_intr function. By executing a specially-crafted program, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the system. Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
