		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drainPreviously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to readany data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is correct whendealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the transfercomplete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be transferred havebeen stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO still needs to bepicked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure and DMA engine end upracing to read from RX FIFO, corrupting any data read. Additionally the RXbuffer pointer is never adjusted according to DMA progress in DMA mode,thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA mode is a bug. Fixcorruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode. Alsowait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to ensureall data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.",
