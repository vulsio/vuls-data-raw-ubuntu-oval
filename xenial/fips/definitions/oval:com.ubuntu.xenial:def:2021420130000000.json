		"Description": "It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLsto files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. Iffiles outside of these directories are not protected by the usual defaultconfiguration \"require all denied\", these requests can succeed. If CGIscripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow forremote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache2.4.50 and not earlier versions.",
