However, patches applied to fix the CVE group CVE-2017-137xx and the CVE group CVE-2017-1068x have most likely fixed the currently considered vulnerability as well, with the reproducer no longer causing a segmentation fault for versions of the package that include these patches. This means that within the fixes present in the already applied patches was the fix for this CVE as well."
