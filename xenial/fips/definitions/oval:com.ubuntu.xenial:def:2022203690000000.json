    "Description": "In v4l2_m2m_querybuf of v4l2-mem2mem.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper input validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-223375145References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the Video for Linux 2 (V4L2) implementation in the Linux kernel.
