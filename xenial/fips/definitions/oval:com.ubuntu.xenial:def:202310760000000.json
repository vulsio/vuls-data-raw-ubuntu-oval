		"title": "CVE-2023-1076 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socketUID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initializationfunction. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices requireCAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user onlyhaving that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectlytreated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1076` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-generic - 4.4.0-2.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-211-lowlatency - 4.4.0-2.16\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1094-kvm - 4.4.0-1004.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1129-aws - 4.4.0-1001.10\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
