		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: phy:mdio: fix memory leak Syzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface,the problem was in wrong state logic. MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states:1. Bus is only allocated 2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails,but device_register() was called In case of device_register() has beencalled we should call put_device() to correctly free the memory allocatedfor this device, but mdiobus_free() calls just kfree(dev) in case ofMDIOBUS_ALLOCATED state To avoid this behaviour we need to set bus->stateto MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED _before_ calling device_register(), becauseput_device() should be called even in case of device_register() failure.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47416` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-166-generic - 4.15.0-166.174~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-166-generic - 4.15.0-166.174~16.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-166-lowlatency - 4.15.0-166.174~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1118-aws - 4.15.0-1118.125~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1129-azure - 4.15.0-1129.142~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-gcp - 4.15.0-1114.128~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1085-oracle - 4.15.0-1085.93~16.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
