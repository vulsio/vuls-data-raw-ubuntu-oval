		"description": "There exists a use-after-free in io_uring in the Linux kernel.Signalfd_poll() and binder_poll() use a waitqueue whose lifetime is thecurrent task. It will send a POLLFREE notification to all waiters beforethe queue is freed. Unfortunately, the io_uring poll doesn't handlePOLLFREE. This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or binder fdis polled with io_uring poll, and the waitqueue gets freed. We recommendupgrading past commit fc78b2fc21f10c4c9c4d5d659a685710ffa63659",
