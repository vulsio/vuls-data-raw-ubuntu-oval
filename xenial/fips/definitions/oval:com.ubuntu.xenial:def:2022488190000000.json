		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp: take care of mixed splice()/sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY) casesyzbot found that mixing sendpage() and sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY)calls over the same TCP socket would again trigger theinfamous warning in inet_sock_destruct()\tWARN_ON(sk_forward_alloc_get(sk));While Talal took into account a mix of regular copied dataand MSG_ZEROCOPY one in the same skb, the sendpage() pathhas been forgotten.We want the charging to happen for sendpage(), becausepages could be coming from a pipe. What is missing is thedowngrading of pure zerocopy status to make suresk_forward_alloc will stay synced.Add tcp_downgrade_zcopy_pure() helper so that we canuse it from the two callers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48819` to fix the vulnerability.
