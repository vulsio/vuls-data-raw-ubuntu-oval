		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in cedrus_remove in drivers/staging/media/sunxi/cedrus/cedrus.c. It was discovered that the Allwinner Cedar video engine driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
