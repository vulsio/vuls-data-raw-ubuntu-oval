		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:block: fix request.queuelist usage in flushFriedrich Weber reported a kernel crash problem and bisected to commit81ada09cc25e (\"blk-flush: reuse rq queuelist in flush state machine\").The root cause is that we use \"list_move_tail(&rq->queuelist, pending)\"in the PREFLUSH/POSTFLUSH sequences. But rq->queuelist.next == xxx sinceit's popped out from plug->cached_rq in __blk_mq_alloc_requests_batch().We don't initialize its queuelist just for this first request, althoughthe queuelist of all later popped requests will be initialized.Fix it by changing to use \"list_add_tail(&rq->queuelist, pending)\" sorq->queuelist doesn't need to be initialized. It should be ok since rqcan't be on any list when PREFLUSH or POSTFLUSH, has no move actually.Please note the commit 81ada09cc25e (\"blk-flush: reuse rq queuelist inflush state machine\") also has another requirement that no drivers wouldtouch rq->queuelist after blk_mq_end_request() since we will reuse it toadd rq to the post-flush pending list in POSTFLUSH. If this is not true,we will have to revert that commit IMHO.This updated version adds \"list_del_init(&rq->queuelist)\" in flush rqcallback since the dm layer may submit request of a weird invalid format(REQ_FSEQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FSEQ_POSTFLUSH), which causes double list_addif without this \"list_del_init(&rq->queuelist)\". The weird invalid formatproblem should be fixed in dm layer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40925` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
