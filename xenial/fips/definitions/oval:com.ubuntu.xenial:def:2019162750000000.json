		"description": "hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrectindication of disconnection in certain situations because source addressvalidation is mishandled. This is a denial of service that should have beenprevented by PMF (aka management frame protection). The attacker must senda crafted 802.11 frame from a location that is within the 802.11communications range.An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a speciallyconstructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point tocause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnectionto the network.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-16275` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhostapd - 1:2.4-0ubuntu6.6\nwpagui - 2.4-0ubuntu6.6\nwpasupplicant - 2.4-0ubuntu6.6\nNo subscription required",
