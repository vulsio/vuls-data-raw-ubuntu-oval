		"description": "apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitiveinformation by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The/usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect toapt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicitSocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is passed. Thecron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by default)attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any localuser can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool.There can be sensitive data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth isenabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf. This sensitive data can leakto unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port before theapt-cacher-ng daemon can.",
