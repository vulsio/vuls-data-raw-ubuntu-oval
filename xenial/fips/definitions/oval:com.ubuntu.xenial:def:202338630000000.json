		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in nfc_llcp_find_local in net/nfc/llcp_core.c in NFC in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local user with special privileges to impact a kernel information leak issue. It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication in certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
