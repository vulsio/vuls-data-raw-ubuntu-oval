		"description": "Due to a vulnerability in the io_uring subsystem, it is possible to leakkernel memory information to the user process. timens_install callscurrent_is_single_threaded to determine if the current process issingle-threaded, but this call does not consider io_uring's io_workerthreads, thus it is possible to insert a time namespace's vvar page toprocess's memory space via a page fault. When this time namespace isdestroyed, the vvar page is also freed, but not removed from the process'memory, and a next page allocated by the kernel will be still availablefrom the user-space process and can leak memory contents via this(read-only) use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading pastversion 5.10.161 or commit 788d0824269bef539fe31a785b1517882eafed93https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/io_uring",
