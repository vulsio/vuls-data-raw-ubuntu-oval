		"Description": "PySAML2 before 5.0.0 does not check that the signature in a SAML documentis enveloped and thus signature wrapping is effective, i.e., it is affectedby XML Signature Wrapping (XSW). The signature information and thenode/object that is signed can be in different places and thus thesignature verification will succeed, but the wrong data will be used. Thisspecifically affects the verification of assertion that have been signed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-5390` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-pysaml2 - 3.0.0-3ubuntu1.16.04.4\npython3-pysaml2 - 3.0.0-3ubuntu1.16.04.4\nNo subscription required",
