		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:validate lwtstate->data before returning from skb_tunnel_info()skb_tunnel_info() returns pointer of lwtstate->data as ip_tunnel_info typewithout validation. lwtstate->data can have various types such asmpls_iptunnel_encap, etc and these are not compatible. So skb_tunnel_info()should validate before returning that pointer. Splat looks like: BUG:KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan] Read ofsize 2 at addr ffff888106ec2698 by task ping/811 CPU: 1 PID: 811 Comm: pingNot tainted 5.13.0+ #1195 Call Trace: dump_stack_lvl+0x56/0x7bprint_address_description.constprop.8.cold.13+0x13/0x2ee ?vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan] ? vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan]kasan_report.cold.14+0x83/0xdf ? vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan]vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan] [ ... ] vxlan_xmit_one+0x148b/0x32b0[vxlan] [ ... ] vxlan_xmit+0x25c5/0x4780 [vxlan] [ ... ]dev_hard_start_xmit+0x1ae/0x6e0 __dev_queue_xmit+0x1f39/0x31a0 [ ... ]neigh_xmit+0x2f9/0x940 mpls_xmit+0x911/0x1600 [mpls_iptunnel]lwtunnel_xmit+0x18f/0x450 ip_finish_output2+0x867/0x2040 [ ... ]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47309` to fix the vulnerability.
