		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item Instead ofcalling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item into thedelayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources we haveallocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is finebecause all existing call chains undo anything they have done beforecalling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pendingsnapshots in the transaction commit path). So remove the BUG() call and doproper error handling. This relates to a syzbot report linked below, butdoes not fix it because it only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fixthe issue where somehow we attempt to use twice the same index number fordifferent index items.",
