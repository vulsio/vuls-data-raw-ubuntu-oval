		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vhost/vsock: always initialize seqpacket_allowThere are two issues around seqpacket_allow:1. seqpacket_allow is not initialized when socket is   created. Thus if features are never set, it will be   read uninitialized.2. if VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET is set and then cleared,   then seqpacket_allow will not be cleared appropriately   (existing apps I know about don't usually do this but    it's legal and there's no way to be sure no one relies    on this).To fix:\t- initialize seqpacket_allow after allocation\t- set it unconditionally in set_features\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43873` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
