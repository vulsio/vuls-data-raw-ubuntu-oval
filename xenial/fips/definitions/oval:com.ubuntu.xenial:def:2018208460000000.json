Code is not present in upstream master anymore mdeslaur> Ubuntu packages are built with BUILD_MJ2:BOOL=OFF, so the affected code isn't compiled ccdm94> according to the comments available in issue 1328 of openjpeg (https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues/1328), this issue will not be fixed by upstream, as the vulnerable components were simply removed from the code in pull request #1350. For this reason, xenial and trusty cannot be patched for this issue in package openjpeg. There was a patch available, which was commit c277159986c, however, it did not compile, and therefore was reverted by upstream. No new fixes for this issue were made available, the solution apparently being the removal of the code that contains the vulnerability."
