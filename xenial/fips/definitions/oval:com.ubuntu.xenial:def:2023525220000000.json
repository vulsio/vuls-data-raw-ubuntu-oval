		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix possible store tearing in neigh_periodic_work() While looking at arelated syzbot report involving neigh_periodic_work(), I found that Iforgot to add an annotation when deleting an RCU protected item from alist. Readers use rcu_deference(*np), we need to use eitherrcu_assign_pointer() or WRITE_ONCE() on writer side to prevent storetearing. I use rcu_assign_pointer() to have lockdep support, this was thechoice made in neigh_flush_dev().",
