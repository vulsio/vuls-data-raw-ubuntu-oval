		"Title": "CVE-2021-3669 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Measuring usage of the shared memory does not scale with large shared memory segment counts which could lead to resource exhaustion and DoS. It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
