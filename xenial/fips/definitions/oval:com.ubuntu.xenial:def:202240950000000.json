		"Title": "CVE-2022-4095 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.19.2. This issue occurs in cmd_hdl_filter in drivers/staging/rtl8712/rtl8712_cmd.c, allowing an attacker to launch a local denial of service attack and gain escalation of privileges. Zheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang discovered that the RealTek RTL8712U wireless driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
