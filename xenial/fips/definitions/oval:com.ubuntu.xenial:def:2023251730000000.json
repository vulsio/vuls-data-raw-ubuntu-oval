		"description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found incontainerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary groupsare not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has directaccess to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access,they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary grouprestrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitiveinformation or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may beaffected as well. This bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 andv.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and recreate containers toresolve this issue. Users who rely on a downstream application that usescontainerd's client library should check that application for a separateadvisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that the `\"USER$USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead, set the containerentrypoint to a value similar to `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` to allow`su` to properly set up supplementary groups.",
