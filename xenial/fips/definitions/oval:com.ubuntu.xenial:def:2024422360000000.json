		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: configfs: Prevent OOB read/write in usb_string_copy()Userspace provided string 's' could trivially have the length zero. Leftunchecked this will firstly result in an OOB read in the form`if (str[0 - 1] == '\\n') followed closely by an OOB write in the form`str[0 - 1] = '\\0'`.There is already a validating check to catch strings that are too long.Let's supply an additional check for invalid strings that are too short.",
