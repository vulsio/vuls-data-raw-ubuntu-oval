		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KEYS:trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal The original patch8c657a0590de (\"KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal and unseal operations\")was correct on the mailing list:https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() intpm2_seal_trusted() got lost. This causes an imbalanced put of the TPM opsand causes oopses on TIS based hardware. This fix puts back the losttpm_try_get_ops()",
