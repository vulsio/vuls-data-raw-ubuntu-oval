		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: bcm: rpi: Assign ->num before accessing ->hwsCommit f316cdff8d67 (\"clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with__counted_by\") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the numberof elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out ofbounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must beinitialized with the number of elements before the first array accesshappens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to theinitialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs inraspberrypi_discover_clocks() due to ->num being assigned after ->hwshas been accessed:  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds indrivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c:374:4  index 3 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)'(aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, whichclears up the warning.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39461` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
