		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: vmscan: remove deadlock due to throttling failing to make progressA soft lockup bug in kcompactd was reported in a private bugzilla withthe following visible in dmesg;  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 26s! [kcompactd0:479]  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 52s! [kcompactd0:479]  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 78s! [kcompactd0:479]  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 104s! [kcompactd0:479]The machine had 256G of RAM with no swap and an earlier failedallocation indicated that node 0 where kcompactd was run was potentiallyunreclaimable;  Node 0 active_anon:29355112kB inactive_anon:2913528kB active_file:0kB    inactive_file:0kB unevictable:64kB isolated(anon):0kBisolated(file):0kB    mapped:8kB dirty:0kB writeback:0kB shmem:26780kB shmem_thp:    0kB shmem_pmdmapped: 0kB anon_thp: 23480320kB writeback_tmp:0kB    kernel_stack:2272kB pagetables:24500kB all_unreclaimable? yesVlastimil Babka investigated a crash dump and found that a taskmigrating pages was trying to drain PCP lists;  PID: 52922  TASK: ffff969f820e5000  CPU: 19  COMMAND: \"kworker/u128:3\"  Call Trace:     __schedule     schedule     schedule_timeout     wait_for_completion     __flush_work     __drain_all_pages     __alloc_pages_slowpath.constprop.114     __alloc_pages     alloc_migration_target     migrate_pages     migrate_to_node     do_migrate_pages     cpuset_migrate_mm_workfn     process_one_work     worker_thread     kthread     ret_from_forkThis failure is specific to CONFIG_PREEMPT=n builds.  The root of theproblem is that kcompact0 is not rescheduling on a CPU while a task thathas isolated a large number of the pages from the LRU is waiting onkcompact0 to reschedule so the pages can be released.  Whileshrink_inactive_list() only loops once around too_many_isolated, reclaimcan continue without rescheduling if sc->skipped_deactivate == 1 whichcould happen if there was no file LRU and the inactive anon list was notlow.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48800` to fix the vulnerability.
