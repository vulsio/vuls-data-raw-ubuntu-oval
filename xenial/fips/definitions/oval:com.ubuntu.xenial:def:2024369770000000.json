		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3: Wait unconditionally after issuing EndXfer command Currently allcontroller IP/revisions except DWC3_usb3 >= 310a wait 1ms unconditionallyfor ENDXFER completion when IOC is not set. This is because DWC_usb3controller revisions >= 3.10a supports GUCTL2[14: Rst_actbitlater] bitwhich allows polling CMDACT bit to know whether ENDXFER command iscompleted. Consider a case where an IN request was queued, and parallellysoft_disconnect was called (due to ffs_epfile_release). This eventuallycalls stop_active_transfer with IOC cleared, hence send_gadget_ep_cmd()skips waiting for CMDACT cleared during EndXfer. For DWC3 controllers withrevisions >= 310a, we don't forcefully wait for 1ms either, and we proceedby unmapping the requests. If ENDXFER didn't complete by this time, itleads to SMMU faults since the controller would still be accessing thoserequests. Fix this by ensuring ENDXFER completion by adding 1ms delay in__dwc3_stop_active_transfer() unconditionally.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36977` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
