		"description": "The email module of Python through 3.11.3 incorrectly parses e-mailaddresses that contain a special character. The wrong portion of an RFC2822header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some applications,an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which application accessis granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain(e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). Thisoccurs in email/_parseaddr.py in recent versions of Python.",
