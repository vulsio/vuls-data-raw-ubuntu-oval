		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841 The blamedcommit started to use the ptp workqueue to get the second part of thetimestamp. And when the port was set down, then this workqueue is stopped.But if the config option NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING is not enabled, then theptp_clock is not initialized so then it would crash when it would try toaccess the delayed work. So then basically by setting up and then down theport, it would crash. The fix consists in checking if the ptp_clock isinitialized and only then cancel the delayed work.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38593` to fix the vulnerability.
