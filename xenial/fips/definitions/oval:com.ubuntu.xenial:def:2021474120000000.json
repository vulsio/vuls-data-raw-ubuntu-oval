		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: block:don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked rq_qos frameworkis only applied on request based driver, so: 1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn'tto be called for bio based driver 2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be calledfor bio which isn't tracked, such as bios ended from error handling code.Especially in bio_endio(): 1) request queue is referred viabio->bi_bdev->bd_disk->queue, which may be gone since request queuerefcount may not be held in above two cases 2) q->rq_qos may be freed inblk_cleanup_queue() when calling into __rq_qos_done_bio() Fix the potentialkernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked.This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio() andblkcg_iolatency_done_bio() are nop if the bio isn't tracked.",
