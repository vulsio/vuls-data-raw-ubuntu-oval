		"Title": "CVE-2021-43975 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value. Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the aQuantia AQtion Ethernet device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data coming from the device. A local attacker who can control an emulated device can use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
