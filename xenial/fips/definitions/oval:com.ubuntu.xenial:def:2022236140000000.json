		"description": "Twig is an open source template language for PHP. When in a sandbox mode,the `arrow` parameter of the `sort` filter must be a closure to avoidattackers being able to run arbitrary PHP functions. In affected versionsthis constraint was not properly enforced and could lead to code injectionof arbitrary PHP code. Patched versions now disallow calling non Closure inthe `sort` filter as is the case for some other filters. Users are advisedto upgrade.",
