		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfc:nci: Fix uninit-value in nci_dev_up and nci_ntf_packet syzbot reported thefollowing uninit-value access issue [1][2]: nci_rx_work() parses andprocesses received packet. When the payload length is zero, each messagetype handler reads uninitialized payload and KMSAN detects this issue. Thereceipt of a packet with a zero-size payload is considered unexpected, andtherefore, such packets should be silently discarded. This patch resolvedthis issue by checking payload size before calling each message typehandler codes.",
