When the payload length is zero, each messagetype handler reads uninitialized payload and KMSAN detects this issue. Thereceipt of a packet with a zero-size payload is considered unexpected, andtherefore, such packets should be silently discarded. This patch resolvedthis issue by checking payload size before calling each message typehandler codes.",
