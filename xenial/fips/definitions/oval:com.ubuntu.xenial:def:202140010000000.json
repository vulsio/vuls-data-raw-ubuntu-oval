    "Title": "CVE-2021-4001 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2. It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition around read-only maps. A privileged attacker could use this to modify read-only maps.",
