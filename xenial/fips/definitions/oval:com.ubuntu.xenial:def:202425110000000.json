		"description": "Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can causeunbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions Impact summary: Anattacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger unboundedmemory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service This problem can occurin TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (butnot if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replayprotection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the sessioncache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly asit fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. Amalicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure toforce a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normaloperation. This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It doesnot affect TLS clients. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are notaffected by this issue. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.",
