		"description": "When receiving an OpenPGP/MIME signed email message that contains anadditional outer MIME message layer, for example a message footer added bya mailing list gateway, Thunderbird only considered the inner signedmessage for the signature validity. This gave the false impression that theadditional contents were also covered by the digital signature. Startingwith Thunderbird version 91.4.1, only the signature that belongs to the toplevel MIME part will be considered for the displayed status. Thisvulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.1.",
