		"Title": "CVE-2023-3823 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium",
		"Description": "In PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.30, 8.1.* before 8.1.22, and 8.2.* before8.2.8 various XML functions rely on libxml global state to trackconfiguration variables, like whether external entities are loaded. Thisstate is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly changes it bycalling appropriate function. However, since the state is process-global,other modules - such as ImageMagick - may also use this library within thesame process, and change that global state for their internal purposes, andleave it in a state where external entities loading is enabled. This canlead to the situation where external XML is parsed with external entitiesloaded, which can lead to disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP.This vulnerable state may persist in the same process across many requests,until the process is shut down.",
