		"description": "Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary FileWrite. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside ofthenode_modules folder through the bin field upon installation. A properlyconstructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a packagepublisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user'ssystem when the package is installed. This behavior is still possiblethrough install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the--ignore-scripts install option.",
