    "Title": "CVE-2021-3612 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's joystick devices subsystem in versions before 5.9-rc1, in the way the user calls ioctl JSIOCSBTNMAP. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Murray McAllister discovered that the joystick device interface in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data passed via an ioctl(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on systems with a joystick device registered.",
