		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: typec: ucsi: Move unregister out of atomic sectionCommit '9329933699b3 (\"soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Make client-locknon-sleeping\")' moved the pmic_glink client list under a spinlock, as itis accessed by the rpmsg/glink callback, which in turn is invoked fromIRQ context.This means that ucsi_unregister() is now called from atomic context,which isn't feasible as it's expecting a sleepable context. An effort isunder way to get GLINK to invoke its callbacks in a sleepable context,but until then lets schedule the unregistration.A side effect of this is that ucsi_unregister() can now happenafter the remote processor, and thereby the communication link with it, isgone. pmic_glink_send() is amended with a check to avoid the resulting NULLpointer dereference.This does however result in the user being informed about this error bythe following entry in the kernel log:  ucsi_glink.pmic_glink_ucsi pmic_glink.ucsi.0: failed to send UCSI writerequest: -5\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46691` to fix the vulnerability.
