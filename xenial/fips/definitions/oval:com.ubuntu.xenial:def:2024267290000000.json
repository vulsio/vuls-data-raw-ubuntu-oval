		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srvFixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in thedc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up()functions. In both functions, the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was beingdereferenced before it was checked for null. This could lead to a nullpointer dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it. Thus moving the null checksfor 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the functions to ensure that'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is dereferenced.
