		"Title": "CVE-2019-19449 on Ubuntu 16.04 FIPS Certified (xenial) - low.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image can lead to slab-out-of-bounds read access in f2fs_build_segment_manager in fs/f2fs/segment.c, related to init_min_max_mtime in fs/f2fs/segment.c (because the second argument to get_seg_entry is not validated). It was discovered that the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
