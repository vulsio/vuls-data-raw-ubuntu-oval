		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 HVM guest OSusers to cause a hypervisor crash. An inverted conditional in x86 HVMguests' dirty video RAM tracking code allows such guests to make Xende-reference a pointer guaranteed to point at unmapped space. A maliciousor buggy HVM guest may cause the hypervisor to crash, resulting in Denialof Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Xen versions from 4.8 onwardsare affected. Xen versions 4.7 and earlier are not affected. Only x86systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guestsusing shadow paging can leverage the vulnerability. In addition, thereneeds to be an entity actively monitoring a guest's video frame buffer(typically for display purposes) in order for such a guest to be able toleverage the vulnerability. x86 PV guests, as well as x86 HVM guests usinghardware assisted paging (HAP), cannot leverage the vulnerability.",
