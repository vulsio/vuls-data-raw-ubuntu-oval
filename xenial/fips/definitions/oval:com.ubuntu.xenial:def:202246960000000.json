		"description": "There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel throughio_uring and the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missingthe IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won't usecurrent->nsproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. Thisassumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files willcall the get_uts function which will use current->nsproxy leading toinvalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-freevulnerability. We recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4696` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-hmac-4.4.0-1001-fips - 4.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
