		"description": "Elasticsearch generally filters out sensitive information and credentialsbefore logging to the audit log. It was found that this filtering was notapplied when requests to Elasticsearch use certain deprecated URIs forAPIs. The impact of this flaw is that sensitive information such aspasswords and tokens might be printed in cleartext in Elasticsearch auditlogs. Note that audit logging is disabled by default and needs to beexplicitly enabled and even when audit logging is enabled, request bodiesthat could contain sensitive information are not printed to the audit logunless explicitly configured.",
