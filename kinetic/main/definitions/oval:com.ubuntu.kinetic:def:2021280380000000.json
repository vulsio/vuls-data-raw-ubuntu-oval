		"Title": "CVE-2021-28038 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3, as used with Xen PV. A certain part of the netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors). A host OS denial of service may occur during misbehavior of a networking frontend driver. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-26931. Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28038` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1003-oem - 5.17.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.15.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required",
