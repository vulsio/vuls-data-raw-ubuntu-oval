		"Title": "CVE-2023-1652 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in nfsd4_ssc_setup_dul in fs/nfsd/nfs4proc.c in the NFS filesystem in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or it may lead to a kernel information leak problem. It was discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle pending tasks in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1652` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1023.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1018.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1018.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1023.26\nNo subscription required",
