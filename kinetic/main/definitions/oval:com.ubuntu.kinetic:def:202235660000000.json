    "Title": "CVE-2022-3566 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function tcp_getsockopt/tcp_setsockopt of the component TCP Handler. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211089 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3566` to fix the vulnerability.
