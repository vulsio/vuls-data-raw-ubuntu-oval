		"title": "CVE-2022-40318 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) through 8.4. By crafting a BGP OPEN message with an option of type 0xff (Extended Length from RFC 9072), attackers may cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon restart, or out-of-bounds read). This is possible because of inconsistent boundary checks that do not account for reading 3 bytes (instead of 2) in this 0xff case. NOTE: this behavior occurs in bgp_open_option_parse in the bgp_open.c file, a different location (with a different attack vector) relative to CVE-2022-40302.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-40318` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfrr - 8.1-1ubuntu3.1\nfrr-pythontools - 8.1-1ubuntu3.1\nfrr-rpki-rtrlib - 8.1-1ubuntu3.1\nfrr-snmp - 8.1-1ubuntu3.1\nNo subscription required",
