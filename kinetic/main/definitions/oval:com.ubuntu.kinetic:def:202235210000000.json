		"title": "CVE-2022-3521 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function kcm_tx_work of the file net/kcm/kcmsock.c of the component kcm. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211018 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection Multiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing sockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3521` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1014.21\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1014.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required",
