		"Title": "CVE-2023-26606 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is a use-after-free in ntfs_trim_fs in fs/ntfs3/bitmap.c. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle a loop termination condition, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-26606` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1016.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1016.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required",
