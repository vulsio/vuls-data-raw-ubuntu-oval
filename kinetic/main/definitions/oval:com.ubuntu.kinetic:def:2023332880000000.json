		"title": "CVE-2023-33288 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.2.9. A use-after-free was found in bq24190_remove in drivers/power/supply/bq24190_charger.c. It could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race condition. It was discovered that the BQ24190 charger driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
