    "Title": "CVE-2020-26961 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26961` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 83.0+build2-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nthunderbird - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:78.5.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
