A comment has been made in the issue bug requesting that the issue be closed given that for ijg-libjpeg versions after 9c the vulnerability seems to not be reproducible with the provided PoC file. A discussion on whether this is a libtiff issue or a libjpeg issue can be seen in a few comments in the bug report. The vulnerability also does not reproduce in xenial nor does it reproduce in kinetic."
