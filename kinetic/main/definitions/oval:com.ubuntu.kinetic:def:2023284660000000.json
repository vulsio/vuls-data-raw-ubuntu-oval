    "Title": "CVE-2023-28466 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "do_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6 lacks a lock_sock call, leading to a race condition (with a resultant use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference). It was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
