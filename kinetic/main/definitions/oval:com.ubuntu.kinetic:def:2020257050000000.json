		"title": "CVE-2020-25705 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "A flaw in ICMP packets in the Linux kernel may allow an attacker to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote attacker to effectively bypass source port UDP randomization. Software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well on the Linux Based Products (RUGGEDCOM RM1224: All versions between v5.0 and v6.4, SCALANCE M-800: All versions between v5.0 and v6.4, SCALANCE S615: All versions between v5.0 and v6.4, SCALANCE SC-600: All versions prior to v2.1.3, SCALANCE W1750D: v8.3.0.1, v8.6.0, and v8.7.0, SIMATIC Cloud Connect 7: All versions, SIMATIC MV500 Family: All versions, SIMATIC NET CP 1243-1 (incl. SIPLUS variants): Versions 3.1.39 and later, SIMATIC NET CP 1243-7 LTE EU: Version Keyu Man discovered that the ICMP global rate limiter in the Linux kernel could be used to assist in scanning open UDP ports. A remote attacker could use to facilitate attacks on UDP based services that depend on source port randomization.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25705` to fix the vulnerability.
