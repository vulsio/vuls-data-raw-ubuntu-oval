		"Title": "CVE-2022-33744 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep track of the foreign mappings. Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies of the rbtree. These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform further mappings of other guests' memory pages. Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in the Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33744` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-15.15\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-15.15\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-15.15\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-15.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1001.3\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1001.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-15.15\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-15.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required",
