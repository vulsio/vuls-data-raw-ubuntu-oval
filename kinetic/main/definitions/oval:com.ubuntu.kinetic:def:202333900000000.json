		"title": "CVE-2023-3390 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. Mishandled error handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE makes it possible to use a dangling pointer in the same transaction causing a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue. We recommend upgrading past commit 1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97. It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
