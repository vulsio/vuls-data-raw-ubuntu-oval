		"title": "CVE-2023-31130 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() is vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular \"0::00:00:00/2\" was found to cause an issue. C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration purposes which would require an administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31130` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibc-ares2 - 1.18.1-1ubuntu0.22.10.2\nNo subscription required",
