    "Title": "CVE-2023-32233 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled. Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-32233` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-43.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1026.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1024.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1019.26\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1019.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-43.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1026.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1024.27\nNo subscription required",
