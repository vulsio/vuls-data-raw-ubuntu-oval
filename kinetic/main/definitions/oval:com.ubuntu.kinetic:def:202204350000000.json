		"Title": "CVE-2022-0435 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network. Samuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0435` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.17.0-1003-oem - 5.17.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.15.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required",
