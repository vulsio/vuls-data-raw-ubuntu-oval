		"title": "CVE-2022-41218 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"description": "In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41218` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1016.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1016.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required",
