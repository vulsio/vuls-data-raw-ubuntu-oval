		"description": "A Bleichenbacher type side-channel based padding oracle attack was found in the way gnutls handles verification of RSA decrypted PKCS#1 v1.5 data.

The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngnutls-bin - 3.6.5-2ubuntu1\nguile-gnutls - 3.6.5-2ubuntu1\nlibgnutls-dane0 - 3.6.5-2ubuntu1\nlibgnutls-openssl27 - 3.6.5-2ubuntu1\nlibgnutls30 - 3.6.5-2ubuntu1\nlibgnutlsxx30 - 3.6.5-2ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
