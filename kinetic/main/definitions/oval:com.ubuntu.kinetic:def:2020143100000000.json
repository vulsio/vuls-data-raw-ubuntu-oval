		"title": "CVE-2020-14310 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
		"description": "There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read_section_as_string(). It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker may leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX, leading to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and further heap-based buffer overflow. Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2 when handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-14310` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-common - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-coreboot - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-coreboot-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed-template - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-arm - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-arm-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed-template - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-ia32 - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-ia32-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-riscv64 - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-riscv64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-emu - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-firmware-qemu - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-ieee1275 - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-ieee1275-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-linuxbios - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-pc - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-pc-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-rescue-pc - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-theme-starfield - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-uboot - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-uboot-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-xen - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-xen-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-xen-host - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub2 - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub2-common - 2.06-2ubuntu12\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.185\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.185\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.06-2ubuntu12\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu12\nNo subscription required",
