		"Title": "CVE-2022-27672 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "When SMT is enabled, certain AMD processors may speculatively execute instructions using a target from the sibling thread after an SMT mode switch potentially resulting in information disclosure. It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-27672` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1023.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1018.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1018.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1023.26\nNo subscription required",
