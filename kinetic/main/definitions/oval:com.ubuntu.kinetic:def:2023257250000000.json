		"title": "CVE-2023-25725 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "HAProxy before 2.7.3 may allow a bypass of access control because HTTP/1 headers are inadvertently lost in some situations, aka \"request smuggling.\" The HTTP header parsers in HAProxy may accept empty header field names, which could be used to truncate the list of HTTP headers and thus make some headers disappear after being parsed and processed for HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the impact is limited because the headers disappear before being parsed and processed, as if they had not been sent by the client. The fixed versions are 2.7.3, 2.6.9, 2.5.12, 2.4.22, 2.2.29, and 2.0.31.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25725` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhaproxy - 2.4.18-1ubuntu1.2\nvim-haproxy - 2.4.18-1ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
