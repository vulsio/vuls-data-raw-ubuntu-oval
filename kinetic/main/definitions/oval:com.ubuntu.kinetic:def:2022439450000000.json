		"title": "CVE-2022-43945 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
		"description": "The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and 6.0.2 are vulnerable to buffer overflow. NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force the send buffer to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message. The RPC message with garbage data is still correctly formed according to the specification and is passed forward to handlers. Vulnerable code in NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the allocated buffer space. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some RPC messages, leading to a buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-43945` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-26.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1012.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1012.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1009.16\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1009.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1009.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-26.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1012.13\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1012.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required",
