		"Title": "CVE-2022-3545 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function area_cache_get of the file drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the Netronome Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3545` to fix the vulnerability.
