		"Title": "CVE-2022-42328 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329). It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend driver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42328` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1015.22\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1015.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required",
