		"title": "CVE-2020-36326 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar Deserialization via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-36326` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibphp-phpmailer - 6.6.3-1\nNo subscription required",
