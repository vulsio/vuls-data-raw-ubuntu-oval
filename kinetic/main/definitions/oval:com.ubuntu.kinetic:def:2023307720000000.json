    "Title": "CVE-2023-30772 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before 6.2.9 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in drivers/power/supply/da9150-charger.c if a physically proximate attacker unplugs a device. It was discovered that the DA9150 charger driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
