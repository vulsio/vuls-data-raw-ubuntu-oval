		"title": "CVE-2023-3268 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "An out of bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel in relay_file_read_start_pos in kernel/relay.c in the relayfs. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information. It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform certain buffer calculations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
