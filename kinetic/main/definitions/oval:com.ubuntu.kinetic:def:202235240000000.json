		"Title": "CVE-2022-3524 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function ipv6_renew_options of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211021 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3524` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-26.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1012.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1012.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1009.16\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1009.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1009.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-26.27\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-26.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1012.13\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1012.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required",
