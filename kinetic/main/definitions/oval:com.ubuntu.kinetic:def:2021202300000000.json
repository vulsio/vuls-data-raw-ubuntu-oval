		"description": "A flaw was found in stunnel before 5.57, where it improperly validates client certificates when it is configured to use both redirect and verifyChain options. This flaw allows an attacker with a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority, which is not the one accepted by the stunnel server, to access the tunneled service instead of being redirected to the address specified in the redirect option. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-20230` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nstunnel4 - 3:5.63-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
