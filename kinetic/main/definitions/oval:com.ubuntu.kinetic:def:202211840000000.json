		"description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernelâ€™s filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1184` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-28.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1014.15\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1014.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1011.18\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1011.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1011.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-28.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1014.15\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1014.16\nNo subscription required",
