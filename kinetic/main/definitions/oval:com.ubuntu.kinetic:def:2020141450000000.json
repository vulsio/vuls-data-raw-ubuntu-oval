    "Title": "CVE-2020-14145 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
    "Description": "The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client). NOTE: some reports state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-14145` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7.3\nopenssh-server - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7.3\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7.3\nopenssh-tests - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7.3\nssh - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7.3\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7.3\nNo subscription required",

Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur> Per the advisory, \"The developers of OpenSSH are not planning to change the behavior of OpenSSH regarding this issue\" We will not be releasing updates for Ubuntu for this issue.  On 2020-12-02, it was announced that a partial mitigation has been commited by OpenSSH developers: https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/02/1 sbeattie> partial mitigation landed in openssh 8.4p1 litios> OpenSSH cannot be patch to fully mitigate this CVE as patching it would disable the reordering of host key algorithms, breaking RFC 4253. The partial mitigation disables this reordering only in a single specific situation. Marking as deferred. ccdm94> patching this issue in trusty and xenial has been considered risky. Therefore, these releases will be marked as ignored."
