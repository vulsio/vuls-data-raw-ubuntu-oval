		"Title": "CVE-2022-4139 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An incorrect TLB flush issue was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s GPU i915 kernel driver, potentially leading to random memory corruption or data leaks. This flaw could allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4139` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1014.21\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1014.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required",
