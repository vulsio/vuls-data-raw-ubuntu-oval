		"title": "CVE-2023-28866 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel through 6.2.8, net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c allows out-of-bounds access because amp_init1[] and amp_init2[] are supposed to have an intentionally invalid element, but do not. It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize some data structures, leading to an out-of-bounds access vulnerability in certain situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
