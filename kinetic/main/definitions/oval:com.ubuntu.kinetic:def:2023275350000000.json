		"title": "CVE-2023-27535 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the FTP connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-27535` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.85.0-1ubuntu0.5\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.85.0-1ubuntu0.5\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.85.0-1ubuntu0.5\nlibcurl4 - 7.85.0-1ubuntu0.5\nNo subscription required",
