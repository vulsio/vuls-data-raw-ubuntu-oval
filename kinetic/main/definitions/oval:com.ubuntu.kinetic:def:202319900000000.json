		"title": "CVE-2023-1990 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in ndlc_remove in drivers/nfc/st-nci/ndlc.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow an attacker to crash the system due to a race problem. It was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1990` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-47.49\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-47.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-47.49\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-47.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-47.49\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-47.49\nNo subscription required",
