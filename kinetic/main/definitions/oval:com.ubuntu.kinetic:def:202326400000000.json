    "Title": "CVE-2023-2640 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
    "Description": "On Ubuntu kernels carrying both c914c0e27eb0 and \"UBUNTU: SAUCE: overlayfs: Skip permission checking for trusted.overlayfs.* xattrs\", an unprivileged user may set privileged extended attributes on the mounted files, leading them to be set on the upper files without the appropriate security checks. Stonejiajia, Shir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.",
