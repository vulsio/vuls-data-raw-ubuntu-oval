		"description": "send_email in graphite-web/webapp/graphite/composer/views.py in Graphite through 1.1.5 is vulnerable to SSRF. The vulnerable SSRF endpoint can be used by an attacker to have the Graphite web server request any resource. The response to this SSRF request is encoded into an image file and then sent to an e-mail address that can be supplied by the attacker. Thus, an attacker can exfiltrate any information. It was discovered that Graphite insecurely handled certain crafted input on the send_email functionality. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to exfiltrate sensitive information, resulting in a SSRF attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-18638` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngraphite-web - 1.1.4-5\nNo subscription required",
