		"title": "CVE-2023-1380 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
		"description": "A slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service. It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1380` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-43.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1026.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1024.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1019.26\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1019.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-43.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1026.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1024.27\nNo subscription required",
