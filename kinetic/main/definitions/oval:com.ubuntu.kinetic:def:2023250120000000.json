		"Title": "CVE-2023-25012 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"Description": "The Linux kernel through 6.1.9 has a Use-After-Free in bigben_remove in drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c via a crafted USB device because the LED controllers remain registered for too long. It was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25012` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1021.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1021.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required",
