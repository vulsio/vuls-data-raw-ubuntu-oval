		"description": "An issue was discovered in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The faad_resetbits function in libfaad/bits.c is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability. The number of bits to be read is determined by ld->buffer_size - words*4, cast to uint32. If ld->buffer_size - words*4 is negative, a buffer overflow is later performed via getdword_n(&ld->start[words], ld->bytes_left). It was discovered that Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 incorrectly handled certain mp4 files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-15296` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfaad - 2.8.8-3ubuntu3\nlibfaad2 - 2.8.8-3ubuntu3\nNo subscription required",
