		"Title": "CVE-2023-1195 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in reconn_set_ipaddr_from_hostname in fs/cifs/connect.c in the Linux kernel. The issue occurs when it forgets to set the free pointer server->hostname to NULL, leading to an invalid pointer request. It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a user-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1195` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1015.22\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1015.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required",
