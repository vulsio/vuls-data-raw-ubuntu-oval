		"title": "CVE-2017-1002201 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "In haml versions prior to version 5.0.0.beta.2, when using user input to perform tasks on the server, characters like < > \" ' must be escaped properly. In this case, the ' character was missed. An attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code. It was discovered that Haml did not properly escape the ' character. If Haml were made to process crafted data, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1002201` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-haml - 5.0.4-3\nNo subscription required",
