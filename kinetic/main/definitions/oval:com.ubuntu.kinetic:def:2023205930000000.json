	"notes": {
		"Note": "alexmurray> In Ubuntu the linux-firmware source package does not ship the AMD microcode - instead this is contained within the amd64-microcode source package. There is also an associated patch for the Linux kernel to add a new chicken-bit which will automatically be set to enable a fallback workaround in the kernel in the case that the associated microcode is not available. Finally, the updates released by AMD on 2023-07-24 only cover Rome / Castle Peak and Mendocino designs - updates for consumer oriented designs like Matisse, Renoir etc are expected later in the year."
