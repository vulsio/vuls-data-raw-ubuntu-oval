    "Title": "CVE-2023-1079 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the LED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data. It was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1079` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1021.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1021.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required",
