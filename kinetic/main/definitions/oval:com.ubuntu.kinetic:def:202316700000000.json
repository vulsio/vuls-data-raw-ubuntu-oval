		"Title": "CVE-2023-1670 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet driver was found.A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1670` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1021.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1021.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required",
