		"title": "CVE-2019-9514 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both. It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9514` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nh2o - 2.2.5+dfsg2-3\nlibh2o-evloop0.13 - 2.2.5+dfsg2-3\nlibh2o0.13 - 2.2.5+dfsg2-3\nNo subscription required\n\ntrafficserver - 8.0.5+ds-1\ntrafficserver-experimental-plugins - 8.0.5+ds-1\nNo subscription required\n\npython3-twisted - 18.9.0-6ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
