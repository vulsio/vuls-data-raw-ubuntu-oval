		"title": "CVE-2023-0386 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s OverlayFS subsystem in how a user copies a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0386` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-41.42\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-41.42\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-41.42\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-41.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1021.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1023.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1022.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1017.24\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1017.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-41.42\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-41.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1021.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1023.24\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1022.25\nNo subscription required",
