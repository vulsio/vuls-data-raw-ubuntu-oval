		"Title": "CVE-2023-3389 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring subsystem can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Racing a io_uring cancel poll request with a linked timeout can cause a UAF in a hrtimer. We recommend upgrading past commit ef7dfac51d8ed961b742218f526bd589f3900a59 (4716c73b188566865bdd79c3a6709696a224ac04 for 5.10 stable and 0e388fce7aec40992eadee654193cad345d62663 for 5.15 stable). Querijn Voet discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
