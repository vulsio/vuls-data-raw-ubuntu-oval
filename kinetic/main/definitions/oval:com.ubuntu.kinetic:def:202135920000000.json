The flaw exists in the bootp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of the 'bootp_t' structure. A malicious guest could use this flaw to leak 10 bytes of uninitialized heap memory from the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp versions prior to 4.6.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3592` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibslirp0 - 4.6.1-1\nNo subscription required",
