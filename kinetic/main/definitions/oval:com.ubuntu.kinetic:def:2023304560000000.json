		"title": "CVE-2023-30456 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in arch/x86/kvm/vmx/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.8. nVMX on x86_64 lacks consistency checks for CR0 and CR4. Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-30456` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-43.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1026.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1024.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1019.26\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1019.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-43.44\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-43.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1026.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1025.27\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1023.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1025.26\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1024.27\nNo subscription required",
