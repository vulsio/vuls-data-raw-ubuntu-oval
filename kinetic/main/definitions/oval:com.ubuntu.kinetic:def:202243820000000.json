    "Title": "CVE-2022-4382 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw caused by a race among the superblock operations in the gadgetfs Linux driver was found. It could be triggered by yanking out a device that is running the gadgetfs side. Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4382` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1015.22\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1015.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-38.39\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-38.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1019.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1021.22\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1019.22\nNo subscription required",
