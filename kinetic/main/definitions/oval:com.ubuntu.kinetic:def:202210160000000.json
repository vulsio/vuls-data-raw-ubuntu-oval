    "Title": "CVE-2022-1016 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle 'return' with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker. David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1016` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.15.0-27.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.15.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.15.0-27.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.15.0-1004.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.15.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.15.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.15.0-1006.6\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.15.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.15.0-27.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.15.0-27.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.15.0-1004.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.15.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.15.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required",
