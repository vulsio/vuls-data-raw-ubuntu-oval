		"title": "CVE-2021-3448 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3448` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.85-1ubuntu1\ndnsmasq-base - 2.85-1ubuntu1\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.85-1ubuntu1\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.85-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",

		"note": "mdeslaur> This issue only affects dnsmasq in non-default configurations where the server=<address>@<interface> option is used. In those environments, this issue can be prevented by disabling cache by also using a cache-size=0 configuration option.  For the dnsmasq instance used by Network-Manager, it is not vulnerable to this issue as Ubuntu disables caching by default. (See Update-dnsmasq-parameters.patch in the network-manager package)"
