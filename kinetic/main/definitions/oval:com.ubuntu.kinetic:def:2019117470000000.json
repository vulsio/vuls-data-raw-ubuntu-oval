		"description": "The \"Forget about this site\" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-11747` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 69.0.1+build1-0ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
