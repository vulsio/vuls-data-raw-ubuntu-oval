		"Title": "CVE-2023-26544 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is a use-after-free in run_unpack in fs/ntfs3/run.c, related to a difference between NTFS sector size and media sector size. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of attributes when parsing MFT. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-26544` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1023.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1018.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1018.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-42.43\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-42.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1026.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1024.25\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1023.26\nNo subscription required",
