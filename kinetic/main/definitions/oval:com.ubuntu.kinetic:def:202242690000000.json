    "Title": "CVE-2022-4269 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action \"mirred\") a local unprivileged user could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition. William Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4269` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1021.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1021.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required",
