    "Title": "CVE-2023-26607 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_attr_find in fs/ntfs/attrib.c. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-26607` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1014.21\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1014.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-35.36\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-35.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1018.19\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required",
