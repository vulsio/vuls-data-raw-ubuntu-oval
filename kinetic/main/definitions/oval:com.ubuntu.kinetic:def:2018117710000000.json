		"title": "CVE-2018-11771 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"description": "When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, the read method of Apache Commons Compress 1.7 to 1.17's ZipArchiveInputStream can fail to return the correct EOF indication after the end of the stream has been reached. When combined with a java.io.InputStreamReader this can lead to an infinite stream, which can be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' zip package.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-11771` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibcommons-compress-java - 1.18-1\nNo subscription required",
