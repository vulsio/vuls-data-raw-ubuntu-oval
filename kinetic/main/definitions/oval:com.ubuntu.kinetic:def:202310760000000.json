    "Title": "CVE-2023-1076 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters. It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1076` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1021.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1021.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-45.46\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-45.46\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1026.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1024.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1025.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1027.28\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1027.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required",
