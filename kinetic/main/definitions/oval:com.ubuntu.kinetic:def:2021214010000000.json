    "Title": "CVE-2021-21401 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in ansi C. In Nanopb before versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5, decoding a specifically formed message can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message type contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer field. If the message data first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such message data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This has been fixed in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5. See referenced GitHub Security Advisory for more information including workarounds.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21401` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnanopb - 0.4.6-1\nNo subscription required",
