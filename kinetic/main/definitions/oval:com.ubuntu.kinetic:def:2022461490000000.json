		"title": "CVE-2022-46149 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"description": "Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and remote procedure call (RPC) system. Cap'n Proro prior to versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3, as well as versions of Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation prior to 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error handling list-of-list. This issue may lead someone to remotely segfault a peer by sending it a malicious message, if the victim performs certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. Exfiltration of memory is possible if the victim performs additional certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. To be vulnerable, an application must perform a specific sequence of actions, described in the GitHub Security Advisory. The bug is present in inlined code, therefore the fix will require rebuilding dependent applications. Cap'n Proto has C++ fixes available in versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3. The `capnp` Rust crate has fixes available in versions 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2.",

At present, we are not aware of any vulnerable application, but we advise updating regardless.\" capnproto is in main in bionic and focal only, and the only reverse depends in main is mir  The upstream fix introduces changes both to inline code and to the library which means fixing this will break ABI. Due to the likelyhood of breaking applications, and the fact that it is unlikely applications do the specific sequence of actions to trigger this vulnerability, we will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu."
