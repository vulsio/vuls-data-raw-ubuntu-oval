		"title": "CVE-2022-3541 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function spl2sw_nvmem_get_mac_address of the file drivers/net/ethernet/sunplus/spl2sw_driver.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211041 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the Sunplus Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained a read-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory)\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3541` to fix the vulnerability.
