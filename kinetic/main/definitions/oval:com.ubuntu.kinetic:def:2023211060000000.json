    "Title": "CVE-2023-21106 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - high.",
    "Description": "In adreno_set_param of adreno_gpu.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a double free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-265016072References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that a race condition existed in Adreno GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a double-free vulnerability.
