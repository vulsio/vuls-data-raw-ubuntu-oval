		"title": "CVE-2022-23639 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scoped threads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust. crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23639` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 1:1snap1-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\ngir1.2-rsvg-2.0 - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nlibrsvg2-2 - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nlibrsvg2-bin - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nlibrsvg2-common - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nNo subscription required",
