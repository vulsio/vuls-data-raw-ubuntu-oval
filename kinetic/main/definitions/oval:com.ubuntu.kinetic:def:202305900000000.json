    "Title": "CVE-2023-0590 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux Kernel due to a race problem. This flaw leads to a denial of service issue. If patch ebda44da44f6 (\"net: sched: fix race condition in qdisc_graft()\") not applied yet, then kernel could be affected. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0590` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-31.32\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-31.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-31.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-31.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1013.20\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1013.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-31.32\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-31.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1019.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1020.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1018.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1017.18\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required",
