		"Title": "CVE-2022-3903 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
		"Description": "An incorrect read request flaw was found in the Infrared Transceiver USB driver in the Linux kernel. This issue occurs when a user attaches a malicious USB device. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources, causing denial of service or potentially crashing the system. It was discovered that the infrared transceiver USB driver did not properly handle USB control messages. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3903` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-28.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1014.15\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1014.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1011.18\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1011.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1011.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-28.29\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-28.29\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1014.15\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1014.16\nNo subscription required",
