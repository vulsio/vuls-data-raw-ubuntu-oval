		"description": "Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14 and later versions. Kyle Zeng discovered that the Network Queuing and Scheduling subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29581` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-10.10\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-10.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-10.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-10.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-10.10\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-10.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required",
