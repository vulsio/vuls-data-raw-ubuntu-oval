    "Title": "CVE-2020-15114 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, the etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15114` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\netcd - 3.3.23\netcd-client - 3.3.23\netcd-server - 3.3.23\nNo subscription required",
