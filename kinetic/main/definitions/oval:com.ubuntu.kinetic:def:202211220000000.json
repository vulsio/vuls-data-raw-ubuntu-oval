    "Title": "CVE-2022-1122 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the opj2_decompress program in openjpeg2 2.4.0 in the way it handles an input directory with a large number of files. When it fails to allocate a buffer to store the filenames of the input directory, it calls free() on an uninitialized pointer, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial of service.",

    "Note": "mdeslaur> this only affects the opj_decompress tool in the liopenjp2-tools universe package ccdm94> this issue does not affect package openjpeg (versions 1.x) as the code that causes the uninitialized pointer to be freed was introduced by PR https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/pull/740. The code does contain memory leak problems, but since nothing is freed, the vulnerability in this case does not exist."
