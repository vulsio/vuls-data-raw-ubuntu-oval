    "Title": "CVE-2022-47929 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with \"tc qdisc\" and \"tc class\" commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c. It was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-47929` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1025-ibm - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1016.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1016.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-ibm - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required",
