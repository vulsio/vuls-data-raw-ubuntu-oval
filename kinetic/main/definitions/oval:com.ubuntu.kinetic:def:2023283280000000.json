    "Title": "CVE-2023-28328 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in the Linux Kernel. The message from user space is not checked properly before transferring into the device. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service. Wei Chen discovered that the DVB USB AZ6027 driver in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference when handling certain messages from user space. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-28328` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-46-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1029-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1027-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1028-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1026-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi - 5.19.0-1016.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1022-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1016.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1021-generic - 5.19.0-1016.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic - 5.19.0-40.41\nlinux-image-5.19.0-23-generic-64k - 5.19.0-40.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1011-aws - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1023.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-gcp - 5.19.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-kvm - 5.19.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1022.23\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1010-oracle - 5.19.0-1020.23\nNo subscription required",
