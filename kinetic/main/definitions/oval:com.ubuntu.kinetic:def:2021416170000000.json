    "Description": "sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41617` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7\nopenssh-server - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7\nopenssh-tests - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7\nssh - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:9.0p1-1ubuntu7\nNo subscription required",
