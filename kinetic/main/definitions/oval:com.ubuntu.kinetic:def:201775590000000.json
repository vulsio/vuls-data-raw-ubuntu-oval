		"description": "In Undertow 2.x before 2.0.0.Alpha2, 1.4.x before 1.4.17.Final, and 1.3.x before 1.3.31.Final, it was found that the fix for CVE-2017-2666 was incomplete and invalid characters are still allowed in the query string and path parameters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-7559` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibundertow-java - 1.4.23-3\nNo subscription required",
