		"title": "CVE-2022-45061 on Ubuntu 22.10 (kinetic) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45061` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nidle-python3.10 - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\nlibpython3.10 - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\nlibpython3.10-minimal - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\nlibpython3.10-stdlib - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\nlibpython3.10-testsuite - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\npython3.10 - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\npython3.10-examples - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\npython3.10-full - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\npython3.10-minimal - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\npython3.10-nopie - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\npython3.10-venv - 3.10.7-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
