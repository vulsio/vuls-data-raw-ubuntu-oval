    "Title": "CVE-2021-3753 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access to vc_mode is not protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. It was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3753` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-lowlatency - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-lowlatency - 4.15.0-162.170\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-aws - 4.15.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1059-aws - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-dell300x - 4.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-gcp - 4.15.0-1111.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gcp - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-gke - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-gkeop - 5.4.0-1026.27~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-kvm - 4.15.0-1102.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-oracle - 4.15.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-oracle - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1046-raspi - 5.4.0-1046.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1098-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1098.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-4.15.0-162-lowlatency - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-generic - 4.15.0-162.170\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-162-lowlatency - 4.15.0-162.170\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-aws - 4.15.0-1115.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1059-aws - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-dell300x - 4.15.0-1030.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-gcp - 4.15.0-1111.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gcp - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-gke - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-gkeop - 5.4.0-1026.27~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-oracle - 4.15.0-1083.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-oracle - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1115.124\nNo subscription required",
