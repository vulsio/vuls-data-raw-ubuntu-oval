		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cgroup: Fix memory leak caused by missing cgroup_bpf_offlineWhen enabling CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF, kmemleak can be observed by runningthe command as below:    $mount -t cgroup -o none,name=foo cgroup cgroup/    $umount cgroup/unreferenced object 0xc3585c40 (size 64):  comm \"mount\", pid 425, jiffies 4294959825 (age 31.990s)  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    01 00 00 80 84 8c 28 c0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ......(.........    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 6c 43 a0 c3 00 00 00 00  ........lC......  backtrace:    [<e95a2f9e>] cgroup_bpf_inherit+0x44/0x24c    [<1f03679c>] cgroup_setup_root+0x174/0x37c    [<ed4b0ac5>] cgroup1_get_tree+0x2c0/0x4a0    [<f85b12fd>] vfs_get_tree+0x24/0x108    [<f55aec5c>] path_mount+0x384/0x988    [<e2d5e9cd>] do_mount+0x64/0x9c    [<208c9cfe>] sys_mount+0xfc/0x1f4    [<06dd06e0>] ret_fast_syscall+0x0/0x48    [<a8308cb3>] 0xbeb4daa8This is because that since the commit 2b0d3d3e4fcf (\"percpu_ref: reducememory footprint of percpu_ref in fast path\") root_cgrp->bpf.refcnt.datais allocated by the function percpu_ref_init in cgroup_bpf_inherit whichis called by cgroup_setup_root when mounting, but not freed along withroot_cgrp when umounting. Adding cgroup_bpf_offline which callspercpu_ref_kill to cgroup_kill_sb can free root_cgrp->bpf.refcnt.data inumount path.This patch also fixes the commit 4bfc0bb2c60e (\"bpf: decouple the lifetimeof cgroup_bpf from cgroup itself\"). A cgroup_bpf_offline is needed to do acleanup that frees the resources which are allocated by cgroup_bpf_inheritin cgroup_setup_root.And inside cgroup_bpf_offline, cgroup_get() is at the beginning andcgroup_put is at the end of cgroup_bpf_release which is called bycgroup_bpf_offline. So cgroup_bpf_offline can keep the balance ofcgroup's refcount.",
