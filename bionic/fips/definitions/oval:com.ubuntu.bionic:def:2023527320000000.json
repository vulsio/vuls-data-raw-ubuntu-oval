		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ceph:blocklist the kclient when receiving corrupted snap trace When receivedcorrupted snap trace we don't know what exactly has happened in MDS side.And we shouldn't continue IOs and metadatas access to MDS, which maycorrupt or get incorrect contents. This patch will just block all thefurther IO/MDS requests immediately and then evict the kclient itself. Thereason why we still need to evict the kclient just after blocking all thefurther IOs is that the MDS could revoke the caps faster.",
