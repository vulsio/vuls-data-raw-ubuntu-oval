		"description": "There is a flaw in RPM's signature functionality. OpenPGP subkeys areassociated with a primary key via a \"binding signature.\" RPM does not checkthe binding signature of subkeys prior to importing them. If an attacker isable to add or socially engineer another party to add a malicious subkey toa legitimate public key, RPM could wrongly trust a malicious signature. Thegreatest impact of this flaw is to data integrity. To exploit this flaw, anattacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince anadministrator to install an untrusted RPM or public key. It is stronglyrecommended to only use RPMs and public keys from trusted sources.",
