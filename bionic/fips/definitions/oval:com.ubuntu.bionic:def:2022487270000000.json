		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: Avoid consuming a stale esr value when SError occur When anyexception other than an IRQ occurs, the CPU updates the ESR_EL2 registerwith the exception syndrome. An SError may also become pending, and will besynchronised by KVM. KVM notes the exception type, and whether an SErrorwas synchronised in exit_code. When an exception other than an IRQ occurs,fixup_guest_exit() updates vcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2 from the hardwareregister. When an SError was synchronised, the vcpu esr value is used todetermine if the exception was due to an HVC. If so, ELR_EL2 is moved backone instruction. This is so that KVM can process the SError first, andre-execute the HVC if the guest survives the SError. But if an IRQsynchronises an SError, the vcpu's esr value is stale. If the previousnon-IRQ exception was an HVC, KVM will corrupt ELR_EL2, causing anunrelated guest instruction to be executed twice. CheckARM_EXCEPTION_CODE() before messing with ELR_EL2, IRQs don't update thisregister so don't need to check.",
