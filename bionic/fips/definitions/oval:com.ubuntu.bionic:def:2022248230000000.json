		"Description": "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network applicationframework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty'smultipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via thelocal system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the diskis enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 andlower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-likesystems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share thesystem temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final containsa patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own`java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or useDefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to somethingthat is only readable by the current user.",
