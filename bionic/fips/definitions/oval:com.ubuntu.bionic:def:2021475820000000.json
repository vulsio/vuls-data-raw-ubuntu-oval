		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:core: Make do_proc_control() and do_proc_bulk() killable TheUSBDEVFS_CONTROL and USBDEVFS_BULK ioctls invoke usb_start_wait_urb(),which contains an uninterruptible wait with a user-specified timeout value.If timeout value is very large and the device being accessed does notrespond in a reasonable amount of time, the kernel will complain about\"Task X blocked for more than N seconds\", as found in testing by syzbot:INFO: task syz-executor.0:8700 blocked for more than 143 seconds. Nottainted 5.14.0-rc7-syzkaller #0 \"echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.task:syz-executor.0 state:D stack:23192 pid: 8700 ppid: 8455flags:0x00004004 Call Trace: context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:4681[inline] __schedule+0xc07/0x11f0 kernel/sched/core.c:5938schedule+0x14b/0x210 kernel/sched/core.c:6017 schedule_timeout+0x98/0x2f0kernel/time/timer.c:1857 do_wait_for_common+0x2da/0x480kernel/sched/completion.c:85 __wait_for_commonkernel/sched/completion.c:106 [inline] wait_for_commonkernel/sched/completion.c:117 [inline]wait_for_completion_timeout+0x46/0x60 kernel/sched/completion.c:157usb_start_wait_urb+0x167/0x550 drivers/usb/core/message.c:63do_proc_bulk+0x978/0x1080 drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1236 proc_bulkdrivers/usb/core/devio.c:1273 [inline] usbdev_do_ioctldrivers/usb/core/devio.c:2547 [inline] usbdev_ioctl+0x3441/0x6b10drivers/usb/core/devio.c:2713 ... To fix this problem, this patch replacesusbfs's calls to usb_control_msg() and usb_bulk_msg() with special-purposecode that does essentially the same thing (as recommended in the commentfor usb_start_wait_urb()), except that it always uses a killable wait andit uses GFP_KERNEL rather than GFP_NOIO.",
