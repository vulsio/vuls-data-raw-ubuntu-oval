    "Title": "CVE-2022-1789 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "With shadow paging enabled, the INVPCID instruction results in a call to kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva. If INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0, the invlpg callback is not set and the result is a NULL pointer dereference. Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1789` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1066-raspi - 5.4.0-1066.76~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required",
