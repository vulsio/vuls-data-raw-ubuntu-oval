		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: clean up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot deleteIn reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could be unkind since we aren'tholding a lock on the extent leaf and thus could get a transientincorrect answer.  In walk_down_proc we also BUG_ON(refs == 0), whichcould happen if we have extent tree corruption.  Change that to return-EUCLEAN.  In do_walk_down() we catch this case and handle it correctly,however we return -EIO, which -EUCLEAN is a more appropriate error code.Finally in walk_up_proc we have the same BUG_ON(refs == 0), so convertthat to proper error handling.  Also adjust the error message so we canactually do something with the information.",
