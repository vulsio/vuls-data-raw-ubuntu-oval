    "Title": "CVE-2020-24394 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.7.8, fs/nfsd/vfs.c (in the NFS server) can set incorrect permissions on new filesystem objects when the filesystem lacks ACL support, aka CID-22cf8419f131. This occurs because the current umask is not considered. It was discovered that the NFS server implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly honor umask settings when setting permissions while creating file system objects if the underlying file system did not support ACLs. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or violate system integrity.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-24394` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1080-aws - 4.15.0-1080.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1033-aws - 5.3.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-azure - 4.15.0-1093.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1035-azure - 5.3.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-gcp - 4.15.0-1081.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1067-gke - 4.15.0-1067.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1033-gke - 5.3.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-65-generic - 5.3.0-65.59\nlinux-image-5.3.0-65-lowlatency - 5.3.0-65.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-65-generic - 5.3.0-65.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-65-lowlatency - 5.3.0-65.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1072-kvm - 4.15.0-1072.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-oem - 4.15.0-1094.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-oracle - 4.15.0-1051.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1016-raspi - 5.4.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1068-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1068.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1032-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1032.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1080-aws - 4.15.0-1080.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-azure - 4.15.0-1093.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1035-azure - 5.3.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-gcp - 4.15.0-1081.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1067-gke - 4.15.0-1067.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1033-gke - 5.3.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-65-generic - 5.3.0-65.59\nlinux-image-5.3.0-65-lowlatency - 5.3.0-65.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-65-generic - 5.3.0-65.59\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-65-lowlatency - 5.3.0-65.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-oem - 4.15.0-1094.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-oracle - 4.15.0-1051.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1084-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required",
