		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappings Patchseries \"nilfs2: fix kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()\". This resolves a kernelBUG reported by syzbot. Since there are two flaws involved, I've made eachone a separate patch. The first patch alone resolves the syzbot-reportedbug, but I think both fixes should be sent to stable, so I've tagged themas such. This patch (of 2): Syzbot has reported a kernel bug insubmit_bh_wbc() when writing file data to a nilfs2 file system whosemetadata is corrupted. There are two flaws involved in this issue. Thefirst flaw is that when nilfs_get_block() locates a data block using btreeor direct mapping, if the disk address translation routinenilfs_dat_translate() fails with internal code -ENOENT due to DAT metadatacorruption, it can be passed back to nilfs_get_block(). This causesnilfs_get_block() to misidentify an existing block as non-existent, causingboth data block lookup and insertion to fail inconsistently. The secondflaw is that nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status in thisinconsistent state. This causes the caller __block_write_begin_int() orothers to request a read even though the buffer is not mapped, resulting ina BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc() failing. Thisfixes the first issue by changing the return value to code -EINVAL when aconversion using DAT fails with code -ENOENT, avoiding the conflictingcondition that leads to the kernel bug described above. Here, code -EINVALindicates that metadata corruption was detected during the block lookup,which will be properly handled as a file system error and converted to -EIOwhen passing through the nilfs2 bmap layer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26956` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1133-azure - 5.4.0-1133.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-gcp - 5.4.0-1132.141~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-ibm - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-oracle - 5.4.0-1127.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
