		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: dvb-usb-v2: af9035: Fix null-ptr-deref in af9035_i2c_master_xferIn af9035_i2c_master_xfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].bufis null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would bepassed. Malicious data finally reach af9035_i2c_master_xfer. If accessingmsg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.Similar commit:commit 0ed554fd769a(\"media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()\")",
