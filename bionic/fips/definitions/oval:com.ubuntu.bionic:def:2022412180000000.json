		"Title": "CVE-2022-41218 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41218` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-aws - 4.15.0-1153.166\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1062-dell300x - 4.15.0-1062.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1147-gcp - 4.15.0-1147.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1137-kvm - 4.15.0-1137.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-oracle - 4.15.0-1116.127\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1081-raspi - 5.4.0-1081.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1129-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1129.137\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-aws - 4.15.0-1153.166\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1062-dell300x - 4.15.0-1062.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1147-gcp - 4.15.0-1147.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-oracle - 4.15.0-1116.127\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1148-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1148.158\nNo subscription required",
