ZSTD_getCParams_internal+0x220/0x220 kthread+0xdc/0x120 ? __btf_name_valid+0xa0/0xa0 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30This is because we're completing the nfs_direct_request twice in a row.The source of this is when we have our commit requests to submit, weprocess them and send them off, and then in the completion path for thecommit requests we haveif (nfs_commit_end(cinfo.mds))\tnfs_direct_write_complete(dreq);However since we're submitting asynchronous requests we sometimes haveone that completes before we submit the next one, so we end up callingcomplete on the nfs_direct_request twice.The only other place we use nfs_generic_commit_list() is in__nfs_commit_inode, which wraps this call in anfs_commit_begin();nfs_commit_end();Which is a common pattern for this style of completion handling, onethat is also repeated in the direct code with get_dreq()/put_dreq()calls around where we process events as well as in the completion paths.Fix this by using the same pattern for the commit requests.Before with my 200 node rocksdb stress running this warning would popevery 10ish minutes.  With my patch the stress test has been running forseveral hours without popping.",
