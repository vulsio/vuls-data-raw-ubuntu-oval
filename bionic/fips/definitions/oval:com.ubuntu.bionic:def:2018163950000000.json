		"description": "An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby before 2.3.8, 2.4.xbefore 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3. When twoOpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending on theordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is onecharacter longer than the second, or the second argument contains acharacter that is one less than a character in the same position of thefirst argument, the result of == will be true. This could be leveraged tocreate an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate andthen used in signing or encryption operations.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-16395` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.1\nruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
