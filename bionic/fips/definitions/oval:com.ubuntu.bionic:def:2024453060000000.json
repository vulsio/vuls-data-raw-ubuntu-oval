		"description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimizedhow the cursor position is calculated and removed a loop, that verifiedthat the cursor position always points inside a line and does not becomeinvalid by pointing beyond the end ofa line. Back then we assumed this loop is unnecessary. However, this changemade it possible that the cursor position stays invalid and points beyondthe end of a line, which would eventually cause a heap-buffer-overflow whentrying to access the line pointer atthe specified cursor position. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead tothis situation that the cursor points to an invalid position. That's whypatch v9.1.0707 does not include a test case. The only observed impact hasbeen a program crash. This issue has been addressed in with the patchv9.1.0707. All users are advised to upgrade.",
