This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put andep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try tohold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still aliveand we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false,it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, andwe should skip it.In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different fromtsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled offbefore calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep isthe same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc,and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as theport release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu().Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk byasoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().Thanks Jones to bring this issue up.v1->v2:  - improve the changelog.  - add kfree(ep) into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed.",
