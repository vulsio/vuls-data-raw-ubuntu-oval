		"Title": "CVE-2022-4450 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses anddecodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payloaddata. If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\"arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevantdecoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It ispossible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data.In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populatethe header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. Thiswill most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attackerwho has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve adenial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() aresimple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions arealso directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by anumber of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() andSSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSLinternal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller doesnot free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code.These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as thedecoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command lineapplication is also impacted by this issue.",
