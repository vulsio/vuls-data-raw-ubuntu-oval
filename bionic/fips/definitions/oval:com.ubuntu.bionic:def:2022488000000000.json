		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: vmscan: remove deadlock due to throttling failing to make progressA soft lockup bug in kcompactd was reported in a private bugzilla withthe following visible in dmesg;  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 26s! [kcompactd0:479]  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 52s! [kcompactd0:479]  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 78s! [kcompactd0:479]  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#33 stuck for 104s!

The root of theproblem is that kcompact0 is not rescheduling on a CPU while a task thathas isolated a large number of the pages from the LRU is waiting onkcompact0 to reschedule so the pages can be released.  Whileshrink_inactive_list() only loops once around too_many_isolated, reclaimcan continue without rescheduling if sc->skipped_deactivate == 1 whichcould happen if there was no file LRU and the inactive anon list was notlow.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48800` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1001-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1001-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
