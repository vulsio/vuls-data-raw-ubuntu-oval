		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ASoC:qcom: Fix uninitialized pointer dmactl In the case where__lpass_get_dmactl_handle is called and the driver id dai_id is invalid thepointer dmactl is not being assigned a value, and dmactl contains a garbagevalue since it has not been initialized and so the null check may not work.Fix this to initialize dmactl to NULL. One could argue that moderncompilers will set this to zero, but it is useful to keep this initializedas per the same way in functions __lpass_platform_codec_intf_init andlpass_cdc_dma_daiops_hw_params. Cleans up clang scan build warning:sound/soc/qcom/lpass-cdc-dma.c:275:7: warning: Branch condition evaluatesto a garbage value [core.uninitialized.Branch]",
