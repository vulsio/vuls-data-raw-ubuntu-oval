		"Title": "CVE-2022-29581 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - high.",
		"Description": "Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14 and later versions. Kyle Zeng discovered that the Network Queuing and Scheduling subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29581` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-180-generic - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-4.15.0-180-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-4.15.0-180-lowlatency - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-180-generic - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-180-lowlatency - 4.15.0-180.189\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-aws - 4.15.0-1130.139\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-azure - 4.15.0-1139.152\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-azure - 5.4.0-1080.83~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-gcp - 4.15.0-1124.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-gcp - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-gke - 5.4.0-1072.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gkeop - 5.4.0-1043.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-lowlatency - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-lowlatency - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-ibm - 5.4.0-1023.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-kvm - 4.15.0-1116.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1095-oracle - 4.15.0-1095.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-oracle - 5.4.0-1073.79~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1062-raspi - 5.4.0-1062.70~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1111.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-180-generic - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-4.15.0-180-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-4.15.0-180-lowlatency - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-180-generic - 4.15.0-180.189\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-180-lowlatency - 4.15.0-180.189\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-aws - 4.15.0-1130.139\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-azure - 4.15.0-1139.152\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-azure - 5.4.0-1080.83~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-gcp - 4.15.0-1124.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-gcp - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1072-gke - 5.4.0-1072.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gkeop - 5.4.0-1043.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-113-lowlatency - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-generic - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-113-lowlatency - 5.4.0-113.127~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-ibm - 5.4.0-1023.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1095-oracle - 4.15.0-1095.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-oracle - 5.4.0-1073.79~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1129-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1129.138\nNo subscription required",
