		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: ll_temac: Make sure to free skb when it is completely usedWith the skb pointer piggy-backed on the TX BD, we have a simple andefficient way to free the skb buffer when the frame has been transmitted.But in order to avoid freeing the skb while there are still fragments fromthe skb in use, we need to piggy-back on the TX BD of the skb, not thefirst.Without this, we are doing use-after-free on the DMA side, when the firstBD of a multi TX BD packet is seen as completed in xmit_done, and theremaining BDs are still being processed.",
