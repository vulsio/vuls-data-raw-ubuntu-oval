		"Description": "A Privilege Context Switching issue was discovered in join.c in Firejail0.9.68. By crafting a bogus Firejail container that is accepted by theFirejail setuid-root program as a join target, a local attacker can enteran environment in which the Linux user namespace is still the initial usernamespace, the NO_NEW_PRIVS prctl is not activated, and the entered mountnamespace is under the attacker's control. In this way, the filesystemlayout can be adjusted to gain root privileges through execution ofavailable setuid-root binaries such as su or sudo.",
