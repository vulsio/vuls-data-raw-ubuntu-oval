		"Title": "CVE-2017-9229 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A SIGSEGV occurs in left_adjust_char_head() during regular expression compilation. Invalid handling of reg->dmax in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, normally as an immediate denial-of-service condition. It was discovered that Oniguruma incorrectly handled certain regular expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-9229` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibonig4 - 6.3.0-1\nNo subscription required",
