		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: set priv->pdev before using itpriv->pdev pointer was set after being used infsl_asoc_card_audmux_init().Move this assignment at the start of the probe function, sosub-functions can correctly use pdev through priv.fsl_asoc_card_audmux_init() dereferences priv->pdev to get access to thedev struct, used with dev_err macros.As priv is zero-initialised, there would be a NULL pointer dereference.Note that if priv->dev is dereferenced before assignment but never used,for example if there is no error to be printed, the driver won't crashprobably due to compiler optimisations.",
