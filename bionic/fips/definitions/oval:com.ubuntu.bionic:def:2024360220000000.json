		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: Init zone device and drm client after mode-1 reset on reloadIn passthrough environment, when amdgpu is reloaded after unload, mode-1is triggered after initializing the necessary IPs, That init does notinclude KFD, and KFD init waits until the reset is completed. KFD initis called in the reset handler, but in this case, the zone device anddrm client is not initialized, causing app to create kernel panic.v2: Removing the init KFD condition from amdgpu_amdkfd_drm_client_create.As the previous version has the potential of creating DRM client twice.v3: v2 patch results in SDMA engine hung as DRM open causes VM clear toSDMAbefore SDMA init. Adding the condition to in drm client creation, on top ofv1,to guard against drm client creation call multiple times.",
