		"title": "CVE-2024-40945 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu: Return right value in iommu_sva_bind_device()iommu_sva_bind_device() should return either a sva bond handle or anERR_PTR value in error cases. Existing drivers (idxd and uacce) onlycheck the return value with IS_ERR(). This could potentially lead toa kernel NULL pointer dereference issue if the function returns NULLinstead of an error pointer.In reality, this doesn't cause any problems because iommu_sva_bind_device()only returns NULL when the kernel is not configured with CONFIG_IOMMU_SVA.In this case, iommu_dev_enable_feature(dev, IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_SVA) willreturn an error, and the device drivers won't call iommu_sva_bind_device()at all.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40945` to fix the vulnerability.
