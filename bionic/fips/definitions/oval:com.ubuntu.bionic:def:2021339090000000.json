		"Title": "CVE-2021-33909 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - high.",
		"Description": "fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05. It was discovered that the virtual file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained an unsigned to signed integer conversion error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33909` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1054-aws - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-azure - 5.4.0-1055.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gcp - 5.4.0-1049.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1045-gke - 5.3.0-1045.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gke - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gkeop - 5.4.0-1021.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-76-generic - 5.3.0-76.72\nlinux-image-5.3.0-76-lowlatency - 5.3.0-76.72\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-76-generic - 5.3.0-76.72\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-76-lowlatency - 5.3.0-76.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-kvm - 4.15.0-1097.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-oracle - 5.4.0-1052.56~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1041-raspi - 5.4.0-1041.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1092-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1092.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1042-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1042.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1054-aws - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-azure - 5.4.0-1055.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gcp - 5.4.0-1049.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1045-gke - 5.3.0-1045.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gke - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gkeop - 5.4.0-1021.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-76-generic - 5.3.0-76.72\nlinux-image-5.3.0-76-lowlatency - 5.3.0-76.72\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-76-generic - 5.3.0-76.72\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-76-lowlatency - 5.3.0-76.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-oracle - 5.4.0-1052.56~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required",
