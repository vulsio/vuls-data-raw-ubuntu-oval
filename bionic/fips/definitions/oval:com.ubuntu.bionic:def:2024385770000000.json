		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rcu-tasks: Fix show_rcu_tasks_trace_gp_kthread buffer overflow There is apossibility of buffer overflow in show_rcu_tasks_trace_gp_kthread() ifcounters, passed to sprintf() are huge. Counter numbers, needed for thisare unrealistically high, but buffer overflow is still possible. Usesnprintf() with buffer size instead of sprintf(). Found by LinuxVerification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38577` to fix the vulnerability.
