    "Title": "CVE-2021-3739 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the btrfs_rm_device function in fs/btrfs/volumes.c in the Linux Kernel, where triggering the bug requires ‘CAP_SYS_ADMIN’. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly handle removing a non-existent device id. An attacker with CAP_SYS_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3739` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1059-aws - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gcp - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-gke - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-gkeop - 5.4.0-1026.27~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-oracle - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1046-raspi - 5.4.0-1046.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1059-aws - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-azure - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gcp - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-gke - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-gkeop - 5.4.0-1026.27~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-generic - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-90-lowlatency - 5.4.0-90.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-oracle - 5.4.0-1057.61~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required",
