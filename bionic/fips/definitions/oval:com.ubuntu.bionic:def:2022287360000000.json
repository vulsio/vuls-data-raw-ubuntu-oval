		"Description": "There's a use-after-free vulnerability in grub_cmd_chainloader() function; The chainloader command is used to boot up operating systems that doesn't support multiboot and do not have direct support from GRUB2. When executing chainloader more than once a use-after-free vulnerability is triggered. If an attacker can control the GRUB2's memory allocation pattern sensitive data may be exposed and arbitrary code execution can be achieved.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-28736` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.187.3~18.04.1\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.187.3~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\nNo subscription required",
