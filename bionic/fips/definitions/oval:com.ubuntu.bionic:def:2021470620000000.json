		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUs Use thekvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when encrypting VMSAs forSEV, which effectively switches to use online_vcpus instead ofcreated_vcpus. This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference ascreated_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists, since it is updated at thevery beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU. created_vcpus exists to allow the bulkof vCPU creation to run in parallel, while still correctly restricting themax number of max vCPUs.",
