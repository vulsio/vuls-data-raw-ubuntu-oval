		"description": "In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before version1.2.14 there is a credential leaking vulnerability. If a container imagemanifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 formatincludes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise knownas a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver will follow that URLto attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the defaultcontainerd resolver will provide its authentication credentials if theserver where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code along withregistry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker publishes a public imagewith a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a webserver they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image,they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases,this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In othercases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instancewhich can grant access to other cloud resources in the account. The defaultcontainerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be usedby Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs thathave explicitly linked against it. This vulnerability has been fixed incontainerd 1.2.14. containerd 1.3 and later are not affected. If you areusing containerd 1.3 or later, you are not affected. If you are usingcri-containerd in the 1.2 series or prior, you should ensure you only pullimages from trusted sources. Other container runtimes built on top ofcontainerd but not using the default resolver (such as Docker) are notaffected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15157` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndocker.io - 19.03.6-0ubuntu1~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
