		"Title": "CVE-2021-3764 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is similar to the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3764` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-aws - 4.15.0-1116.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-aws - 5.4.0-1060.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-azure - 5.4.0-1064.67~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-dell300x - 4.15.0-1031.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-gcp - 4.15.0-1112.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-gcp - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gke - 5.4.0-1056.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gkeop - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-kvm - 4.15.0-1103.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-oracle - 4.15.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-oracle - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1047-raspi - 5.4.0-1047.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1099.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-aws - 4.15.0-1116.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-aws - 5.4.0-1060.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-azure - 5.4.0-1064.67~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-dell300x - 4.15.0-1031.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-gcp - 4.15.0-1112.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-gcp - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gke - 5.4.0-1056.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gkeop - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-oracle - 4.15.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-oracle - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1116.125\nNo subscription required",
