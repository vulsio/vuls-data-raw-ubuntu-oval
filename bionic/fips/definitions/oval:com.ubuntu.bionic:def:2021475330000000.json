		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vc4: kms: Clear the HVS FIFO commit pointer once done Commit9ec03d7f1ed3 (\"drm/vc4: kms: Wait on previous FIFO users before a commit\")introduced a wait on the previous commit done on a given HVS FIFO. However,we never cleared that pointer once done. Since drm_crtc_commit_put can freethe drm_crtc_commit structure directly if we were the last user, this meansthat it can lead to a use-after free if we were to duplicate the state, andthat stale pointer would even be copied to the new state. Set the pointerto NULL once we're done with the wait so that we don't carry over a pointerto a free'd structure.",
