		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destructionMy previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race wherethe exact same deadlock (see the original commit referencedbelow) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() alreadyruns while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking someinterfaces as nl_owner_dead.The race happens because we have two loops here - first wedev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If wealso have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)then we can find one during the first iteration, close it,and go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and tryto destroy also the one we didn't close yet.Fix this by only iterating once.",
