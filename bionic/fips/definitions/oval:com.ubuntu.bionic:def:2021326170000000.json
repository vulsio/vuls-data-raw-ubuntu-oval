		"description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An inefficientalgorithm (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 andearlier. The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used to writemetadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploitthe vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick thevictim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed inversion v0.27.4. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ themetadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-lineapplication, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `rm`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32617` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nexiv2 - 0.25-3.1ubuntu0.18.04.9\nlibexiv2-14 - 0.25-3.1ubuntu0.18.04.9\nNo subscription required",
