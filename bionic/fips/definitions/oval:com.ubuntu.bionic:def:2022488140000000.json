		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: dsa: seville: register the mdiobus under devresAs explained in commits:74b6d7d13307 (\"net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres\")5135e96a3dd2 (\"net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres\")mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus wasnot previously unregistered.The Seville VSC9959 switch is a platform device, so the initial set ofconstraints that I thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call->remove on ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more whichapplies here.If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device linkbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()will unbind the seville switch driver on shutdown.So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, whichis: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,or don't use devres at all.The seville driver has a code structure that could accommodate both themdiobus_unregister and mdiobus_free calls, but it has an externaldependency upon mscc_miim_setup() from mdio-mscc-miim.c, which callsdevm_mdiobus_alloc_size() on its behalf. So rather than restructuringthat, and exporting yet one more symbol mscc_miim_teardown(), let's workwith devres and replace of_mdiobus_register with the devres variant.When we use all-devres, we can ensure that devres doesn't free astill-registered bus (it either runs both callbacks, or none).",
