		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:scsi_debug: Fix type in min_t to avoid stack OOB Change min_t() to use type\"u32\" instead of type \"int\" to avoid stack out of bounds. With min_t() type\"int\" the values get sign extended and the larger value gets used causingstack out of bounds.
