		"title": "CVE-2019-3570 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Call to the scrypt_enc() function in HHVM can lead to heap corruption byusing specifically crafted parameters (N, r and p). This happens if theparameters are configurable by an attacker for instance by providing theoutput of scrypt_enc() in a context where Hack/PHP code would attempt toverify it by re-running scrypt_enc() with the same parameters. This couldresult in information disclosure, memory being overwriten or crashes of theHHVM process. This issue affects versions 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0, 4.6.0,4.7.0, 4.8.0, versions 3.30.5 and below, and all versions in the 4.0, 4.1,and 4.2 series.",
