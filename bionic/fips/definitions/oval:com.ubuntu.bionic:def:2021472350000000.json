		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:ethernet: fix potential use-after-free in ec_bhf_remove static voidec_bhf_remove(struct pci_dev *dev) { ... struct ec_bhf_priv *priv =netdev_priv(net_dev); unregister_netdev(net_dev); free_netdev(net_dev);pci_iounmap(dev, priv->dma_io); pci_iounmap(dev, priv->io); ... } priv isnetdev private data, but it is used after free_netdev(). It can causeuse-after-free when accessing priv pointer. So, fix it by movingfree_netdev() after pci_iounmap() calls.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47235` to fix the vulnerability.
