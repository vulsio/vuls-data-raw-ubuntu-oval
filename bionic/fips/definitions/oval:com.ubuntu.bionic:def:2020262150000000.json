		"Description": "Jupyter Notebook before version 6.1.5 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to a different website. All notebook servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known notebook server hosts. A link to your notebook server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. The issue is patched in version 6.1.5.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26215` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njupyter-notebook - 5.2.2-1ubuntu0.1\npython-notebook - 5.2.2-1ubuntu0.1\npython3-notebook - 5.2.2-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
