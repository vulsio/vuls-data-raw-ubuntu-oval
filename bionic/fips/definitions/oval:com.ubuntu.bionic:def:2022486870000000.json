		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6:sr: fix out-of-bounds read when setting HMAC data. The SRv6 layer allowsdefining HMAC data that can later be used to sign IPv6 Segment RoutingHeaders. This configuration is realised via netlink through fourattributes: SEG6_ATTR_HMACKEYID, SEG6_ATTR_SECRET, SEG6_ATTR_SECRETLEN andSEG6_ATTR_ALGID. Because the SECRETLEN attribute is decoupled from theactual length of the SECRET attribute, it is possible to provide invalidcombinations (e.g., secret = \"\", secretlen = 64). This case is not checkedin the code and with an appropriately crafted netlink message, anout-of-bounds read of up to 64 bytes (max secret length) can occur past theskb end pointer and into skb_shared_info: Breakpoint 1, seg6_genl_sethmac(skb=<optimized out>, info=<optimized out>) at net/ipv6/seg6.c:208 208memcpy(hinfo->secret, secret, slen); (gdb) bt #0 seg6_genl_sethmac(skb=<optimized out>, info=<optimized out>) at net/ipv6/seg6.c:208 #10xffffffff81e012e9 in genl_family_rcv_msg_doit(skb=skb@entry=0xffff88800b1f9f00, nlh=nlh@entry=0xffff88800b1b7600,extack=extack@entry=0xffffc90000ba7af0, ops=ops@entry=0xffffc90000ba7a80,hdrlen=4, net=0xffffffff84237580 <init_net>, family=<optimized out>,family=<optimized out>) at net/netlink/genetlink.c:731 #20xffffffff81e01435 in genl_family_rcv_msg (extack=0xffffc90000ba7af0,nlh=0xffff88800b1b7600, skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00, family=0xffffffff82fef6c0<seg6_genl_family>) at net/netlink/genetlink.c:775 #3 genl_rcv_msg(skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00, nlh=0xffff88800b1b7600, extack=0xffffc90000ba7af0)at net/netlink/genetlink.c:792 #4 0xffffffff81dfffc3 in netlink_rcv_skb(skb=skb@entry=0xffff88800b1f9f00, cb=cb@entry=0xffffffff81e01350<genl_rcv_msg>) at net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2501 #5 0xffffffff81e00919 ingenl_rcv (skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00) at net/netlink/genetlink.c:803 #60xffffffff81dff6ae in netlink_unicast_kernel (ssk=0xffff888010eec800,skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00, sk=0xffff888004aed000) atnet/netlink/af_netlink.c:1319 #7 netlink_unicast(ssk=ssk@entry=0xffff888010eec800, skb=skb@entry=0xffff88800b1f9f00,portid=portid@entry=0, nonblock=<optimized out>) atnet/netlink/af_netlink.c:1345 #8 0xffffffff81dff9a4 in netlink_sendmsg(sock=<optimized out>, msg=0xffffc90000ba7e48, len=<optimized out>) atnet/netlink/af_netlink.c:1921 ...
