To avoid this, select the cpu with cpumask_any_and_distribute()to mask __pod_cpumask with cpu_online_mask. In case no cpu is left inthe pool, skip the assignment.tj: This doesn't fully fix the bug as CPUs can still go down betweenpickingthe target CPU and the wake call. Fixing that likely requires addingcpu_online() test to either the sched or s390 arch code. However,regardlessof how that is fixed, workqueue shouldn't be picking a CPU which isn'tonline as that would result in unpredictable and worse behavior.",
