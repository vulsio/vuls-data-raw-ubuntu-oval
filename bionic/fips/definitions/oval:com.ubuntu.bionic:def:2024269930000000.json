		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fs: sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection()The sysfs_break_active_protection() routine has an obvious referenceleak in its error path.  If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails thenkn will be NULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection()routine won't get called (and would only cause an access violation bytrying to dereference kn->parent if it was called).  As a result, thereference to kobj acquired at the start of the function will never bereleased.Fix the leak by adding an explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL.",
