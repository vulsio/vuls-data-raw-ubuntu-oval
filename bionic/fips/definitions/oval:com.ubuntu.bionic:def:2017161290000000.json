		"description": "The HTTP client module superagent is vulnerable to ZIP bomb attacks. In aZIP bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response thatbecomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed.

To exploit this the attacker must control thelocation (URL) that superagent makes a request to.",
