		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/srpt: Do not register event handler until srpt device is fully setupUpon rare occasions, KASAN reports a use-after-free Write insrpt_refresh_port(). This seems to be because an event handler isregistered before the srpt device is fully setup and a race condition uponerror may leave a partially setup event handler in place. Instead, onlyregister the event handler after srpt device initialization is complete.",
