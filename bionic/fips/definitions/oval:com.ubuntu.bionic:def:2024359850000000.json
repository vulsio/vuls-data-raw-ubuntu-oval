		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/eevdf: Prevent vlag from going out of bounds in reweight_eevdf()It was possible to have pick_eevdf() return NULL, which then causes aNULL-deref. This turned out to be due to entity_eligible() returningfalsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow.Specifically, reweight_eevdf() computes the vlag without consideringthe limit placed upon vlag as update_entity_lag() does, and then thescaling multiplication (remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) canoverflow. This then leads to the new vruntime being weird which thencauses the above entity_eligible() to go side-ways and claim nothingis eligible.Thus limit the range of vlag accordingly.All this was quite rare, but fatal when it does happen.",
