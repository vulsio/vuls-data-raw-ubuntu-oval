    "Title": "CVE-2019-10166 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "It was discovered that libvirtd, versions 4.x.x before 4.10.1 and 5.x.x before 5.4.1, would permit readonly clients to use the virDomainManagedSaveDefineXML() API, which would permit them to modify managed save state files. If a managed save had already been created by a privileged user, a local attacker could modify this file such that libvirtd would execute an arbitrary program when the domain was resumed.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10166` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnss-libvirt - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-bin - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-clients - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-sheepdog - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-zfs - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-system - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-sanlock - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-wireshark - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt0 - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nNo subscription required",
