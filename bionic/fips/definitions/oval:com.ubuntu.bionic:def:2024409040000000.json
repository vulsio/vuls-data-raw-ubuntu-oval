Therefore we replace them withdev_err_ratelimited().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40904` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-generic - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-lowlatency - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-aws - 5.4.0-1132.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1137-azure - 5.4.0-1137.144~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1136-gcp - 5.4.0-1136.145~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-ibm - 5.4.0-1079.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1131-oracle - 5.4.0-1131.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
