		"Title": "CVE-2023-43655 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Users publishing a composer.phar to a public web-accessible server where the composer.phar can be executed as a php file may be subject to a remote code execution vulnerability if PHP also has `register_argc_argv` enabled in php.ini. Versions 2.6.4, 2.2.22 and 1.10.27 patch this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled in php.ini, and avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this is not best practice.",
