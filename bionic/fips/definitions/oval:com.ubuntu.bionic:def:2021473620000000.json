		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/pm: Update intermediate power state for SIUpdate the current state as boot state during dpm initialization.During the subsequent initialization, set_power_state gets called totransition to the final power state. set_power_state refers to valuesfrom the current state and without current state populated, it couldresult in NULL pointer dereference.For ex: on platforms where PCI speed change is supported through ACPIATCS method, the link speed of current state needs to be queried beforedeciding on changing to final power state's link speed. The logic to queryATCS-support was broken on certain platforms. The issue became visiblewhen broken ATCS-support logic got fixed with commitf9b7f3703ff9 (\"drm/amdgpu/acpi: make ATPX/ATCS structures global (v2)\").Bug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1698",
