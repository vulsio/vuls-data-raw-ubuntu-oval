Net::IMAP does not raise an exception when StartTLS fails with an an unknown response, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the TLS protections by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to block the StartTLS command, aka a \"StartTLS stripping attack.\"\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32066` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.10\nruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.10\nNo subscription required",
