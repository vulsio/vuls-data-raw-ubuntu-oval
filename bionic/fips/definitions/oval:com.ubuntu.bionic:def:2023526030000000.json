The check tobreak the loop when fsi value becomes -1 is present but syzbot was able toproduce value less than -1 which cause the error. This patch simply add thechange for the values less than 0. The patch is tested via syzbot.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52603` to fix the vulnerability.
