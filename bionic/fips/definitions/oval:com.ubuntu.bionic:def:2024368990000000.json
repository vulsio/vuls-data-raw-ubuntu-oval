		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify Theuse-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file isbeing closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed bybitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chainfailed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO chip'slines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's readrwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free ofwatched_lines. Here is the typical stack when issue happened: [free]gpio_chrdev_release() --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines) <-- freed -->blocking_notifier_chain_unregister() --> down_write(&nh->rwsem) <-- waitingrwsem --> __down_write_common() --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath() -->schedule_preempt_disabled() --> schedule() [use] st54spi_gpio_dev_release()--> gpio_free() --> gpiod_free() --> gpiod_free_commit() -->gpiod_line_state_notify() --> blocking_notifier_call_chain() -->down_read(&nh->rwsem); <-- held rwsem --> notifier_call_chain() -->lineinfo_changed_notify() --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- useafter free The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO lineevent is being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, sincethe chrdev is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read thatevent anyway. To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after theunregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.",
