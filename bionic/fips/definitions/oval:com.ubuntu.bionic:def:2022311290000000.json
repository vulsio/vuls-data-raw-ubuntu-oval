		"description": "moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating,and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use aninefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing inmoment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) hasquadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice anoticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users whopass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to momentconstructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimaltweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade shouldconsider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-31129` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjs-moment - 2.20.1+ds-1ubuntu0.1\nnode-moment - 2.20.1+ds-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
