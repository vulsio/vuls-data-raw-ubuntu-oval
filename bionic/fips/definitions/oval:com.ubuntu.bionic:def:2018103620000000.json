		"description": "An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loosecomparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for theuser-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simplerpassword if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation(like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, inthe loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number inscientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, thecomparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0')to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simplenumber he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents thecast into numbers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10362` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpliteadmin - 1.9.7.1-1ubuntu0.1\nphpliteadmin-themes - 1.9.7.1-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
