		"description": "Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allowchanging specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-boundswriting issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. Thiscould be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data tothose APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecodethan otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.",
