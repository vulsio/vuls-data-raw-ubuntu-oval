    "Title": "CVE-2017-9228 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption. It was discovered that Oniguruma incorrectly handled certain regular expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-9228` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibonig4 - 6.3.0-1\nNo subscription required",
