		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: mpt3sas: Avoid test/set_bit() operating in non-allocated memoryThere is a potential out-of-bounds access when using test_bit() on a singleword. The test_bit() and set_bit() functions operate on long values, andwhen testing or setting a single word, they can exceed the wordboundary. KASAN detects this issue and produces a dump:\t BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in _scsih_add_device.constprop.0(./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:60./include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-atomic.h:29drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_scsih.c:7331) mpt3sas\t Write of size 8 at addr ffff8881d26e3c60 by task kworker/u1536:2/2965For full log, please look at [1].Make the allocation at least the size of sizeof(unsigned long) so thatset_bit() and test_bit() have sufficient room for read/write operationswithout overwriting unallocated memory.[1] Link: https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZkNcALr3W3KGYYJG@gmail.com/",
