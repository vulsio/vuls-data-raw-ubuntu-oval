		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pkt In rxe_comp_queue_pkt() anincoming response packet skb is enqueued to the resp_pkts queue and then adecision is made whether to run the completer task inline or schedule it.Finally the skb is dereferenced to bump a 'hw' performance counter. This iswrong because if the completer task is already running in a separate threadit may have already processed the skb and freed it which can cause a segfault. This has been observed infrequently in testing at high scale. Thispatch fixes this by changing the order of enqueuing the packet until afterthe counter is accessed.",
