So we need to use a raw spinlock for cgr_lock to ensure we aren'twaiting on a sleeping task. Although this bug has existed for a while, itwas not apparent until commit ef2a8d5478b9 (\"net: dpaa: Adjust queue depthon rate change\") which invokes smp_call_function_single viaqman_update_cgr_safe every time a link goes up or down.",
