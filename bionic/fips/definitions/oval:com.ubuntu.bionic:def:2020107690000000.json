    "Title": "CVE-2020-10769 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before 5.0 in crypto_authenc_extractkeys in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. When a payload longer than 4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10769` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-55-generic - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-4.15.0-55-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-4.15.0-55-lowlatency - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-55-generic - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-55-lowlatency - 4.15.0-55.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws - 4.15.0-1047.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1016-aws - 5.3.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1007-azure - 5.3.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-gke - 4.15.0-1037.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1011-gke - 5.0.0-1011.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.0.0-23-generic - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.0.0-23-generic-lpae - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.0.0-23-lowlatency - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-23-generic - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-23-lowlatency - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1039-kvm - 4.15.0-1039.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1050-oem - 4.15.0-1050.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1010-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-oracle - 4.15.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1041-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1041.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1017-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1017.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-55-generic - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-4.15.0-55-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-4.15.0-55-lowlatency - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-55-generic - 4.15.0-55.60\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-55-lowlatency - 4.15.0-55.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws - 4.15.0-1047.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1007-azure - 5.3.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-gke - 4.15.0-1037.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1011-gke - 5.0.0-1011.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.0.0-23-generic - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.0.0-23-generic-lpae - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.0.0-23-lowlatency - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-23-generic - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-23-lowlatency - 5.0.0-23.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1050-oem - 4.15.0-1050.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1010-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-oracle - 4.15.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1058-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1058.64\nNo subscription required",
