		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/dasd: fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev due to missing pavgroup FixOops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev() function caused by the pavgroup pointerbeing NULL. The pavgroup pointer is checked on the entrance of the functionbut without the lcu->lock being held. Therefore there is a race windowbetween dasd_alias_get_start_dev() and _lcu_update() which sets pavgroup toNULL with the lcu->lock held. Fix by checking the pavgroup pointer withlcu->lock held.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48636` to fix the vulnerability.
