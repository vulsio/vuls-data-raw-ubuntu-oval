		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is addedCommit 09ed8bfc5215 (\"wilc1000: Rename workqueue from \"WILC_wq\" to\"NETDEV-wq\"\") moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order toset the interface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driverneeds only one workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time weadd an interface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with anew one. This can be observed with the following commands:for i in $(seq 0 10)do  iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed  iw dev wlan1 deldoneps -eo pid,comm|grep wlan 39 kworker/R-wlan0 98 kworker/R-wlan1102 kworker/R-wlan1105 kworker/R-wlan1108 kworker/R-wlan1111 kworker/R-wlan1114 kworker/R-wlan1117 kworker/R-wlan1120 kworker/R-wlan1123 kworker/R-wlan1126 kworker/R-wlan1129 kworker/R-wlan1Fix this leakage by putting back hif_workqueue allocation inwilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding the workqueue name, it is indeed relevant toset it lowercase, however it is not  attached to a specific netdev, soenforcing netdev name in the name is not so relevant. Still, enrich thename with the wiphy name to make it clear which phy is using the workqueue.",
