		"description": "HAProxy before 2.7.3 may allow a bypass of access control because HTTP/1headers are inadvertently lost in some situations, aka \"request smuggling.\"The HTTP header parsers in HAProxy may accept empty header field names,which could be used to truncate the list of HTTP headers and thus make someheaders disappear after being parsed and processed for HTTP/1.0 andHTTP/1.1. For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the impact is limited because the headersdisappear before being parsed and processed, as if they had not been sentby the client. The fixed versions are 2.7.3, 2.6.9, 2.5.12, 2.4.22, 2.2.29,and 2.0.31.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-25725` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhaproxy - 1.8.8-1ubuntu0.13\nvim-haproxy - 1.8.8-1ubuntu0.13\nNo subscription required",
