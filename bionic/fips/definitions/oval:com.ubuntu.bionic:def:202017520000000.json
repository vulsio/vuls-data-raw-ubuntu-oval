		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory pathscontaining an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected bythis issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating aspecially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, wouldpotentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version2.32.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-1752` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nglibc-source - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc-bin - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc6 - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc6-amd64 - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc6-armel - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc6-i386 - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc6-pic - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc6-s390 - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlibc6-x32 - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlocales - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nlocales-all - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nmultiarch-support - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nnscd - 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
