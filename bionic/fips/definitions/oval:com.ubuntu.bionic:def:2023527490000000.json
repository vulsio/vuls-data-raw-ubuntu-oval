		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:Fix null dereference on suspend A race condition exists where a synchronous(noqueue) transfer can be active during a system suspend. This can cause anull pointer dereference exception to occur when the system resumes.Example order of events leading to the exception: 1. spi_sync() calls__spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets ctlr->cur_msg 2. Spi transferbegins via spi_transfer_one_message() 3. System is suspended interruptingthe transfer context 4. System is resumed 6. spi_controller_resume() callsspi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg to NULL 7. Spi transfer contextresumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is called which dereferencescur_msg (which is now NULL) Wait for synchronous transfers to completebefore suspending by acquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspendflag.",
