		"Description": "Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permittedaccess to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pagesremain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Granttable v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches(back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisorenforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping ofsuch a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests toretain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for otherpurposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similarissue was not noticed.",
