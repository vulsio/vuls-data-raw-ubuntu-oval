		"Title": "CVE-2021-21334 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRIimplementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/containerclient that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image mayreceive incorrect environment variables, including values that are definedfor other containers. If the affected containers have different securitycontexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionallyshared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through oneof the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue.If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from thesame image which have different environment variables, you are notvulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers orKubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reducedlikelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has beenfixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update tothese versions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21334` to fix the vulnerability.
