		"description": "Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Uploadof File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from UntrustedControl Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr:from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1. In the affectedversions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploadedthrough the ConfigSets API. When backing up Solr Collections, theseconfigSet files would be saved to disk when using theLocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups). If the backup wassaved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then thejar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet, trustedor untrusted. When Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), asis strongly suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending theBackup permissions with the ability to add libraries. Users are recommendedto upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue. In theseversions, the following protections have been added: * Users are no longerable to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a JavaClassLoader. * The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories thatare used in the ClassLoader.",
