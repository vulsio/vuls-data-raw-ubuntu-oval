		"description": "An issue was discovered in aspeed_lpc_ctrl_mmap indrivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.6.Local attackers able to access the Aspeed LPC control interface couldoverwrite memory in the kernel and potentially execute privileges, akaCID-b49a0e69a7b1. This occurs because a certain comparison uses values thatare not memory sizes.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-42252` to fix the vulnerability.
