		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/mediatek: Init `ddp_comp` with devm_kcalloc()In the case where `conn_routes` is true we allocate an extra slot inthe `ddp_comp` array but mtk_drm_crtc_create() never seemed toinitialize it in the test case I ran. For me, this caused a latercrash when we looped through the array in mtk_drm_crtc_mode_valid().This showed up for me when I booted with `slub_debug=FZPUA` whichpoisons the memory initially. Without `slub_debug` I couldn'treproduce, presumably because the later code handles the value beingNULL and in most cases (not guaranteed in all cases) the memory theallocator returned started out as 0.It really doesn't hurt to initialize the array with devm_kcalloc()since the array is small and the overhead of initting a handful ofelements to 0 is small. In general initting memory to zero is a saferpractice and usually it's suggested to only use the non-initting allocfunctions if you really need to.Let's switch the function to use an allocation function that zeros thememory. For me, this avoids the crash.",
