		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/mediatek: Init `ddp_comp` with devm_kcalloc() In the case where`conn_routes` is true we allocate an extra slot in the `ddp_comp` array butmtk_drm_crtc_create() never seemed to initialize it in the test case I ran.For me, this caused a later crash when we looped through the array inmtk_drm_crtc_mode_valid(). This showed up for me when I booted with`slub_debug=FZPUA` which poisons the memory initially. Without `slub_debug`I couldn't reproduce, presumably because the later code handles the valuebeing NULL and in most cases (not guaranteed in all cases) the memory theallocator returned started out as 0. It really doesn't hurt to initializethe array with devm_kcalloc() since the array is small and the overhead ofinitting a handful of elements to 0 is small. In general initting memory tozero is a safer practice and usually it's suggested to only use thenon-initting alloc functions if you really need to. Let's switch thefunction to use an allocation function that zeros the memory. For me, thisavoids the crash.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38592` to fix the vulnerability.
