		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 HVM/PVH guest OSusers to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) because VMX VMEntrychecks mishandle a certain case. Please see XSA-260 for background on theMovSS shadow. Please see XSA-156 for background on the need for #DBinterception. The VMX VMEntry checks do not like the exact combination ofstate which occurs when #DB in intercepted, Single Stepping is active, andblocked by STI/MovSS is active, despite this being a legitimate state to bein. The resulting VMEntry failure is fatal to the guest. HVM/PVH guestuserspace code may be able to crash the guest, resulting in a guest Denialof Service. All versions of Xen are affected. Only systems supporting VMXhardware virtual extensions (Intel, Cyrix, or Zhaoxin CPUs) are affected.Arm and AMD systems are unaffected. Only HVM/PVH guests are affected. PVguests cannot leverage the vulnerability.",
