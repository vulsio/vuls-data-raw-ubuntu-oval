		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mtd: Fix gluebi NULL pointer dereference caused by ftl notifierIf both ftl.ko and gluebi.ko are loaded, the notifier of ftltriggers NULL pointer dereference when trying to access‘gluebi->desc’ in gluebi_read().ubi_gluebi_init  ubi_register_volume_notifier    ubi_enumerate_volumes      ubi_notify_all        gluebi_notify    nb->notifier_call()          gluebi_create            mtd_device_register              mtd_device_parse_register                add_mtd_device                  blktrans_notify_add   not->add()                    ftl_add_mtd         tr->add_mtd()                      scan_header                        mtd_read                          mtd_read_oob                            mtd_read_oob_std                              gluebi_read   mtd->read()                                gluebi->desc - NULLDetailed reproduction information available at the Link [1],In the normal case, obtain gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(),and access gluebi->desc in the gluebi_read(). However,gluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in theftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBIvolume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi fromcreating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of thetype MTD_UBIVOLUME.",
