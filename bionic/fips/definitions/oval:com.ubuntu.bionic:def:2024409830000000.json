		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tipc: force a dst refcount before doing decryptionAs it says in commit 3bc07321ccc2 (\"xfrm: Force a dst refcount beforeentering the xfrm type handlers\"):\"Crypto requests might return asynchronous. In this case we leave the rcu protected region, so force a refcount on the skb's destination entry before we enter the xfrm type input/output handlers.\"On TIPC decryption path it has the same problem, and skb_dst_force()should be called before doing decryption to avoid a possible crash.Shuang reported this issue when this warning is triggered:  [] WARNING: include/net/dst.h:337 tipc_sk_rcv+0x1055/0x1ea0 [tipc]  [] Kdump: loaded Tainted: G W --------- - - 4.18.0-496.el8.x86_64+debug  [] Workqueue: crypto cryptd_queue_worker  [] RIP: 0010:tipc_sk_rcv+0x1055/0x1ea0 [tipc]  [] Call Trace:  [] tipc_sk_mcast_rcv+0x548/0xea0 [tipc]  [] tipc_rcv+0xcf5/0x1060 [tipc]  [] tipc_aead_decrypt_done+0x215/0x2e0 [tipc]  [] cryptd_aead_crypt+0xdb/0x190  [] cryptd_queue_worker+0xed/0x190  [] process_one_work+0x93d/0x17e0\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40983` to fix the vulnerability.
