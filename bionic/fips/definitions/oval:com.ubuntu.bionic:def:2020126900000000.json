		"Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0.The list of roles provided for an OAuth1 access token is silently ignored.Thus, when an access token is used to request a keystone token, thekeystone token contains every role assignment the creator had for theproject. This results in the provided keystone token having more roleassignments than the creator intended, possibly giving unintended escalatedaccess.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-12690` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nkeystone - 2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1\npython-keystone - 2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
