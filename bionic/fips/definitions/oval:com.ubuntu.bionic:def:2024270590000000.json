		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command The isd200sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values in the ATA IDinformation to calculate cylinder and head values when creating a CDB forREAD or WRITE commands. The calculation involves division and modulusoperations, which will cause a crash if either of these values is 0. Whilethis never happens with a genuine device, it could happen with a flawed orsubversive emulation, as reported by the syzbot fuzzer. Protect againstthis possibility by refusing to bind to the device if either theATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID information is 0.This requires isd200_Initialization() to return a negative error code wheninitialization fails; currently it always returns 0 (even when there is anerror).",
