The problem was in non-freed perfecthash in tcindex_partial_destroy_work(). In tcindex_set_parms() newtcindex_data is allocated and some fields from old one are copied to newone, but not the perfect hash. Since tcindex_partial_destroy_work() is thedestroy function for old tcindex_data, we need to free perfect hash toavoid memory leak.",
