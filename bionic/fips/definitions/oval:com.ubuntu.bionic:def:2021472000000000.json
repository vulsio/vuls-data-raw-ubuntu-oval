		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/prime: Fix use after free in mmap with drm_gem_ttm_mmapdrm_gem_ttm_mmap() drops a reference to the gem object on success. If thegem object's refcount == 1 on entry to drm_gem_prime_mmap(), that drop willfree the gem object, and the subsequent drm_gem_object_get() will be a UAF.Fix by grabbing a reference before calling the mmap helper. This issue wasforseen when the reference dropping was adding in commit 9786b65bc61ac(\"drm/ttm: fix mmap refcounting\"): \"For that to work properly thedrm_gem_object_get() call in drm_gem_ttm_mmap() must be moved so it happensbefore calling obj->funcs->mmap(), otherwise the gem refcount would go downto zero.\"",
