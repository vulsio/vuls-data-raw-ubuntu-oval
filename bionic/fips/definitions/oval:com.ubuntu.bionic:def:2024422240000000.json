		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Correct check for empty listSince commit a3c53be55c95 (\"net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Support multiple MDIObusses\") mv88e6xxx_default_mdio_bus() has checked that thereturn value of list_first_entry() is non-NULL.This appears to be intended to guard against the list chip->mdios beingempty.  However, it is not the correct check as the implementation oflist_first_entry is not designed to return NULL for empty lists.Instead, use list_first_entry_or_null() which does return NULL if thelist is empty.Flagged by Smatch.Compile tested only.",
