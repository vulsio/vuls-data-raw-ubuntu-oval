		"description": "In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing thatallowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to apossibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind areverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding headerin a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.",
