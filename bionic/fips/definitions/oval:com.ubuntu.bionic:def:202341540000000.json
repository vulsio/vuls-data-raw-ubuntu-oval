		"description": "A design flaw was found in Samba's DirSync control implementation, whichexposes passwords and secrets in Active Directory to privileged users andRead-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs). This flaw allows RODCs and userspossessing the GET_CHANGES right to access all attributes, includingsensitive secrets and passwords. Even in a default setup, RODC DC accounts,which should only replicate some passwords, can gain access to all domainsecrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively eliminating the RODC / DCdistinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability fails to account for errorconditions (fail open), like out-of-memory situations, potentially grantingaccess to secret attributes, even under low-privileged attacker influence.",
