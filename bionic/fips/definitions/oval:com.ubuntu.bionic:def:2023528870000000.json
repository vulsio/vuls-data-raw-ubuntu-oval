		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: can: j1939: enhanced error handling for tightly received RTS messagesin xtp_rx_rts_session_newThis patch enhances error handling in scenarios with RTS (Request toSend) messages arriving closely. It replaces the less informativeWARN_ON_ONCEbacktraces with a new error handling method. This provides clearer errormessages and allows for the early termination of problematic sessions.Previously, sessions were only released at the end of j1939_xtp_rx_rts().Potentially this could be reproduced with something like:testj1939 -r vcan0:0x80 &while true; do\t# send first RTS\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;\t# send second RTS\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;\t# send abort\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#ff00000000002301;done\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52887` to fix the vulnerability.
