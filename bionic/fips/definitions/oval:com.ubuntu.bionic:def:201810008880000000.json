		"Description": "PEAR Archive_Tar version 1.4.3 and earlier contains a CWE-502, CWE-915vulnerability in the Archive_Tar class. There are several file operationswith `$v_header['filename']` as parameter (such as file_exists, is_file,is_dir, etc). When extract is called without a specific prefix path, we cantrigger unserialization by crafting a tar file with`phar://[path_to_malicious_phar_file]` as path. Object injection can beused to trigger destruct in the loaded PHP classes, e.g. the Archive_Tarclass itself. With Archive_Tar object injection, arbitrary file deletioncan occur because `@unlink($this->_temp_tarname)` is called. If anotherclass with useful gadget is loaded, it may possible to cause remote codeexecution that can result in files being deleted or possibly modified. Thisvulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.4.4.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1000888` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphp-pear - 1:1.10.5+submodules+notgz-1ubuntu1.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
