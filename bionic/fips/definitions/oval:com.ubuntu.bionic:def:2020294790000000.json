		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. In the Ocaml xenstoredimplementation, the internal representation of the tree has special casesfor the root node, because this node has no parent. Unfortunately,permissions were not checked for certain operations on the root node.Unprivileged guests can get and modify permissions, list, and delete theroot node. (Deleting the whole xenstore tree is a host-wide denial ofservice.) Achieving xenstore write access is also possible. All systemsusing oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is thedefault in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler isavailable. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.",
