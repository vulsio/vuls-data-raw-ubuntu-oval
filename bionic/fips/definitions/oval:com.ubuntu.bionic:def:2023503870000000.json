		"title": "CVE-2023-50387 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840,and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPUconsumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the \"KeyTrap\" issue. Oneof the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIGrecords, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluateall combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.",
