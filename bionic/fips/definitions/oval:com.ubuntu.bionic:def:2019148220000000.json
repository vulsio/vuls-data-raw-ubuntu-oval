		"Title": "CVE-2019-14822 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was discovered in ibus in versions before 1.5.22 that allows any unprivileged user to monitor and send method calls to the ibus bus of another user due to a misconfiguration in the DBus server setup. A local attacker may use this flaw to intercept all keystrokes of a victim user who is using the graphical interface, change the input method engine, or modify other input related configurations of the victim user. Simon McVittie discovered that ibus did not enforce appropriate access controls on its private D-Bus socket. A local unprivileged user who discovers the ibus socket address of another user could exploit this to capture the key strokes of the other user.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-14822` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-ibus-1.0 - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3\nibus - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3\nibus-gtk - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3\nibus-gtk3 - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3\nibus-wayland - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3\nlibibus-1.0-5 - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3\nNo subscription required",
