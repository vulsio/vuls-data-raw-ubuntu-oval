		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ixgbe:fix unbalanced device enable/disable in suspend/resume pci_disable_device()called in __ixgbe_shutdown() decreases dev->enable_cnt by 1.pci_enable_device_mem() which increases dev->enable_cnt by 1, was removedfrom ixgbe_resume() in commit 6f82b2558735 (\"ixgbe: use generic powermanagement\"). This caused unbalanced increase/decrease. So addpci_enable_device_mem() back. Fix the following call trace. ixgbe0000:17:00.1: disabling already-disabled device Call Trace:__ixgbe_shutdown+0x10a/0x1e0 [ixgbe] ixgbe_suspend+0x32/0x70 [ixgbe]pci_pm_suspend+0x87/0x160 ? pci_pm_freeze+0xd0/0xd0dpm_run_callback+0x42/0x170 __device_suspend+0x114/0x460async_suspend+0x1f/0xa0 async_run_entry_fn+0x3c/0xf0process_one_work+0x1dd/0x410 worker_thread+0x34/0x3f0 ?cancel_delayed_work+0x90/0x90 kthread+0x14c/0x170 ? kthread_park+0x90/0x90ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30",
