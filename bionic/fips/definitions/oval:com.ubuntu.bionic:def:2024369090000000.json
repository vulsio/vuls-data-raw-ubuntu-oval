		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Drivers: hv: vmbus: Don't free ring buffers that couldn't be re-encryptedIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to causeset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an erroris returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take careto handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to thepage allocator, which could lead to functional or security issues. TheVMBus ring buffer code could free decrypted/shared pages ifset_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the structvmbus_gpadl for the ring buffers to decide whether to free the memory.",
