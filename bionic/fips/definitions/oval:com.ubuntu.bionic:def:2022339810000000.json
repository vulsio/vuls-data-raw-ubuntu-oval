    "Title": "CVE-2022-33981 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function. Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33981` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-dell300x - 4.15.0-1051.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1125-kvm - 4.15.0-1125.130\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1066-raspi - 5.4.0-1066.76~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1117-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1117.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-dell300x - 4.15.0-1051.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1135.145\nNo subscription required",
