		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net:emac/emac-mac: Fix a use after free in emac_mac_tx_buf_send Inemac_mac_tx_buf_send, it calls emac_tx_fill_tpd(..,skb,..). If some errorhappens in emac_tx_fill_tpd(), the skb will be freed via dev_kfree_skb(skb)in error branch of emac_tx_fill_tpd(). But the freed skb is still used viaskb->len by netdev_sent_queue(,skb->len). As i observed thatemac_tx_fill_tpd() haven't modified the value of skb->len, thus my patchassigns skb->len to 'len' before the possible free and use 'len' instead ofskb->len later.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47013` to fix the vulnerability.
