		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_set Off-by-one errors happenbecause nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo are incorrectly added one. The index ofthe loop is equal to the number of PDOs to be updated when leaving the loopand it doesn't need to be added one. When doing the power negotiation, TCPMrelies on the \"nr_snk_pdo\" as the size of the local sink PDO array to matchthe Source capabilities of the partner port. If the off-by-one overflowoccurs, a wrong RDO might be sent and unexpected power transfer mighthappen such as over voltage or over current (than expected). \"nr_src_pdo\"is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Source role. It is also thearray size of the local Source capabilities when filling up the bufferwhich will be sent as the Source PDOs (such as in Power Negotiation). Ifthe off-by-one overflow occurs, a wrong Rp level might be set and wrongSource PDOs will be sent to the partner port. This could potentially causeover current or port resets.",
