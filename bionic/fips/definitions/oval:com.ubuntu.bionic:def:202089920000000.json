    "Title": "CVE-2020-8992 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "ext4_protect_reserved_inode in fs/ext4/block_validity.c in the Linux kernel through 5.5.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) via a crafted journal size. Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (soft lockup).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-8992` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1065-aws - 4.15.0-1065.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1017-aws - 5.3.0-1017.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-azure - 5.3.0-1020.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gcp - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-gke - 4.15.0-1057.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1035-gke - 5.0.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gke - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1058-kvm - 4.15.0-1058.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1079-oem - 4.15.0-1079.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-oracle - 4.15.0-1037.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1016-oracle - 5.3.0-1016.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1060-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1060.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1023-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1023.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1065-aws - 4.15.0-1065.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-azure - 5.3.0-1020.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gcp - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-gke - 4.15.0-1057.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1035-gke - 5.0.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gke - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1079-oem - 4.15.0-1079.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-oracle - 4.15.0-1037.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1016-oracle - 5.3.0-1016.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1076-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1076.83\nNo subscription required",
