		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: seg6:fix the iif in the IPv6 socket control block When an IPv4 packet isreceived, the ip_rcv_core(...) sets the receiving interface index into theIPv4 socket control block (v5.16-rc4, net/ipv4/ip_input.c line 510):IPCB(skb)->iif = skb->skb_iif; If that IPv4 packet is meant to beencapsulated in an outer IPv6+SRH header, the seg6_do_srh_encap(...)performs the required encapsulation. In this case, the seg6_do_srh_encapfunction clears the IPv6 socket control block (v5.16-rc4net/ipv6/seg6_iptunnel.c line 163): memset(IP6CB(skb), 0,sizeof(*IP6CB(skb))); The memset(...) was introduced in commit ef489749aae5(\"ipv6: sr: clear IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation\") a long time ago(2019-01-29). Since the IPv6 socket control block and the IPv4 socketcontrol block share the same memory area (skb->cb), the receiving interfaceindex info is lost (IP6CB(skb)->iif is set to zero). As a side effect, thatcondition triggers a NULL pointer dereference if commit 0857d6f8c759(\"ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig netdev\") is applied. Tofix that issue, we set the IP6CB(skb)->iif with the index of the receivinginterface once again.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47515` to fix the vulnerability.
