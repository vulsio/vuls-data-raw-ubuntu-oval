		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst refcnt when egressing The egress tunnel codeuses dst_clone() and directly sets the result which is wrong because theentry might have 0 refcnt or be already deleted, causing number ofproblems. It also triggers the WARN_ON() in dst_hold()[1] when a refcntcouldn't be taken. Fix it by using dst_hold_safe() and checking if areference was actually taken before setting the dst.
