Thisargument is plausibly an untrusted value from an application's input datathat was supposed to contain a name and an e-mail address. NOTE:email.utils.parseaddr is categorized as a Legacy API in the documentationof the Python email package. Applications should instead use theemail.parser.BytesParser or email.parser.Parser class. NOTE: the vendor'sperspective is that this is neither a vulnerability nor a bug. The emailpackage is intended to have size limits and to throw an exception whenlimits are exceeded; they were exceeded by the example demonstration code.",
