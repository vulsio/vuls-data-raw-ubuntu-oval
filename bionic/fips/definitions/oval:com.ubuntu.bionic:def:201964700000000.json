		"title": "CVE-2019-6470 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "There had existed in one of the ISC BIND libraries a bug in a function thatwas used by dhcpd when operating in DHCPv6 mode. There was also a bug indhcpd relating to the use of this function per its documentation, but thebug in the library function prevented this from causing any harm. Allreleases of dhcpd from ISC contain copies of this, and other, BINDlibraries in combinations that have been tested prior to release and areknown to not present issues like this. Some third-party packagers of ISCsoftware have modified the dhcpd source, BIND source, or version matchup inways that create the crash potential. Based on reports available to ISC,the crash probability is large and no analysis has been done on how, oreven if, the probability can be manipulated by an attacker. Affects: Buildsof dhcpd versions prior to version 4.4.1 when using BIND versions 9.11.2 orlater, or BIND versions with specific bug fixes backported to them. ISCdoes not have access to comprehensive version lists for all repackagings ofdhcpd that are vulnerable. In particular, builds from other vendors mayalso be affected. Operators are advised to consult their vendordocumentation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-6470` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nisc-dhcp-client - 4.3.5-3ubuntu7.1\nisc-dhcp-client-ddns - 4.3.5-3ubuntu7.1\nisc-dhcp-common - 4.3.5-3ubuntu7.1\nisc-dhcp-relay - 4.3.5-3ubuntu7.1\nisc-dhcp-server - 4.3.5-3ubuntu7.1\nisc-dhcp-server-ldap - 4.3.5-3ubuntu7.1\nNo subscription required",
