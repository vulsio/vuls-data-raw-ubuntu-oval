    "Title": "CVE-2021-38198 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly compute the access permissions for shadow pages in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-38198` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-161-generic - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-4.15.0-161-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-4.15.0-161-lowlatency - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-161-generic - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-161-lowlatency - 4.15.0-161.169\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1114-aws - 4.15.0-1114.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1058-aws - 5.4.0-1058.61~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1125-azure - 4.15.0-1125.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-azure - 5.4.0-1062.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1029-dell300x - 4.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1110-gcp - 4.15.0-1110.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gcp - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-gke - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gkeop - 5.4.0-1025.26~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1101-kvm - 4.15.0-1101.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-oracle - 4.15.0-1082.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-oracle - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1045-raspi - 5.4.0-1045.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1097.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-161-generic - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-4.15.0-161-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-4.15.0-161-lowlatency - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-161-generic - 4.15.0-161.169\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-161-lowlatency - 4.15.0-161.169\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1114-aws - 4.15.0-1114.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1058-aws - 5.4.0-1058.61~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1125-azure - 4.15.0-1125.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-azure - 5.4.0-1062.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1029-dell300x - 4.15.0-1029.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1110-gcp - 4.15.0-1110.124\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gcp - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-gke - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gkeop - 5.4.0-1025.26~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-oracle - 4.15.0-1082.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-oracle - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1114-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1114.123\nNo subscription required",
