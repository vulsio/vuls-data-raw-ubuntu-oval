		"description": "A flaw has been found in libssh in versions prior to 0.9.6. The SSHprotocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of thesession. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id.Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previoussession_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically,both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long asthese buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also changethe key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size,eventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_idhas. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when itis used again during second key re-exchange.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3634` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssh-4 - 0.8.0~20170825.94fa1e38-1ubuntu0.7\nlibssh-gcrypt-4 - 0.8.0~20170825.94fa1e38-1ubuntu0.7\nNo subscription required",
