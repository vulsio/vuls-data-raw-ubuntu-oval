		"title": "CVE-2024-26687 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanup shutdown_pirq andstartup_pirq are not taking the irq_mapping_update_lock because they can'tdue to lock inversion. Both are called with the irq_desc->lock beingtaking. The lock order, however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and thenirq_desc->lock. This opens multiple races: - shutdown_pirq can beinterrupted by a function that allocates an event channel: CPU0 CPU1shutdown_pirq { xen_evtchn_close(e) __startup_pirq { EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq ->returns just freed evtchn e set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq) }xen_irq_info_cleanup() { set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1) } } Assume here eventchannel e refers here to the same event channel number. After this race theevtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1). - __startup_pirq races with__unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because __startup_pirq doesn't takeirq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the evtchn that __unbind_from_irq iscurrently freeing and cleaning up. In this case even though the eventchannel is allocated, its mapping can be unset in evtchn_to_irq. The fix isto first cleanup the mappings and then close the event channel. In thisway, when an event channel gets allocated it's potential previousevtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already. This is also thereverse order of the allocation where first the event channel is allocatedand then the mappings are setup. On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit3fcdaf3d7634 (\"xen/events: modify internal [un]bind interfaces\"), we hit aBUG like the following during probing of NVMe devices. The issue is thatduring nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq is called for every device whichresults in a call to shutdown_pirq. With many nvme devices it's thereforelikely to hit this race during boot because there will be multiple calls toshutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.------------[ cut here ]------------ blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush:disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bouncebuffer: enabled kernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499! invalidopcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI CPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Nottainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1 Hardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS4.11.amazon 08/24/2006 Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work RIP:0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0 Code: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e82b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f85 60 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f44 00 00 RSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046 RAX: 0000000000000000RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006 RDX: 0000000000000028 RSI:00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff RBP: ffff888107419680 R08:0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00 R10: 0000000000000000 R11:0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed R13: 0000000000000000 R14:00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002 FS: 0000000000000000(0000)GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS: 0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4:00000000001706e0 DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2:0000000000000000 DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7:0000000000000400 Call Trace: ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9 ?show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9 ? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0 ?__die_body.cold+0x8/0xd ? die+0x2b/0x50 ? do_trap+0x90/0x110 ?bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0 ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80 ?bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0 ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70 ?bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20 ?bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x ---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26687` to fix the vulnerability.
