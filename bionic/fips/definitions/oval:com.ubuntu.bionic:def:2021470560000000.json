		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:qat - ADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING should be set after adf_dev_initADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING is (only) used and checked by adf_vf2pf_shutdown()before calling adf_iov_putmsg()->mutex_lock(vf2pf_lock), however thevf2pf_lock is initialized in adf_dev_init(), which can fail and when itfail, the vf2pf_lock is either not initialized or destroyed, a subsequentuse of vf2pf_lock will cause issue. To fix this issue, only set this flagif adf_dev_init() returns 0.
