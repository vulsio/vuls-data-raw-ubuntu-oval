		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/arm-smmu: Fix arm_smmu_device refcount leak when arm_smmu_rpm_getfailsarm_smmu_rpm_get() invokes pm_runtime_get_sync(), which increases therefcount of the \"smmu\" even though the return value is less than 0.The reference counting issue happens in some error handling paths ofarm_smmu_rpm_get() in its caller functions. When arm_smmu_rpm_get()fails, the caller functions forget to decrease the refcount of \"smmu\"increased by arm_smmu_rpm_get(), causing a refcount leak.Fix this issue by calling pm_runtime_resume_and_get() instead ofpm_runtime_get_sync() in arm_smmu_rpm_get(), which can keep the refcountbalanced in case of failure.",
