		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined In iocg_pay_debt(),warn is triggered if 'active_list' is empty, which is intended to confirmiocg is active when it has debt. However, warn can be triggered during ablkcg or disk removal, if iocg_waitq_timer_fn() is run at that time:WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2344971 at block/blk-iocost.c:1402iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190 Call trace: iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190iocg_kick_waitq+0x438/0x4c0 iocg_waitq_timer_fn+0xd8/0x130__run_hrtimer+0x144/0x45c __hrtimer_run_queues+0x16c/0x244hrtimer_interrupt+0x2cc/0x7b0 The warn in this situation is meaningless.Since this iocg is being removed, the state of the 'active_list' isirrelevant, and 'waitq_timer' is canceled after removing 'active_list' inioc_pd_free(), which ensures iocg is freed after iocg_waitq_timer_fn()returns. Therefore, add the check if iocg was already offlined to avoidwarn when removing a blkcg or disk.",
