		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sfc:adjust efx->xdp_tx_queue_count with the real number of initialized queuesefx->xdp_tx_queue_count is initially initialized to num_possible_cpus() andis later used to allocate and traverse efx->xdp_tx_queues lookup array.However, we may end up not initializing all the array slots with realqueues during probing.
