		"Title": "CVE-2019-6111 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - low",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation beingderived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sentto the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation ofthe object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented).A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwritearbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation(-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (forexample, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-6111` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-client-hmac - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-server - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-server-hmac - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-tests - 1:7.9p1-6\nssh - 1:7.9p1-6\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:7.9p1-6\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
