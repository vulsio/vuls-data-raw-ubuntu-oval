		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove Incommit ac5047671758 (\"hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the VMBuschannel\"), napi_disable was getting called for all channels, including allsubchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not. This causedhv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe() has finishedrunning but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet. netvsc_subchan_work()-> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the sub-channels and because ofthat netvsc_sc_open() is not running. netvsc_remove() callscancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which netvsc_subchan_work didnot run. netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensuresNAPI cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clearthe NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does theopposite. Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is calledfor those subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep. This fixaddresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not gettingcalled for non-enabled NAPI struct. But netif_napi_del() is still necessaryfor these non-enabled NAPI struct for cleanup purpose.
