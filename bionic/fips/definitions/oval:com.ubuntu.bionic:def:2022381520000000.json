		"description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 clientconnects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session, theserver crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the secondsession, which is created through TLS session resumption and reuses theinitial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous session structure(struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL* ssl) on it, the nextreceived Client Hello (that resumes the previous session) crashes theserver. Note that this bug is only triggered when resuming sessions usingTLS session resumption. Only servers that use wolfSSL_clear instead of therecommended SSL_free; SSL_new sequence are affected. Furthermore,wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's compatibility layer and is not enabledby default. It is not part of wolfSSL's native API.",
