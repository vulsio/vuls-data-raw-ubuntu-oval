		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: ni_usb6501: fix NULL-deref in command pathsThe driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but had no sanitychecks on the sizes. This can lead to zero-size-pointer dereferences oroverflowed transfer buffers in ni6501_port_command() andni6501_counter_command() if a (malicious) device has smaller max-packetsizes than expected (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).Add the missing sanity checks to probe().",
