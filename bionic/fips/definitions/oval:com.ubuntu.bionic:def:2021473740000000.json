		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma-debug: prevent an error message from causing runtime problemsFor some drivers, that use the DMA API. This error message can be reachedseveral millions of times per second, causing spam to the kernel's printkbuffer and bringing the CPU usage up to 100% (so, it should be ratelimited). However, since there is at least one driver that is in themainline and suffers from the error condition, it is more useful toerr_printk() here instead of just rate limiting the error message (in hopesthat it will make it easier for other drivers that suffer from this issueto be spotted).",
