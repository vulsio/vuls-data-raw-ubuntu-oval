We also seem to clearthe lower 16 bits of it with bitmap_zero() for no particular reason (myguess would be that 'bitmap' and 'vcpu_bitmap' variables inkvm_bitmap_or_dest_vcpus() caused the confusion: while the later is indeed16-bit long, the later should accommodate all possible vCPUs).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47390` to fix the vulnerability.
