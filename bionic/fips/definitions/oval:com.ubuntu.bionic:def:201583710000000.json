		"description": "Composer before 2016-02-10 allows cache poisoning from other projects builton the same host. This results in attacker-controlled code entering aserver-side build process. The issue occurs because of the way that distpackages are cached. The cache key is derived from the package name, thedist type, and certain other data from the package repository (which maysimply be a commit hash, and thus can be found by an attacker). Versionsthrough 1.0.0-alpha11 are affected, and 1.0.0 is unaffected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-8371` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncomposer - 1.0.0~beta2-1\nNo subscription required",
