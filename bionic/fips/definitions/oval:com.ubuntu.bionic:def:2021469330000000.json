		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:gadget: f_fs: Clear ffs_eventfd in ffs_data_clear. ffs_data_clear isindirectly called from both ffs_fs_kill_sb and ffs_ep0_release, so it endsup being called twice when userland closes ep0 and then unmounts f_fs. Ifuserland provided an eventfd along with function's USB descriptors, it endsup calling eventfd_ctx_put as many times, causing a refcount underflow.NULL-ify ffs_eventfd to prevent these extraneous eventfd_ctx_put calls.Also, set epfiles to NULL right after de-allocating it, for readability.For completeness, ffs_data_clear actually ends up being called thrice, thelast call being before the whole ffs structure gets freed, so when thisspecific sequence happens there is a second underflow happening (but notbeing reported): /sys/kernel/debug/tracing# modprobe usb_f_fs/sys/kernel/debug/tracing# echo ffs_data_clear > set_ftrace_filter/sys/kernel/debug/tracing# echo function > current_tracer/sys/kernel/debug/tracing# echo 1 > tracing_on (setup gadget, run and killfunction userland process, teardown gadget) /sys/kernel/debug/tracing# echo0 > tracing_on /sys/kernel/debug/tracing# cat trace smartcard-openp-436[000] ..... 1946.208786: ffs_data_clear <-ffs_data_closedsmartcard-openp-431 [000] ..... 1946.279147: ffs_data_clear<-ffs_data_closed smartcard-openp-431 [000] .n... 1946.905512:ffs_data_clear <-ffs_data_put Warning output corresponding to above trace:[ 1946.284139] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 431 at lib/refcount.c:28refcount_warn_saturate+0x110/0x15c [ 1946.293094] refcount_t: underflow;use-after-free.
