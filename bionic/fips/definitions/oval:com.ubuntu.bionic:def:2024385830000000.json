		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread Patch series \"nilfs2: fixlog writer related issues\". This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 logwriter-related issues, including a timer use-after-free issue and potentialdeadlock issue on unmount, and a potential freeze issue in eventsynchronization found during their analysis. Details are described in eachcommit log. This patch (of 3): A use-after-free issue has been reportedregarding the timer sc_timer on the nilfs_sc_info structure. The problem isthat even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log writer thread,sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure is about to befreed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime. Fix this issue bylimiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer thread is alive.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38583` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-229-generic - 4.15.0-229.241\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-229-generic - 4.15.0-229.241\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-229-lowlatency - 4.15.0-229.241\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-192-generic - 5.4.0-192.212~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-192-lowlatency - 5.4.0-192.212~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1156-kvm - 4.15.0-1156.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1173-aws - 4.15.0-1173.186\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1130-aws - 5.4.0-1130.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1181-azure - 4.15.0-1181.196\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1135-azure - 5.4.0-1135.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1166-gcp - 4.15.0-1166.183\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1134-gcp - 5.4.0-1134.143~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1077-ibm - 5.4.0-1077.82~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1135-oracle - 4.15.0-1135.146\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1129-oracle - 5.4.0-1129.138~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1114-raspi - 5.4.0-1114.126~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
