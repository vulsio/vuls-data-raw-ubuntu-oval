This causes the above issue. This patch fixesthe issue by returning NULL if the Ethernet header is not followed by anHSR tag.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26863` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1133-azure - 5.4.0-1133.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-gcp - 5.4.0-1132.141~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-ibm - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-oracle - 5.4.0-1127.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
