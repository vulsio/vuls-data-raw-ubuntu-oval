		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/smc: fix connection leakThere's a potential leak issue under following execution sequence :smc_release  \t\t\t\tsmc_connect_workif (sk->sk_state == SMC_INIT)\t\t\t\t\tsend_clc_confirim\ttcp_abort();\t\t\t\t\t...\t\t\t\t\tsk.sk_state = SMC_ACTIVEsmc_close_activeswitch(sk->sk_state) {...case SMC_ACTIVE:\tsmc_close_final()\t// then wait peer closedUnfortunately, tcp_abort() may discard CLC CONFIRM messages that arestill in the tcp send buffer, in which case our connection token cannotbe delivered to the server side, which means that we cannot get apassive close message at all. Therefore, it is impossible for the to bedisconnected at all.This patch tries a very simple way to avoid this issue, once the statehas changed to SMC_ACTIVE after tcp_abort(), we can actively abort thesmc connection, considering that the state is SMC_INIT beforetcp_abort(), abandoning the complete disconnection process should notcause too much problem.In fact, this problem may exist as long as the CLC CONFIRM message isnot received by the server. Whether a timer should be added aftersmc_close_final() needs to be discussed in the future. But even so, thispatch provides a faster release for connection in above case, it shouldalso be valuable.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48909` to fix the vulnerability.
