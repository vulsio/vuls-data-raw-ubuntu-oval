Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to allocate100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallelexecution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only bymanipulating the processed input stream. XStream 1.4.19 monitors andaccumulates the time it takes to add elements to collections and throws anexception if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are advised to upgrade assoon as possible.
