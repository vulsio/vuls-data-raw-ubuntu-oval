		"description": "pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was found inthe jdbc driver for postgresql database while doing security research. Thesystem using the postgresql library will be attacked when attacker controlthe jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based onclass names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`,`sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback`connection properties. However, the driver did not verify if the classimplements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This canlead to code execution loaded via arbitrary classes. Users using pluginsare advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
