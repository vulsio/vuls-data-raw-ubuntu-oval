		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy A failingusercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in the filedescriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This enables userlandto refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still valid filedescriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free exploitation scenarios.Fix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopy hassucceeded.",
