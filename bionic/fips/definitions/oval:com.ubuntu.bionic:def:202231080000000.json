		"Title": "CVE-2022-3108 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16-rc6. kfd_parse_subtype_iolink in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_crat.c lacks check of the return value of kmemdup(). Jiasheng Jiang discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD Radeon GPU devices did not properly validate memory allocation in certain situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3108` to fix the vulnerability.
