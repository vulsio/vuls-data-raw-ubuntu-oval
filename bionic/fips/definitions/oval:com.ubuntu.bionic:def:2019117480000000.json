		"title": "CVE-2019-11748 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites foraccess to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-partycontext. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software,a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids thepossibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in webcontent and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will nowbe prompted for permissions on each use. This vulnerability affects Firefox< 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-11748` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 69.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 69.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 69.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
