It's possible to fill up theneighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow for validconnections after that. This behaviour is more prevalent after commit58956317c8de (\"neighbor: Improve garbage collection\") is applied, as itprevents removal from entries that are not NUD_FAILED, unless they are morethan 5s old.",
