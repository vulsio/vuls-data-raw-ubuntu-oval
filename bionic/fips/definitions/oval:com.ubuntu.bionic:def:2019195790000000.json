		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gainhost OS privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain hasaccess to a physical device (and assignable-add is not used), because of anincomplete fix for CVE-2019-18424. XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's\"assignable-add\" feature to prepare devices to be assigned to untrustedguests. Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required step fordevice assignment. The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki describesalternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt uses itsown ways as well. Hosts where these \"alternate\" methods are used will stillleave the system in a vulnerable state after the device comes back from aguest. An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA intohost memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where guests aregiven direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through)are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are notvulnerable.",
