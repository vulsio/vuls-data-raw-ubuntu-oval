		"Title": "CVE-2020-14331 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - negligible.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console, calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-14331` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
