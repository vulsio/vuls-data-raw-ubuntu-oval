		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpiolib: cdev: Set lineevent_state::irq after IRQ register successfullyWhen running gpio test on nxp-ls1028 platform with below command gpiomon--num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip1 25 There will be a warning trace asbelow: Call trace: free_irq+0x204/0x360 lineevent_free+0x64/0x70gpio_ioctl+0x598/0x6a0 __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xb4/0x100invoke_syscall+0x5c/0x130 ...... el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4 The reason ofthis issue is that calling request_threaded_irq() function failed, and thenlineevent_free() is invoked to release the resource. Since thelineevent_state::irq was already set, so the subsequent invocation offree_irq() would trigger the above warning call trace. To fix this issue,set the lineevent_state::irq after the IRQ register successfully.",
