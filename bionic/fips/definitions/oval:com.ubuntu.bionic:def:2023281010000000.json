		"description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxeddesktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4,and 1.15.4, if an attacker publishes a Flatpak app with elevatedpermissions, they can hide those permissions from users of the `flatpak(1)`command-line interface by setting other permissions to crafted values thatcontain non-printable control characters such as `ESC`. A fix is availablein versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, use a GUIlike GNOME Software rather than the command-line interface, or only installapps whose maintainers you trust.",
