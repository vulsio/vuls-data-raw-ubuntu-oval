		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Protect against int overflow for stack access sizeThis patch re-introduces protection against the size of access to stackmemory being negative; the access size can appear negative as a resultof overflowing its signed int representation. This should not actuallyhappen, as there are other protections along the way, but we shouldprotect against it anyway. One code path was missing such protections(fixed in the previous patch in the series), causing out-of-bounds arrayaccesses in check_stack_range_initialized(). This patch causes theverification of a program with such a non-sensical access size to fail.This check used to exist in a more indirect way, but was inadvertendlyremoved in a833a17aeac7.",
