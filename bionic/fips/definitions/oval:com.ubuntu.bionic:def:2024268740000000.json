		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flipIt's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL inmtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip().pending_needs_vblank value is set by mtk_crtc->event, but inmtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded by the samelock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.Consider the following case:CPU1                              CPU2step 1:mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin()mtk_crtc->event is not null,                                  step 1:                                  mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:                                  mtk_drm_crtc_update_config(                                      !!mtk_crtc->event)step 2:mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->mtk_drm_finish_page_flip:lockmtk_crtc->event set to null,pending_needs_vblank set to falseunlock                                  pending_needs_vblank set to true,                                  step 2:                                  mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->                                  mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,                                  pending_needs_vblank is still true                                  //null pointerInstead of guarding the entire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's moreefficient to just check if mtk_crtc->event is null before use.",
