		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix underflow in second superblock position calculations MacroNILFS_SB2_OFFSET_BYTES, which computes the position of the secondsuperblock, underflows when the argument device size is less than 4096bytes. Therefore, when using this macro, it is necessary to check inadvance that the device size is not less than a lower limit, or at leastthat underflow does not occur. The current nilfs2 implementation lacks thischeck, causing out-of-bound block access when mounting devices smaller than4096 bytes: I/O error, dev loop0, sector 36028797018963960 op 0x0:(READ)flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 2 NILFS (loop0): unable to read secondarysuperblock (blocksize = 1024) In addition, when trying to resize thefilesystem to a size below 4096 bytes, this underflow occurs innilfs_resize_fs(), passing a huge number of segments tonilfs_sufile_resize(), corrupting parameters such as the number of segmentsin superblocks. This causes excessive loop iterations innilfs_sufile_resize() during a subsequent resize ioctl, causing semaphorens_segctor_sem to block for a long time and hang the writer thread: INFO:task segctord:5067 blocked for more than 143 seconds.
