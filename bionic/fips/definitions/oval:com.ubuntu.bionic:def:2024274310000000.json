		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cpumap: Zero-initialise xdp_rxq_info struct before running XDP programWhen running an XDP program that is attached to a cpumap entry, we don'tinitialise the xdp_rxq_info data structure being used in the xdp_buffthat backs the XDP program invocation. Tobias noticed that this leads torandom values being returned as the xdp_md->rx_queue_index value for XDPprograms running in a cpumap.This means we're basically returning the contents of the uninitialisedmemory, which is bad. Fix this by zero-initialising the rxq datastructure before running the XDP program.",
