		"Title": "CVE-2019-13132 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - high.",
		"Description": "In ZeroMQ libzmq before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.3.2, a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no known mitigations. It was discovered that ZeroMQ incorrectly handled certain application metadata. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause ZeroMQ to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-13132` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibzmq5 - 4.2.5-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
