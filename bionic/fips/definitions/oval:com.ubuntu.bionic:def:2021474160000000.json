		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phy: mdio: fix memory leakSyzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface, the problem was inwrong state logic.MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states:\t1. Bus is only allocated\t2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails, but\t   device_register() was calledIn case of device_register() has been called we should call put_device()to correctly free the memory allocated for this device, but mdiobus_free()calls just kfree(dev) in case of MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED stateTo avoid this behaviour we need to set bus->state to MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED_before_ calling device_register(), because put_device() should becalled even in case of device_register() failure.",
