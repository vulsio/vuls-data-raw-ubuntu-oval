    "Title": "CVE-2020-17527 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "While investigating bug 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 could re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream received on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-17527` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtomcat9-embed-java - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\nlibtomcat9-java - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9 - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-admin - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-common - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-examples - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-user - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
