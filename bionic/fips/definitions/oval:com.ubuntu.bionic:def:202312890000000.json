		"description": "A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a specially created SVGfile loads itself and causes a segmentation fault. This flaw allows aremote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to asegmentation fault, generating many trash files in \"/tmp,\" resulting in adenial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates a lot of trashfiles. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains many renderactions. In a denial of service attack, if a remote attacker uploads an SVGfile of size t, ImageMagick generates files of size 103*t. If an attackeruploads a 100M SVG, the server will generate about 10G.",
