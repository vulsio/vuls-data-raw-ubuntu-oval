		"description": "An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod inRuby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-boundswrite or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expressioncompilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly infetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expressioncontaining an octal number in the form of '\\700' would produce an invalidcode point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in anout-of-bounds write memory corruption.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-9226` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibonig4 - 6.3.0-1\nNo subscription required",
