		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: fix use-after-free in shinker's callbackThe mmap read lock is used during the shrinker's callback, which meansthat using alloc->vma pointer isn't safe as it can race with munmap().As of commit dd2283f2605e (\"mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem inmunmap\") the mmap lock is downgraded after the vma has been isolated.I was able to reproduce this issue by manually adding some delays andtriggering page reclaiming through the shrinker's debug sysfs. Thefollowing KASAN report confirms the UAF:  ==================================================================  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in zap_page_range_single+0x470/0x4b8  Read of size 8 at addr ffff356ed50e50f0 by task bash/478  CPU: 1 PID: 478 Comm: bash Not tainted6.6.0-rc5-00055-g1c8b86a3799f-dirty #70  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)  Call trace:   zap_page_range_single+0x470/0x4b8   binder_alloc_free_page+0x608/0xadc   __list_lru_walk_one+0x130/0x3b0   list_lru_walk_node+0xc4/0x22c   binder_shrink_scan+0x108/0x1dc   shrinker_debugfs_scan_write+0x2b4/0x500   full_proxy_write+0xd4/0x140   vfs_write+0x1ac/0x758   ksys_write+0xf0/0x1dc   __arm64_sys_write+0x6c/0x9c  Allocated by task 492:   kmem_cache_alloc+0x130/0x368   vm_area_alloc+0x2c/0x190   mmap_region+0x258/0x18bc   do_mmap+0x694/0xa60   vm_mmap_pgoff+0x170/0x29c   ksys_mmap_pgoff+0x290/0x3a0   __arm64_sys_mmap+0xcc/0x144  Freed by task 491:   kmem_cache_free+0x17c/0x3c8   vm_area_free_rcu_cb+0x74/0x98   rcu_core+0xa38/0x26d4   rcu_core_si+0x10/0x1c   __do_softirq+0x2fc/0xd24  Last potentially related work creation:   __call_rcu_common.constprop.0+0x6c/0xba0   call_rcu+0x10/0x1c   vm_area_free+0x18/0x24   remove_vma+0xe4/0x118   do_vmi_align_munmap.isra.0+0x718/0xb5c   do_vmi_munmap+0xdc/0x1fc   __vm_munmap+0x10c/0x278   __arm64_sys_munmap+0x58/0x7cFix this issue by performing instead a vma_lookup() which will fail tofind the vma that was isolated before the mmap lock downgrade. Note thatthis option has better performance than upgrading to a mmap write lockwhich would increase contention. Plus, mmap_write_trylock() has beenrecently removed anyway.",
