		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: xhci: prevent potential failure in handle_tx_event() for Transferevents without TRBSome transfer events don't always point to a TRB, and consequently don'thave a endpoint ring. In these cases, function handle_tx_event() shouldnot proceed, because if 'ep->skip' is set, the pointer to the endpointring is used.To prevent a potential failure and make the code logical, return afterchecking the completion code for a Transfer event without TRBs.",
