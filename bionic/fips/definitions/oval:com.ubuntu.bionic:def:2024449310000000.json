		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpiodescriptor array.Users can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to getthe gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().This change ensures that the offset is sanitized by usingarray_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculativeinformation leaks.This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static AnalysisSecurity Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.",
