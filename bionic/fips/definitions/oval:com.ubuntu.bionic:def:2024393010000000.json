However, trace_9p_client_res()ends up trying to print it out anyway before p9_client_rpc()finishes.Fix this issue by assigning default values to p9_fcall fieldssuch as 'tag' and (just in case KMSAN unearths something new) 'id'during the tag allocation stage.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39301` to fix the vulnerability.
