		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm,thp: bail out early in collapse_file for writeback page Currentlycollapse_file does not explicitly check PG_writeback, instead,page_has_private and try_to_release_page are used to filter writebackpages. This does not work for xfs with blocksize equal to or larger thanpagesize, because in such case xfs has no page->private. This makescollapse_file bail out early for writeback page. Otherwise, xfsend_page_writeback will panic as follows. page:fffffe00201bcc80 refcount:0mapcount:0 mapping:ffff0003f88c86a8 index:0x0 pfn:0x84ef32aops:xfs_address_space_operations [xfs] ino:30000b7 dentryname:\"libtest.so\" flags:0x57fffe0000008027(locked|referenced|uptodate|active|writeback) raw:57fffe0000008027 ffff80001b48bc28 ffff80001b48bc28 ffff0003f88c86a8 raw:0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff ffff0000c3e9a000 pagedumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(((unsigned int) page_ref_count(page) + 127u<= 127u)) page->mem_cgroup:ffff0000c3e9a000 ------------[ cut here]------------ kernel BUG at include/linux/mm.h:1212!
