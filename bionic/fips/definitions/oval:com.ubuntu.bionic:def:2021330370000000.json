    "Title": "CVE-2021-33037 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.66 did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request header in some circumstances leading to the possibility to request smuggling when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: - Tomcat incorrectly ignored the transfer encoding header if the client declared it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; - Tomcat honoured the identify encoding; and - Tomcat did not ensure that, if present, the chunked encoding was the final encoding.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33037` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtomcat9-embed-java - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\nlibtomcat9-java - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9 - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-admin - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-common - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-examples - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\ntomcat9-user - 9.0.16-3ubuntu0.18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
