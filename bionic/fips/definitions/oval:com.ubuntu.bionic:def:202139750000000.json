		"Title": "CVE-2021-3975 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister() function in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads without being adequately protected by a monitor lock. This flaw could be triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3975` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnss-libvirt - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-bin - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-clients - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-sheepdog - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-zfs - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-system - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-sanlock - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-wireshark - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt0 - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nNo subscription required",
