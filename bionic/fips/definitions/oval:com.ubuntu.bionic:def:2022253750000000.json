		"Title": "CVE-2022-25375 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. It was discovered that the Remote NDIS (RNDIS) USB gadget implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-25375` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1133-aws - 4.15.0-1133.143\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-aws - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-azure - 5.4.0-1083.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-gcp - 4.15.0-1127.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gcp - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gke - 5.4.0-1074.79~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gkeop - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-ibm - 5.4.0-1028.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-kvm - 4.15.0-1119.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-oracle - 4.15.0-1098.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-oracle - 5.4.0-1076.83~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1065-raspi - 5.4.0-1065.75~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1114-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1114.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1133-aws - 4.15.0-1133.143\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-aws - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-azure - 5.4.0-1083.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-gcp - 4.15.0-1127.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gcp - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-gke - 5.4.0-1074.79~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gkeop - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-ibm - 5.4.0-1028.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-oracle - 4.15.0-1098.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-oracle - 5.4.0-1076.83~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1132-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1132.142\nNo subscription required",
