		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface [Why] We can hangin place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't powered on. [How] Weneed to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command, but theprocess that performs the exit also invokes a command itself. Fixing thisissue involves the following: 1. Using a software state to track whether ornot we need to start the process to exit idle or notify idle. It's possiblefor the hardware to have exited an idle state without driver knowledge, butentering one is always restricted to a driver allow - which makes the SWstate vs HW state mismatch issue purely one of optimization, which shouldseldomly be hit, if at all. 2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idleto use a single wrapper that maintains this SW state. This works simialr todc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the DMCUB level and makes surethe state is marked prior to any notify/exit idle so we don't enter aninfinite loop. 3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending anycommands or waiting for DMCUB idle. This patch takes care of 1/2. A futurepatch will take care of wrapping DMCUB command submission with calls tothis new interface.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52625` to fix the vulnerability.
