		"description": "Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Versions 9.4.21through 9.4.51, 10.0.15, and 11.0.15 are vulnerable to weak authentication.If a Jetty `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional nested `LoginService`,and that `LoginService` decides to revoke an already authenticated user,then the current request will still treat the user as authenticated. Theauthentication is then cleared from the session and subsequent requestswill not be treated as authenticated. So a request on a previouslyauthenticated session could be allowed to bypass authentication after ithad been rejected by the `LoginService`. This impacts usages of thejetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService` and where that`LoginService` will is capable of rejecting previously authenticated users.Versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, and 11.0.16 have a patch for this issue.",
