		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: io-wq:check for wq exit after adding new worker task_work We check IO_WQ_BIT_EXITbefore attempting to create a new worker, and wq exit cancels pending workif we have any. But it's possible to have a race between the two, wherecreation checks exit finding it not set, but we're in the process ofexiting. The exit side will cancel pending creation task_work, but there'sa gap where we add task_work after we've canceled existing creations atexit time. Fix this by checking the EXIT bit post adding the creationtask_work. If it's set, run the same cancelation that exit does.",
