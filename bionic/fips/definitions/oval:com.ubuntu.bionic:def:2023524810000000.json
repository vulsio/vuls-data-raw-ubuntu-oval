		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load workaroundImplement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298. On anaffected Cortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed unprivileged loadmight leak data from a privileged load via a cache side channel. Theissue only exists for loads within a translation regime with the sametranslation (e.g. same ASID and VMID). Therefore, the issue only affectsthe return to EL0.The workaround is to execute a TLBI before returning to EL0 after allloads of privileged data. A non-shareable TLBI to any address issufficient.The workaround isn't necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) isenabled, but for simplicity it will be. Page table isolation shouldnormally be disabled for Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 featureand the E0PD feature (used when KASLR is enabled).",
