		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFOThe SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where theinitial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO datawithout having to resend the register address each time. In this mode, theIC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.The regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which canperform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/writefrom/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode onthe SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabledmanually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, thesefunctions assume that the register address is incremented and handle thecache accordingly.Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order toremove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile socache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.",
