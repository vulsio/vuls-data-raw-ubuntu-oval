		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_taskCurrently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upperlayer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() ormpi_sata_completion().In this case, the following are the two steps in handling those I/Ocompletions: - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of   the I/O. - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in   pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.When complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such,we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in thepm8001_ccb_task_free() call.Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.",
