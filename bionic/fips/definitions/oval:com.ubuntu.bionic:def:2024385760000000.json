		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: rcu:Fix buffer overflow in print_cpu_stall_info() The rcuc-starvation outputfrom print_cpu_stall_info() might overflow the buffer if there is a hugedifference in jiffies difference. The situation might seem improbable, butcomputers sometimes get very confused about time, which can result infull-sized integers, and, in this case, buffer overflow. Also, the unsignedjiffies difference is printed using %ld, which is normally for signedintegers. This is intentional for debugging purposes, but it is not obviousfrom the code. This commit therefore changes sprintf() to snprintf() andadds a clarifying comment about intention of %ld format. Found by LinuxVerification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
