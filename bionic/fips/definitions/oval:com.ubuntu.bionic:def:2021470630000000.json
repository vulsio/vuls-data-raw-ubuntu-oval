However, since ourdrm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, theconnector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoiduse-after-free conditions.v2: Cleanup connector only if it was createdv3: Add FIXMEv4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block",
