		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PMhooksThe ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are notexpected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume().Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.Those helpers have two roles currently: - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker. - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It   requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step twohowever has two implications: - A deadlock occurs, because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context   where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback, where   the usage count is incremented). - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.Here is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:spi_mem_exec_op()        ...        spi_mem_access_start()                mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)        cqspi_exec_mem_op()                pm_runtime_resume_and_get()                        cqspi_resume()                                spi_controller_resume()                                        mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)                ...        spi_mem_access_end()                mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)        ...",
