		"Title": "CVE-2023-0466 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - negligible",
		"Description": "The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitlyenable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification.However the implementation of the function does not enable the check whichallows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass thecertificate verification. As suddenly enabling the policy check could breakexisting deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of theX509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. Instead the applications thatrequire OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to useX509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check bycalling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECKflag argument. Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSLand are not commonly used by applications.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0466` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.12\nopenssl1.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.12\nNo subscription required",
