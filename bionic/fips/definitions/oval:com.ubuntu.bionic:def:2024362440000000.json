		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle tooIt is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by theblamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits acycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of entryintervals. We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle timeitself must be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number ofschedule entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether thecycle time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value,so we move the existing \"cycle == 0\" check outside the \"if\"(!new->cycle_time)\" branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36244` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1011-fips - 4.15.0-1011.12\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1001-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-1001.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1001-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
