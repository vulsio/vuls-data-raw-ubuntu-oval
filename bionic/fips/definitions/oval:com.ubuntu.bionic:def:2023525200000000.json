		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix reference leak If a duplicate attribute isfound using kset_find_obj(), a reference to that attribute is returnedwhich needs to be disposed accordingly using kobject_put(). Move thesetting name validation into a separate function to allow for this changewithout having to duplicate the cleanup code for this setting. As a sidenote, a very similar bug was fixed in commit 7295a996fdab (\"platform/x86:dell-sysman: Fix reference leak\"), so it seems that the bug was copied fromthat driver. Compile-tested only.",
