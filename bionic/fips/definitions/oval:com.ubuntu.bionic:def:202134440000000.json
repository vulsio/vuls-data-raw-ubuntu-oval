		"Title": "CVE-2021-3444 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - high",
		"Description": "The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32destination register truncation when the source register was known to be 0.A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use this gainout-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information disclosure(kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that could potentiallylead to code execution. This issue was addressed in the upstream kernel incommit 9b00f1b78809 (\"bpf: Fix truncation handling for mod32 dst reg wrtzero\") and in Linux stable kernels 5.11.2, 5.10.19, and 5.4.101.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3444` to fix the vulnerability.
