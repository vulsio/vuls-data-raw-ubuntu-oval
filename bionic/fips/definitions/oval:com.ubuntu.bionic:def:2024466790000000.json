		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ethtool: check device is present when getting link settingsA sysfs reader can race with a device reset or removal, attempting toread device state when the device is not actually present. eg:     [exception RIP: qed_get_current_link+17]  #8 [ffffb9e4f2907c48] qede_get_link_ksettings at ffffffffc07a994a [qede]  #9 [ffffb9e4f2907cd8] __rh_call_get_link_ksettings at ffffffff992b01a3 #10 [ffffb9e4f2907d38] __ethtool_get_link_ksettings at ffffffff992b04e4 #11 [ffffb9e4f2907d90] duplex_show at ffffffff99260300 #12 [ffffb9e4f2907e38] dev_attr_show at ffffffff9905a01c #13 [ffffb9e4f2907e50] sysfs_kf_seq_show at ffffffff98e0145b #14 [ffffb9e4f2907e68] seq_read at ffffffff98d902e3 #15 [ffffb9e4f2907ec8] vfs_read at ffffffff98d657d1 #16 [ffffb9e4f2907f00] ksys_read at ffffffff98d65c3f #17 [ffffb9e4f2907f38] do_syscall_64 at ffffffff98a052fb crash> struct net_device.state ffff9a9d21336000    state = 5,state 5 is __LINK_STATE_START (0b1) and __LINK_STATE_NOCARRIER (0b100).The device is not present, note lack of __LINK_STATE_PRESENT (0b10).This is the same sort of panic as observed in commit 4224cfd7fb65(\"net-sysfs: add check for netdevice being present to speed_show\").There are many other callers of __ethtool_get_link_ksettings() whichdon't have a device presence check.Move this check into ethtool to protect all callers.",
