		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A guest may access xenstorepaths via absolute paths containing a full pathname, or via a relativepath, which implicitly includes /local/domain/$DOMID for their own domainid. Management tools must access paths in guests' namespaces, necessarilyusing absolute paths. oxenstored imposes a pathname limit that is appliedsolely to the relative or absolute path specified by the client. Therefore,a guest can create paths in its own namespace which are too long formanagement tools to access. Depending on the toolstack in use, a maliciousguest administrator might cause some management tools and debuggingoperations to fail. For example, a guest administrator can cause\"xenstore-ls -r\" to fail. However, a guest administrator cannot prevent thehost administrator from tearing down the domain. All systems usingoxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the default inthe upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systemsusing C xenstored are not vulnerable.",
