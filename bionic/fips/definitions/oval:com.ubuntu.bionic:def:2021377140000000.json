		"Description": "jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML. Those using jsoup versionsprior to 1.14.2 to parse untrusted HTML or XML may be vulnerable to DOSattacks. If the parser is run on user supplied input, an attacker maysupply content that causes the parser to get stuck (loop indefinitely untilcancelled), to complete more slowly than usual, or to throw an unexpectedexception. This effect may support a denial of service attack. The issue ispatched in version 1.14.2. There are a few available workarounds. Users mayrate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on systemresources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parseruntimes.",
