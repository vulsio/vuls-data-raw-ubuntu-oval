		"description": "LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored inan LDAP directory. LAM's log configuration allows to specify arbitrarypaths for log files. Prior to version 8.7, an attacker could exploit thisby creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code to this file.When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed. Theissue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs to know LAM's masterconfiguration password to be able to change the main settings; and thewebserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAMitself does not provide any such directories. The issue has been fixed in8.7. As a workaround, limit access to LAM configuration pages to authorizedusers.",
