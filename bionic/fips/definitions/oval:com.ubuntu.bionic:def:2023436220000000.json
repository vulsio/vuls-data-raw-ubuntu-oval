This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server,similar to the well known \"slow loris\" attack pattern. This has been fixedin version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly afterthe configured connection timeout. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server:from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57. Users are recommended to upgrade to version2.4.58, which fixes the issue.",
