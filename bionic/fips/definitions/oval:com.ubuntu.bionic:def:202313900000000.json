    "Title": "CVE-2023-1390 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A remote denial of service vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s TIPC kernel module. The while loop in tipc_link_xmit() hits an unknown state while attempting to parse SKBs, which are not in the queue. Sending two small UDP packets to a system with a UDP bearer results in the CPU utilization for the system to instantly spike to 100%, causing a denial of service condition. It was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the queue of socket buffers (skb) when handling certain UDP packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1390` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1095-aws - 4.15.0-1095.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1039-aws - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-azure - 4.15.0-1109.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-azure - 5.4.0-1041.43~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-dell300x - 4.15.0-1013.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-gcp - 4.15.0-1094.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-gcp - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1086-kvm - 4.15.0-1086.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1066-oracle - 4.15.0-1066.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-oracle - 5.4.0-1039.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1030-raspi - 5.4.0-1030.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1080-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1080.85\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1095-aws - 4.15.0-1095.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1039-aws - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-azure - 4.15.0-1109.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-azure - 5.4.0-1041.43~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-dell300x - 4.15.0-1013.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-gcp - 4.15.0-1094.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-gcp - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1066-oracle - 4.15.0-1066.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-oracle - 5.4.0-1039.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1097.106\nNo subscription required",
