[0.000000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idletask! ]--- While ftrace is looping over a list of addresses to patch, italways failed when patching the same function: riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask.Looking at the backtrace, the illegal instruction is encountered in thissame function. However, patch_text_nosync, after patching the instructions,calls flush_icache_range. But looking at what happens in this function:flush_icache_range -> flush_icache_all -> sbi_remote_fence_i ->__sbi_rfence_v02 -> riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask The icache and dcache of thecurrent cpu are never synchronized between the patching ofriscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask and calling this same function. So fix this byflushing the current cpu's icache before asking for the other cpus to dothe same.",
