		"description": "Apache Commons Configuration performs variable interpolation, allowingproperties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard formatfor interpolation is \"${prefix:name}\", where \"prefix\" is used to locate aninstance of org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol.Lookup that performsthe interpolation. Starting with version 2.4 and continuing through 2.7,the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that couldresult in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. Theselookups are: - \"script\" - execute expressions using the JVM scriptexecution engine (javax.script) - \"dns\" - resolve dns records - \"url\" -load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using theinterpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remotecode execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrustedconfiguration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to ApacheCommons Configuration 2.8.0, which disables the problematic interpolatorsby default.",
