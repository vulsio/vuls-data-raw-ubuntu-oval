		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pstore/ram: Fix crash when setting number of cpus to an odd number When thenumber of cpu cores is adjusted to 7 or other odd numbers, the zone sizewill become an odd number. The address of the zone will become: addr ofzone0 = BASE addr of zone1 = BASE + zone_size addr of zone2 = BASE +zone_size*2 ... The address of zone1/3/5/7 will be mapped to non-alignmentva. Eventually crashes will occur when accessing these va. So, useALIGN_DOWN() to make sure the zone size is even to avoid this bug.",
