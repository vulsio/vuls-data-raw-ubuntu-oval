		"Title": "CVE-2017-5754 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - critical.",
		"Description": "Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis of the data cache. Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5754` to fix the vulnerability.

		"Note": "tyhicks> Variant 3, aka Meltdown This flaw only affects Intel processors. AMD reports that their processors are not affected. The break-fix lines for this CVE are not complete since a large number of patches are required to mitigate this issue. The commit(s) listed are chosen as placeholders for automated CVE triage purposes. ppc64el and s390x kernels were fixed with the following commits: aa8a5e0062ac940f7659394f4817c948dc8c0667> local-2017-5754-ppc64el d768bd892fc8f066cd3aa000eb1867bcf32db0ee> local-2017-5754-s390x Unfortunately, the automated CVE triage tooling gets confused since the commits identified by the local-* placeholders were reverted in favor of the upstream commits so they're not included in the break-fix section below."
