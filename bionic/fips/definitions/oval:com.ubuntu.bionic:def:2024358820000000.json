		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: SUNRPC:Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP Jan Schunk reportsthat his small NFS servers suffer from memory exhaustion after just a fewdays. A bisect shows that commit e18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message onTCP with a single sock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit. Thatcommit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in the underlyingbio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't. svc_xprt_release()releases the rqst's response pages, but the record marker page fragmentisn't one of those, so it is never released. This is a narrow fix that canbe applied to stable kernels. A more extensive fix is in the works.",
