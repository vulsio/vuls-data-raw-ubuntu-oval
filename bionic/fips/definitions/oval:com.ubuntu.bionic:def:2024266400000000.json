		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tcp:add sanity checks to rx zerocopy TCP rx zerocopy intent is to map pagesinitially allocated from NIC drivers, not pages owned by a fs. This patchadds to can_map_frag() these additional checks: - Page must not be acompound one. - page->mapping must be NULL. This fixes the panic reportedby ZhangPeng. syzbot was able to loopback packets built with sendfile(),mapping pages owned by an ext4 file to TCP rx zerocopy. r3 =socket$inet_tcp(0x2, 0x1, 0x0) mmap(&(0x7f0000ff9000/0x4000)=nil, 0x4000,0x0, 0x12, r3, 0x0) r4 = socket$inet_tcp(0x2, 0x1, 0x0) bind$inet(r4,&(0x7f0000000000)={0x2, 0x4e24, @multicast1}, 0x10) connect$inet(r4,&(0x7f00000006c0)={0x2, 0x4e24, @empty}, 0x10) r5 =openat$dir(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f00000000c0)='./file0\\x00', 0x181e42,0x0) fallocate(r5, 0x0, 0x0, 0x85b8) sendfile(r4, r5, 0x0, 0x8ba0)getsockopt$inet_tcp_TCP_ZEROCOPY_RECEIVE(r4, 0x6, 0x23,&(0x7f00000001c0)={&(0x7f0000ffb000/0x3000)=nil, 0x3000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, &(0x7f0000000440)=0x40) r6 =openat$dir(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f00000000c0)='./file0\\x00', 0x181e42,0x0)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26640` to fix the vulnerability.
