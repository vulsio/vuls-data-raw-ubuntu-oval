		"description": "shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux,and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuidprograms are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 whencompiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing--disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitablefor use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads toaccount management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel,usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalateprivileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevantin approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., thechmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is nowincluded in the release version 4.8).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19882` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlogin - 1:4.5-1ubuntu2\npasswd - 1:4.5-1ubuntu2\nuidmap - 1:4.5-1ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
