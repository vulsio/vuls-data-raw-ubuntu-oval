		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netlabel: fix out-of-bounds memory accesses There are two arrayout-of-bounds memory accesses, one in cipso_v4_map_lvl_valid(), the otherin netlbl_bitmap_walk(). Both errors are embarassingly simple, and thefixes are straightforward. As a FYI for anyone backporting this patch tokernels prior to v4.8, you'll want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patchto cipso_v4_bitmap_walk() as netlbl_bitmap_walk() doesn't exist beforeLinux v4.8.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-25160` to fix the vulnerability.
