		"Description": "Plexis Archiver is a collection of Plexus components to create archives orextract archives to a directory with a unified `Archiver`/`UnArchiver` API.Prior to version 4.8.0, using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archivemight lead to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote codeexecution. When extracting an archive with an entry that already exists inthe destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist -the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead ofits target, which will pass the verification that ensures the file will notbe extracted outside of the destination directory. Later`Files.newOutputStream()`, that follows symlinks by default, will actuallywrite the entry's content to the symlink's target. Whoever uses plexusarchiver to extract an untrusted archive is vulnerable to an arbitrary filecreation and possibly remote code execution. Version 4.8.0 contains a patchfor this issue.",
