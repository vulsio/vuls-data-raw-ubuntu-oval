		"description": "Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linuxkernels, did not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user()correctly. These could lead to either a double-free situation or memory notbeing freed at all. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service(kernel memory exhaustion) or gain privileges via executing arbitrary code.AKA ZDI-CAN-13562.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3492` to fix the vulnerability.
