		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bnxt_en: Fix RX consumer index logic in the error path.In bnxt_rx_pkt(), the RX buffers are expected to complete in order.If the RX consumer index indicates an out of order buffer completion,it means we are hitting a hardware bug and the driver will abort allremaining RX packets and reset the RX ring.  The RX consumer indexthat we pass to bnxt_discard_rx() is not correct.  We should bepassing the current index (tmp_raw_cons) instead of the old index(raw_cons).  This bug can cause us to be at the wrong index whentrying to abort the next RX packet.  It can crash like this: #0 [ffff9bbcdf5c39a8] machine_kexec at ffffffff9b05e007 #1 [ffff9bbcdf5c3a00] __crash_kexec at ffffffff9b111232 #2 [ffff9bbcdf5c3ad0] panic at ffffffff9b07d61e #3 [ffff9bbcdf5c3b50] oops_end at ffffffff9b030978 #4 [ffff9bbcdf5c3b78] no_context at ffffffff9b06aaf0 #5 [ffff9bbcdf5c3bd8] __bad_area_nosemaphore at ffffffff9b06ae2e #6 [ffff9bbcdf5c3c28] bad_area_nosemaphore at ffffffff9b06af24 #7 [ffff9bbcdf5c3c38] __do_page_fault at ffffffff9b06b67e #8 [ffff9bbcdf5c3cb0] do_page_fault at ffffffff9b06bb12 #9 [ffff9bbcdf5c3ce0] page_fault at ffffffff9bc015c5    [exception RIP: bnxt_rx_pkt+237]    RIP: ffffffffc0259cdd  RSP: ffff9bbcdf5c3d98  RFLAGS: 00010213    RAX: 000000005dd8097f  RBX: ffff9ba4cb11b7e0  RCX: ffffa923cf6e9000    RDX: 0000000000000fff  RSI: 0000000000000627  RDI: 0000000000001000    RBP: ffff9bbcdf5c3e60   R8: 0000000000420003   R9: 000000000000020d    R10: ffffa923cf6ec138  R11: ffff9bbcdf5c3e83  R12: ffff9ba4d6f928c0    R13: ffff9ba4cac28080  R14: ffff9ba4cb11b7f0  R15: ffff9ba4d5a30000    ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff  CS: 0010  SS: 0018",
