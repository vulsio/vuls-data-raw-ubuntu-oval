		"description": "On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binaryis run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases,such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/ofile descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/Ofile descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected contentbeing read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if asetuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it mayleak the contents of its registers.",
