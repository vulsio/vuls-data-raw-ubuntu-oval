		"description": "tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLScryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSAPKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code hasmultiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext.It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLSservers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use theRSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing theindividual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case(see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance arerecommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the securitypolicy of tlslite-ng.",
