		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:crypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FWThe function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL)feature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message tothe firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMAbuffer in memory and returns an array containing the number ofaccelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW.The pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data datastructure called slice_cnt.The array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data()to report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators.An incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an outof bounds memory read.At the moment, there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrongvalue, but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.",
