		"description": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Aninteger overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions ofRedis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result withremote code execution. The vulnerability involves modifying the defaultziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-ziplist-entries,hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries or zset-max-ziplist-value)to a very large value, and then constructing specially crafted commands tocreate very large ziplists. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6,6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem withoutpatching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying theabove configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrictunprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.",
