		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:habanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free ingaudi_memset_device_memory Our code analyzer reported a uaf. Ingaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create() with 2refcount. If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs intorelease_cb branch. One ref of cb is dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could befreed if other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is used by cb->id later,which is a potential uaf. My patch add a variable 'id' to accept the valueof cb->id before the hl_cb_put(cb) is called, to avoid the potential uaf.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47081` to fix the vulnerability.
