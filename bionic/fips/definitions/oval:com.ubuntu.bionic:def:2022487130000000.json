		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range mode Add acheck for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in a placewhere a missing check can cause a kernel crash. Fixes a bug introduced bycommit 670638477aed (\"perf/x86/intel/pt: Opportunistically use single rangeoutput mode\"), which added a support for PT single-range output mode. Sincethat commit if a PT stop filter range is hit while tracing, the kernel willcrash because of a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due tocalling pt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured. The commit whichintroduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses of the ToPA buffervariables with checks of the buf->single variable, but missed the casewhere tracing was stopped by the PT hardware, which happens when executionhits a configured stop filter. Tested that hitting a stop filter while PTrecording successfully records a trace with this patch but crashes withoutthis patch.",
