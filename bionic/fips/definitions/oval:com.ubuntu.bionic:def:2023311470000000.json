		"description": "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom orRtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate randomnumbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also notseeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input from therandom number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation andmay not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation. No attempt is madeto look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widelyavailable. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1.",
