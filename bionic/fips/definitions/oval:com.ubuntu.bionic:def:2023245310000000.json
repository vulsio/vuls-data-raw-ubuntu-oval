		"description": "Command go env is documented as outputting a shell script containing the Goenvironment. However, go env doesn't sanitize values, so executing itsoutput as a shell script can cause various bad bahaviors, includingexecuting arbitrary commands or inserting new environment variables. Thisissue is relatively minor because, in general, if an attacker can setarbitrary environment variables on a system, they have better attackvectors than making \"go env\" print them out.",
