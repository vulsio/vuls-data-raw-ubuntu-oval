		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: f2fs:fix NULL pointer dereference in f2fs_submit_page_write() BUG: kernel NULLpointer dereference, address: 0000000000000014 RIP:0010:f2fs_submit_page_write+0x6cf/0x780 [f2fs] Call Trace: <TASK> ?show_regs+0x6e/0x80 ? __die+0x29/0x70 ? page_fault_oops+0x154/0x4a0 ?prb_read_valid+0x20/0x30 ? __irq_work_queue_local+0x39/0xd0 ?irq_work_queue+0x36/0x70 ? do_user_addr_fault+0x314/0x6c0 ?exc_page_fault+0x7d/0x190 ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x2b/0x30 ?f2fs_submit_page_write+0x6cf/0x780 [f2fs] ?f2fs_submit_page_write+0x736/0x780 [f2fs] do_write_page+0x50/0x170 [f2fs]f2fs_outplace_write_data+0x61/0xb0 [f2fs]f2fs_do_write_data_page+0x3f8/0x660 [f2fs]f2fs_write_single_data_page+0x5bb/0x7a0 [f2fs]f2fs_write_cache_pages+0x3da/0xbe0 [f2fs] ... It is possible that otherthreads have added this fio to io->bio and submitted the io->bio beforeentering f2fs_submit_page_write(). At this point io->bio = NULL. Ifis_end_zone_blkaddr(sbi, fio->new_blkaddr) of this fio is true, then anNULL pointer dereference error occurs at bio_get(io->bio). The originalcode for determining zone end was after \"out:\", which would have missedsome fio who is zone end. I've moved this code before \"skip:\" to make sureit's done for each fio.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26871` to fix the vulnerability.
