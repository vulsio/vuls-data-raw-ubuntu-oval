		"Title": "CVE-2022-3646 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Certified (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3646` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-kvm - 4.15.0-1135.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1078-raspi - 5.4.0-1078.89~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1127-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1127.135\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1145.155\nNo subscription required",
