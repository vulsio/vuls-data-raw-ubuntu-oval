		"description": "RequestStore provides per-request global storage for Rack. The filespublished as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666 permissions, meaningthat they are world-writable, which allows local users to execute arbitrarycode. This version was published in 2017, and most production environmentsdo not allow access for local users, so the chances of this being exploitedare very low, given that the vast majority of users will have upgraded, andthose that have not, if any, are not likely to be exposed.",
