		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: xdp:use flags field to disambiguate broadcast redirect When redirecting apacket using XDP, the bpf_redirect_map() helper will set up the redirectdestination information in struct bpf_redirect_info (using the__bpf_xdp_redirect_map() helper function), and the xdp_do_redirect()function will read this information after the XDP program returns and passthe frame on to the right redirect destination. When using theBPF_F_BROADCAST flag to do multicast redirect to a whole map,__bpf_xdp_redirect_map() sets the 'map' pointer in struct bpf_redirect_infoto point to the destination map to be broadcast. And xdp_do_redirect()reacts to the value of this map pointer to decide whether it's dealing witha broadcast or a single-value redirect. However, if the destination map isbeing destroyed before xdp_do_redirect() is called, the map pointer will becleared out (by bpf_clear_redirect_map()) without waiting for any XDPprograms to stop running. This causes xdp_do_redirect() to think that theredirect was to a single target, but the target pointer is also NULL (sincebroadcast redirects don't have a single target), so this causes a crashwhen a NULL pointer is passed to dev_map_enqueue(). To fix this, changexdp_do_redirect() to react directly to the presence of the BPF_F_BROADCASTflag in the 'flags' value in struct bpf_redirect_info to disambiguatebetween a single-target and a broadcast redirect. And only read the 'map'pointer if the broadcast flag is set, aborting if that has been cleared outin the meantime. This prevents the crash, while keeping the atomic(cmpxchg-based) clearing of the map pointer itself, and without adding anymore checks in the non-broadcast fast path.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36937` to fix the vulnerability.
