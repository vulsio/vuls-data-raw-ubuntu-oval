		"description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to usea specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed portwhile forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find theoutgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmissionID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNSCache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from thisvulnerability is to data integrity.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3448` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.79-1ubuntu0.4\ndnsmasq-base - 2.79-1ubuntu0.4\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.79-1ubuntu0.4\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.79-1ubuntu0.4\nNo subscription required",
