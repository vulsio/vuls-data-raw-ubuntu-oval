		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc2: fix possible NULL pointer dereference caused by driver concurrency In_dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue(), \"urb->hcpriv = NULL\" is executed without holdingthe lock \"hsotg->lock\". In _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue():spin_lock_irqsave(&hsotg->lock, flags); ... if (!urb->hcpriv) {dev_dbg(hsotg->dev, \"## urb->hcpriv is NULL ##\\n\"); goto out; } rc =dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(hsotg, urb->hcpriv); // Use urb->hcpriv ... out:spin_unlock_irqrestore(&hsotg->lock, flags); When _dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue()and _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue() are concurrently executed, the NULL check of\"urb->hcpriv\" can be executed before \"urb->hcpriv = NULL\". Afterurb->hcpriv is NULL, it can be used in the function call todwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(), which can cause a NULL pointer dereference. Thispossible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool developed bymyself. This tool analyzes the locking APIs to extract function pairs thatcan be concurrently executed, and then analyzes the instructions in thepaired functions to identify possible concurrency bugs including data racesand atomicity violations. The above possible bug is reported, when my toolanalyzes the source code of Linux 6.5. To fix this possible bug,\"urb->hcpriv = NULL\" should be executed with holding the lock\"hsotg->lock\". After using this patch, my tool never reports the possiblebug, with the kernelconfiguration allyesconfig for x86_64. Because I haveno associated hardware, I cannot test the patch in runtime testing, andjust verify it according to the code logic.",
