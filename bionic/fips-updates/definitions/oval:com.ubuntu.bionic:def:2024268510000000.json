It will change into negative afterseveral loop. UBSAN load could detect a negative shift as an undefinedbehaviour and reports exception. So we add the protection to avoid thelength exceeding 32. Or else it will return out of range error and stopdecoding.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26851` to fix the vulnerability.
