		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nvmem:Fix shift-out-of-bound (UBSAN) with byte size cells If a cell has 'nbits'equal to a multiple of BITS_PER_BYTE the logic *p &=GENMASK((cell->nbits%BITS_PER_BYTE) - 1, 0); will become undefined behaviorbecause nbits modulo BITS_PER_BYTE is 0, and we subtract one from thatmaking a large number that is then shifted more than the number of bitsthat fit into an unsigned long. UBSAN reports this problem: UBSAN:shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/nvmem/core.c:1386:8 shift exponent 64 is toolarge for 64-bit type 'unsigned long' CPU: 6 PID: 7 Comm: kworker/u16:0 Nottainted 5.15.0-rc3+ #9 Hardware name: Google Lazor (rev3+) with KBBacklight (DT) Workqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func Calltrace: dump_backtrace+0x0/0x170 show_stack+0x24/0x30dump_stack_lvl+0x64/0x7c dump_stack+0x18/0x38 ubsan_epilogue+0x10/0x54__ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x180/0x194__nvmem_cell_read+0x1ec/0x21c nvmem_cell_read+0x58/0x94nvmem_cell_read_variable_common+0x4c/0xb0nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u32+0x40/0x100 a6xx_gpu_init+0x170/0x2f4adreno_bind+0x174/0x284 component_bind_all+0xf0/0x264msm_drm_bind+0x1d8/0x7a0 try_to_bring_up_master+0x164/0x1ac__component_add+0xbc/0x13c component_add+0x20/0x2cdp_display_probe+0x340/0x384 platform_probe+0xc0/0x100really_probe+0x110/0x304 __driver_probe_device+0xb8/0x120driver_probe_device+0x4c/0xfc __device_attach_driver+0xb0/0x128bus_for_each_drv+0x90/0xdc __device_attach+0xc8/0x174device_initial_probe+0x20/0x2c bus_probe_device+0x40/0xa4deferred_probe_work_func+0x7c/0xb8 process_one_work+0x128/0x21cprocess_scheduled_works+0x40/0x54 worker_thread+0x1ec/0x2a8kthread+0x138/0x158 ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20 Fix it by making sure there areany bits to mask out.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47497` to fix the vulnerability.
