		"Title": "CVE-2016-2854 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "The aufs module for the Linux kernel 3.x and 4.x does not properly maintain POSIX ACL xattr data, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging a group-writable setgid directory. It was discovered that the aufs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly maintain POSIX ACL xattr data, when mounted with the non-default allow_userns option. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.",
