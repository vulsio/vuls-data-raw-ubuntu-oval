A KVM guest using SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple vCPUs cantrigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and invoke the`VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to call the handlermultiple times, they can trigger a stack overflow and cause a denial ofservice or potentially guest-to-host escape in kernel configurationswithout stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`).",
