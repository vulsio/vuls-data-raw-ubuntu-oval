		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without triggerThe eventfd_ctx trigger pointer of the vfio_fsl_mc_irq object isinitially NULL and may become NULL if the user sets the triggereventfd to -1.  The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed thattrigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq(), butthe loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler functionneed to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl pathsboth make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.The vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds, nor does itsupport any sort of masking operations, therefore unlike vfio-pciand vfio-platform, the flow can remain essentially unchanged.",
