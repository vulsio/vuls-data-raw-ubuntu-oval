		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without trigger Theeventfd_ctx trigger pointer of the vfio_fsl_mc_irq object is initially NULLand may become NULL if the user sets the trigger eventfd to -1. Theinterrupt handler itself is guaranteed that trigger is always valid betweenrequest_irq() and free_irq(), but the loopback testing mechanisms to invokethe handler function need to test the trigger. The triggering and settingioctl paths both make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.The vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds, nor does it support anysort of masking operations, therefore unlike vfio-pci and vfio-platform,the flow can remain essentially unchanged.",
