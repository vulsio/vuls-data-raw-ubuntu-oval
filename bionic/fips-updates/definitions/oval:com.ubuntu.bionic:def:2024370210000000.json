		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fpga:manager: add owner module and take its refcount The current implementationof the fpga manager assumes that the low-level module registers a driverfor the parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module'srefcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointerdereference while attempting to get the manager if the parent device doesnot have a driver. To address this problem, add a module owner pointer tothe fpga_manager struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modifythe functions for registering the manager to take an additional ownermodule parameter and rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old functionnames for helper macros that automatically set the module that registersthe manager as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existinglow-level control modules and reduces the chances of registering a managerwithout setting the owner. Also, update the documentation to keep itconsistent with the new interface for registering an fpga manager. Otherchanges: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_mgr_get() tofpga_mgr_get() and of_fpga_mgr_get() to improve code clarity since themanager device is taken in these functions.",
