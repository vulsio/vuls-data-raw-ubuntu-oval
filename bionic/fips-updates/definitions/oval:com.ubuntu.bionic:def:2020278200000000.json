		"Title": "CVE-2020-27820 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel, where a use-after-frees in nouveau's postclose() handler could happen if removing device (that is not common to remove video card physically without power-off, but same happens if \"unbind\" the driver). Jeremy Cline discovered a use-after-free in the nouveau graphics driver of the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged or physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-27820` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-raspi - 5.4.0-1060.68~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
