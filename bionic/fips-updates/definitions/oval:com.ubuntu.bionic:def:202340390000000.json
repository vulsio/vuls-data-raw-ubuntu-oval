		"description": "A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains thattarget AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer overflow indynamically-sized local variables in your application without this beingdetected. This stack-protector failure only applies to C99-styledynamically-sized local variables or those created using alloca(). Thestack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized local variables.The default behavior when the stack-protector detects an overflow is toterminate your application, resulting in controlled loss of availability.An attacker who can exploit a buffer overflow without triggering thestack-protector might be able to change program flow control to cause anuncontrolled loss of availability or to go further and affectconfidentiality or integrity.",
