		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:slub: fix flush_cpu_slab()/__free_slab() invocations in task context.Commit 5a836bf6b09f (\"mm: slub: move flush_cpu_slab() invocations__free_slab() invocations out of IRQ context\") moved all flush_cpu_slab()invocations to the global workqueue to avoid a problem related withdeactivate_slab()/__free_slab() being called from an IRQ context onPREEMPT_RT kernels. When the flush_all_cpu_locked() function is called froma task context it may happen that a workqueue with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM bit setends up flushing the global workqueue, this will cause a dependency issue.workqueue: WQ_MEM_RECLAIM nvme-delete-wq:nvme_delete_ctrl_work [nvme_core]is flushing !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM events:flush_cpu_slab WARNING: CPU: 37 PID: 410at kernel/workqueue.c:2637 check_flush_dependency+0x10a/0x120 Workqueue:nvme-delete-wq nvme_delete_ctrl_work [nvme_core] RIP:0010:check_flush_dependency+0x10a/0x120[ 453.262125] Call Trace:__flush_work.isra.0+0xbf/0x220 ? __queue_work+0x1dc/0x420flush_all_cpus_locked+0xfb/0x120 __kmem_cache_shutdown+0x2b/0x320kmem_cache_destroy+0x49/0x100 bioset_exit+0x143/0x190blk_release_queue+0xb9/0x100 kobject_cleanup+0x37/0x130nvme_fc_ctrl_free+0xc6/0x150 [nvme_fc] nvme_free_ctrl+0x1ac/0x2b0[nvme_core] Fix this bug by creating a workqueue for the flush operationwith the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM bit set.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48658` to fix the vulnerability.
