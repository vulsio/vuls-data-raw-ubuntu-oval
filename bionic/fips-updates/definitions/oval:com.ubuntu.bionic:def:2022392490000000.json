		"description": "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Priorto version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver canconstruct messages appearing to have come from another person. Suchmessages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this maybe missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdkimplementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end.Starting with version 19.7.0, the default policy for accepting key forwardshas been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now onlyaccept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and onlyfrom own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on thedecrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decryptthe message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure thatmessages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decoratedappropriately, for example, by showing a warning for such messages. Thisattack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and anattacker, and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39249` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nthunderbird - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:102.4.2+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
