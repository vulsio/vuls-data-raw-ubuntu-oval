		"description": "The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and 6.0.2are vulnerable to buffer overflow. NFSD tracks the number of pages held byeach NFSD thread by combining the receive and send buffers of a remoteprocedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force thesend buffer to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage dataadded at the end of the message. The RPC message with garbage data is stillcorrectly formed according to the specification and is passed forward tohandlers. Vulnerable code in NFSD is not expecting the oversized requestand writes beyond the allocated buffer space.CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-43945` to fix the vulnerability.
