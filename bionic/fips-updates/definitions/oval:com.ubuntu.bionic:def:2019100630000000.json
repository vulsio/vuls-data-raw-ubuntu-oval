		"Title": "CVE-2019-10063 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - untriaged",
		"Description": "Flatpak before 1.0.8, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.4, and 1.3.x before 1.3.1allows a sandbox bypass. Flatpak versions since 0.8.1 address CVE-2017-5226by using a seccomp filter to prevent sandboxed apps from using the TIOCSTIioctl, which could otherwise be used to inject commands into thecontrolling terminal so that they would be executed outside the sandboxafter the sandboxed app exits. This fix was incomplete: on 64-bitplatforms, the seccomp filter could be bypassed by an ioctl request numberthat has TIOCSTI in its 32 least significant bits and an arbitrary nonzerovalue in its 32 most significant bits, which the Linux kernel would treatas equivalent to TIOCSTI.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10063` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nflatpak - 1.0.8-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nflatpak-tests - 1.0.8-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\ngir1.2-flatpak-1.0 - 1.0.8-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nlibflatpak0 - 1.0.8-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
