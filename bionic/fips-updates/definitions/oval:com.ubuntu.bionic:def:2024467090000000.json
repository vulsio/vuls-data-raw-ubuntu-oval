		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix prime with external buffersMake sure that for external buffers mapping goes through the dma_bufinterface instead of trying to access pages directly.External buffers might not provide direct access to readable/writablepages so to make sure the bo's created from external dma_bufs can beread dma_buf interface has to be used.Fixes crashes in IGT's kms_prime with vgem. Regular desktop usage won'ttrigger this due to the fact that virtual machines will not havemultiple GPUs but it enables better test coverage in IGT.",
