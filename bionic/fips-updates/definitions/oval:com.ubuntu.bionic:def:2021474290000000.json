		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/64s: Fix unrecoverable MCE calling async handler from NMIThe machine check handler is not considered NMI on 64s. The earlyhandler is the true NMI handler, and then it schedules themachine_check_exception handler to run when interrupts are enabled.This works fine except the case of an unrecoverable MCE, where the trueNMI is taken when MSR[RI] is clear, it can not recover, so it callsmachine_check_exception directly so something might be done about it.Calling an async handler from NMI context can result in irq state andother things getting corrupted. This can also trigger the BUG at  arch/powerpc/include/asm/interrupt.h:168  BUG_ON(!arch_irq_disabled_regs(regs) && !(regs->msr & MSR_EE));Fix this by making an _async version of the handler which is calledin the normal case, and a NMI version that is called for unrecoverableinterrupts.",
