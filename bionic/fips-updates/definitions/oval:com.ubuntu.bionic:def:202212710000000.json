		"Title": "CVE-2022-1271 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgreputility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (forexample, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content toan arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficientvalidation when processing filenames with two or more newlines whereselected content and the target file names are embedded in craftedmulti-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attackerto force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1271` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblzma5 - 5.2.2-1.3ubuntu0.1\nxz-utils - 5.2.2-1.3ubuntu0.1\nxzdec - 5.2.2-1.3ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required\n\ngzip - 1.6-5ubuntu1.2\ngzip-win32 - 1.6-5ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
