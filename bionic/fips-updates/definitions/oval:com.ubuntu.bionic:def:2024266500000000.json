		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probep2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It guardsthe operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel rescans donot find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock when PCI busrescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan lockspci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices callp2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again. Hence thedeadlock. To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock inp2sb_bar(). Instead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introducep2sb_cache_resources() for fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SBresources. At p2sb_bar(), refer the cache and return to the caller. Beforeoperating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check that itsdevice class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH specificationsdefine. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices at the sameDEVFN. Tested-by Klara Modin <klarasmodin@gmail.com>",
