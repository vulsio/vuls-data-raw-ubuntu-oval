		"description": "BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code ExecutionVulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers toexecute arbitrary code via Bluetooth on affected installations of BlueZ.User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that thetarget must connect to a malicious device. The specific flaw exists withinthe handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from the lack ofproper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying itto a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
