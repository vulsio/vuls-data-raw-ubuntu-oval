		"description": "IOMMU: RMRR (VT-d) and unity map (AMD-Vi) handling issues T[his CNAinformation record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains whichaspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Certain PCI devices in asystem might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via ReservedMemory Region Reporting, \"RMRR\") for Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges forAMD-Vi. These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USBemulation. Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once adevice associated with such a region is active, the mappings of theseregions need to remain continuouly accessible by the device. Thisrequirement has been violated. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the devicemay have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memorycorruption.",
