		"description": "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processingclient pipe names connecting to Unix domain sockets within a privatedirectory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients toremote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Sambainitiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incomingclient pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unixdirectory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clientsconnecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. Ifan attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an externalservice using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead tounauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events,including compromise or service crashes.",
