		"description": "A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messagesfeaturing a transfer-encoding header missing the \"chunked\" value were notbeing correctly rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with the\"http-reuse always\" setting, it could be used to help construct an HTTPrequest smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenientparser that would ignore the content-length header as soon as it saw atransfer-encoding one (even if not entirely valid according to thespecification).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-18277` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhaproxy - 1.8.8-1ubuntu0.7\nvim-haproxy - 1.8.8-1ubuntu0.7\nNo subscription required",
