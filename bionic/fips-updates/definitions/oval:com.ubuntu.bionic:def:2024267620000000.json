		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/pci: Skip to handle RAS errors if CXL.mem device is detached The PCIAER model is an awkward fit for CXL error handling. While the expectationis that a PCI device can escalate to link reset to recover from an AERevent, the same reset on CXL amounts to a surprise memory hotplug ofmassive amounts of memory. At present, the CXL error handler attempts someoptimistic error handling to unbind the device from the cxl_mem driverafter reaping some RAS register values. This results in a \"hopeful\" attemptto unplug the memory, but there is no guarantee that will succeed. Asubsequent AER notification after the memdev unbind event can no longerassume the registers are mapped. Check for memdev bind before reapingstatus register values to avoid crashes of the form: BUG: unable to handlepage fault for address: ffa00000195e9100 #PF: supervisor read access inkernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page [...] RIP:0010:__cxl_handle_ras+0x30/0x110 [cxl_core] [...] Call Trace: <TASK> ?__die+0x24/0x70 ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160 ?kernelmode_fixup_or_oops+0x84/0x110 ? exc_page_fault+0x113/0x170 ?asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30 ? __pfx_dpc_reset_link+0x10/0x10 ?__cxl_handle_ras+0x30/0x110 [cxl_core] ? find_cxl_port+0x59/0x80 [cxl_core]cxl_handle_rp_ras+0xbc/0xd0 [cxl_core] cxl_error_detected+0x6c/0xf0[cxl_core] report_error_detected+0xc7/0x1c0 pci_walk_bus+0x73/0x90pcie_do_recovery+0x23f/0x330 Longer term, the unbind andPCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT behavior might need to be replaced with a newPCI_ERS_RESULT_PANIC.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26762` to fix the vulnerability.
