		"Title": "CVE-2019-19769 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.3.10, there is a use-after-free (read) in the perf_trace_lock_acquire function (related to include/trace/events/lock.h). Tristan Madani discovered that the file locking implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19769` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1019-aws - 5.3.0-1019.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1022-azure - 5.3.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gcp - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-gke - 4.15.0-1030.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1037-gke - 5.0.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gke - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-oem - 4.15.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1052-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1052.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-oracle - 5.3.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1026-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1026.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1022-azure - 5.3.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gcp - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-gke - 4.15.0-1030.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1037-gke - 5.0.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gke - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-oem - 4.15.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1052-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1052.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-oracle - 5.3.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required",
