		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/secretmem: fix GUP-fast succeeding on secretmem foliosfolio_is_secretmem() currently relies on secretmem folios being LRU folios,to save some cycles. However, folios might reside in a folio batch withoutthe LRU flag set, or temporarily have their LRU flag cleared. Consequently,the LRU flag is unreliable for this purpose. In particular, this is thecase when secretmem_fault() allocates a fresh page and callsfilemap_add_folio()->folio_add_lru(). The folio might be added to theper-cpu folio batch and won't get the LRU flag set until the batch wasdrained using e.g., lru_add_drain(). Consequently, folio_is_secretmem()might not detect secretmem folios and GUP-fast can succeed in grabbing asecretmem folio, crashing the kernel when we would later tryreading/writing to the folio, because the folio has been unmapped from thedirectmap. Fix it by removing that unreliable check.",
