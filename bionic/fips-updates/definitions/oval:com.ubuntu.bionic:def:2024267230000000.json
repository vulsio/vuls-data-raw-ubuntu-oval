		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag There is a crash whenadding one of the lan966x interfaces under a lag interface. The issue canbe reproduced like this: ip link add name bond0 type bond miimon 100 modebalance-xor ip link set dev eth0 master bond0 The reason is because whenadding a interface under the lag it would go through all the ports and tryto figure out which other ports are under that lag interface. And the issueis that lan966x can have ports that are NULL pointer as they are notprobed. So then iterating over these ports it would just crash as they areNULL pointers. The fix consists in actually checking for NULL pointersbefore accessing something from the ports. Like we do in other places.",
