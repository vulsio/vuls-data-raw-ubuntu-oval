		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cfg80211: fix management registrations locking The management registrationslocking was broken, the list was locked for each wdev, butcfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update() iterated it without holding all thecorrect spinlocks, causing list corruption. Rather than trying to fix itwith fine-grained locking, just move the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still needthe list on each wdev), we already need to hold the wdev lock to change it,so there's no contention on the lock in any case. This trivially fixes thebug since we hold one wdev's lock already, and now will hold the lock thatprotects all lists.",
