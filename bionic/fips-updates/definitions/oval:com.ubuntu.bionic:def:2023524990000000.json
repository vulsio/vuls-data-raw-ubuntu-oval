When the flush is needed the code jumpsout-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back to continue thesyscall return. However the branch back to label 1b doesn't return to thecorrect location, instead branching back just prior to the return touserspace, causing bogus register values to be used by the rfi. Thebreakage was introduced by commit 6f76a01173cc (\"powerpc/syscall: implementsystem call entry/exit logic in C for PPC32\") which inadvertently removedthe \"1\" label and reused it elsewhere. Fix it by adding named local labelsin the correct locations. Note that the return label needs to be outsidethe ifdef so that CONFIG_PPC_47x=n compiles.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52499` to fix the vulnerability.
