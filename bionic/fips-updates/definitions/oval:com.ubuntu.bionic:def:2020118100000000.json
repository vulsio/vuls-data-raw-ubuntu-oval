		"description": "An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker caninject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id.Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before thedata channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim'sconnection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the smalltime window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim clientconnection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response back to the client.This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-11810` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenvpn - 2.4.4-2ubuntu1.5\nNo subscription required",
