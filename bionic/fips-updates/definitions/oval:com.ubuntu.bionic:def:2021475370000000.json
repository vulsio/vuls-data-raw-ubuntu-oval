		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:octeontx2-af: Fix a memleak bug in rvu_mbox_init() In rvu_mbox_init(),mbox_regions is not freed or passed out under the switch-default region,which could lead to a memory leak. Fix this bug by changing 'return err' to'goto free_regions'. This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysisemploys differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that theinconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or thecallers, so they constitute bugs. Note that, as a bug found by staticanalysis, it can be a false positive or hard to trigger. Multipleresearchers have cross-reviewed the bug. Builds with CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_AF=yshow no new warnings, and our static analyzer no longer warns about thiscode.",
