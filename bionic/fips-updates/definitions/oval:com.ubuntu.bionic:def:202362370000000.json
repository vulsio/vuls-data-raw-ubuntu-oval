		"description": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take along time. Impact summary: Applications that use the functionEVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience longdelays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from anuntrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. When functionEVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is doneto confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n isa product of two or more large primes and this computation completesquickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computationwould take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check()and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could bevulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The functionEVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions howeverit is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For thatreason that application is also vulnerable if used with the '-pubin' and'-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation isnot affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers areaffected by this issue.",
