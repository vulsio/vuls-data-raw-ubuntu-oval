    "Title": "CVE-2022-42895 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "There is an infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_parse_conf_req function which can be used to leak kernel pointers remotely. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b1a2cd50c0357f243b7435a732b4e62ba3157a2e https://www.google.com/url Tamás Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42895` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1136-kvm - 4.15.0-1136.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1080-raspi - 5.4.0-1080.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1128-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1128.136\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1146-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1146.156\nNo subscription required",
