		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages()There are reports from tree-checker that detects corrupted nodes,without any obvious pattern so possibly an overwrite in memory.After some debugging it turns out there's a race when reading an extentbuffer the uptodate status can be missed.To prevent concurrent reads for the same extent buffer,read_extent_buffer_pages() performs these checks:    /* (1) */    if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags))        return 0;    /* (2) */    if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags))        goto done;At this point, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Oncethat completes, end_bbio_meta_read() does    /* (3) */    set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);    /* (4) */    clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags);Normally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, and all othercallers wait for it to finish before returning.  Unfortunately, there isa racey interleaving:    Thread A | Thread B | Thread C    ---------+----------+---------       (1)   |          |             |    (1)   |       (2)   |          |       (3)   |          |       (4)   |          |             |    (2)   |             |          |    (1)When this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read. Worse, threadC will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while the read fromthread B is still in progress.  This race could result in tree-checkererrors like this as the extent buffer is concurrently modified:    BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256    block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356    expect [256, 18446744073709551360]Fix it by testing UPTODATE again after setting the READING bit, and ifit's been set, skip the unnecessary read.[ minor update of changelog ]",
