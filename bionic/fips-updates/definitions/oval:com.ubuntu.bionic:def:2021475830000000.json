		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: mxl111sf: change mutex_init() locationSyzbot reported, that mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitializedmutex. The problem was in wrong mutex_init() location.Previous mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in ->init() function, butdvb_usbv2_init() has this order of calls:\tdvb_usbv2_init()\t  dvb_usbv2_adapter_init()\t    dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_init()\t      props->frontend_attach()\t  props->init()Since mxl111sf_* devices call mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() in ->frontend_attach()internally we need to initialize state->msg_lock beforefrontend_attach(). To achieve it, ->probe() call added to all mxl111sf_*devices, which will simply initiaize mutex.",
