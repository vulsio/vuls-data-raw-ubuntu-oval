		"Description": "A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks. InLDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill upthe disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated Derbyinstallations, this could also allow the attacker to execute malware whichwas visible to and executable by the account which booted the Derby server.In LDAP-protected databases which weren't also protected by SQLGRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability could also let an attackerview and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive database functions andprocedures. Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby10.17.1.0. Alternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versionsshould build their own Derby distribution from one of the release familiesto which the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are thereleases which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11, and8.",
