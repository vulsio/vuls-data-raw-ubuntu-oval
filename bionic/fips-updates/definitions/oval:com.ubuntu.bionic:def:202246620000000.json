		"Title": "CVE-2022-4662 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw incorrect access control in the Linux kernel USB core subsystem was found in the way user attaches usb device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. It was discovered that the USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle nested reset events. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4662` to fix the vulnerability.
