		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input dataAs seen from a recent syzbot bug report, mistakes in the compat ioctlimplementation can lead to uninitialized kernel stack data getting usedas input for driver ioctl handlers.The reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that other relatedbugs are still present or get added in the future. As the drivers needto check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but itmight still cause an information leak.To be on the safe side, always clear the entire ioctl buffer beforecalling the conversion handler functions that are meant to initializethem.",
