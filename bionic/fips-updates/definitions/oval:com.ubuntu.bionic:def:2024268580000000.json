		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Use a memory barrier to enforce PTP WQ xmit submission trackingoccurs after populating the metadata_mapJust simply reordering the functions mlx5e_ptp_metadata_map_put andmlx5e_ptpsq_track_metadata in the mlx5e_txwqe_complete context is not goodenough since both the compiler and CPU are free to reorder these twofunctions. If reordering does occur, the issue that was supposedly fixed by7e3f3ba97e6c (\"net/mlx5e: Track xmit submission to PTP WQ after populatingmetadata map\") will be seen. This will lead to NULL pointer dereferences inmlx5e_ptpsq_mark_ts_cqes_undelivered in the NAPI polling context due to thetracking list being populated before the metadata map.",
