		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:kvm: s390: Reject memory region operations for ucontrol VMsThis change rejects the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION andKVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2 ioctls when called on a ucontrol VM.This is necessary since ucontrol VMs have kvm->arch.gmap set to 0 andwould thus result in a null pointer dereference further in.Memory management needs to be performed in userspace and using theioctls KVM_S390_UCAS_MAP and KVM_S390_UCAS_UNMAP.Also improve s390 specific documentation for KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGIONand KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2.[frankja@linux.ibm.com: commit message spelling fix, subject prefix fix]",
