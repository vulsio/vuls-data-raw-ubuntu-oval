		"Title": "CVE-2019-19061 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A memory leak in the adis_update_scan_mode_burst() function in drivers/iio/imu/adis_buffer.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-9c0530e898f3. It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19061` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-lowlatency -
