		"Title": "CVE-2022-2978 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel NILFS file system was found in the way user triggers function security_inode_alloc to fail with following call to function nilfs_mdt_destroy. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Hao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2978` to fix the vulnerability.
