		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: clk:Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summary Similar to the previouscommit, we should make sure that all devices are runtime resumed beforeprinting the clk_summary through debugfs. Failure to do so would result ina deadlock if the thread is resuming a device to print clk state and thatdevice is also runtime resuming in another thread, e.g the screen isturning on and the display driver is starting up. We remove the calls toclk_pm_runtime_{get,put}() in this path because they're superfluous nowthat we know the devices are runtime resumed. This also squashes a bugwhere the return value of clk_pm_runtime_get() wasn't checked, leading toan RPM count underflow on error paths.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27003` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2013-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2013.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2013-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2013.14\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
