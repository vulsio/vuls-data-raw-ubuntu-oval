		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iio:adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbersChannel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes, or it ispossible to overflow the available storage. Note this bug was introduced aspart of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the ordering of child nodes. Sowe need to support arbitrary ordering but they all need to be theresomewhere. Note I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series.Arguably this isn't the best fix, but it is probably the most minimaloption for backporting etc. Alexandru's sign-off is here because he carriedthis patch in a larger set that Jonathan then applied.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47172` to fix the vulnerability.
