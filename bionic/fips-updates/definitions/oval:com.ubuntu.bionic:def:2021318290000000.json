		"Title": "CVE-2021-31829 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.1 performs undesirable speculative loads, leading to disclosure of stack content via side-channel attacks, aka CID-801c6058d14a. The specific concern is not protecting the BPF stack area against speculative loads. Also, the BPF stack can contain uninitialized data that might represent sensitive information previously operated on by the kernel. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent speculative loads in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-31829` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1051-aws - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-azure - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gcp - 5.4.0-1046.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-kvm - 4.15.0-1097.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-oracle - 5.4.0-1048.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-raspi - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1092-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1092.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1051-aws - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-azure - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gcp - 5.4.0-1046.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-oracle - 5.4.0-1048.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required",
