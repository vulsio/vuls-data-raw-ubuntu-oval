		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix warning during rehashAs previously explained, the rehash delayed work migrates filters fromone region to another. This is done by iterating over all chunks (allthe filters with the same priority) in the region and in each chunkiterating over all the filters.When the work runs out of credits it stores the current chunk and entryas markers in the per-work context so that it would know where to resumethe migration from the next time the work is scheduled.Upon error, the chunk marker is reset to NULL, but without resetting theentry markers despite being relative to it. This can result in migrationbeing resumed from an entry that does not belong to the chunk beingmigrated. In turn, this will eventually lead to a chunk being iteratedover as if it is an entry. Because of how the two structures happen tobe defined, this does not lead to KASAN splats, but to warnings such as[1].Fix by creating a helper that resets all the markers and call it fromall the places the currently only reset the chunk marker. For goodmeasures also call it when starting a completely new rehash. Add awarning to avoid future cases.[1]WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1076 atdrivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/core_acl_flex_keys.c:407mlxsw_afk_encode+0x242/0x2f0Modules linked in:CPU: 7 PID: 1076 Comm: kworker/7:24 Tainted: G        W6.9.0-rc3-custom-00880-g29e61d91b77b #29Hardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
