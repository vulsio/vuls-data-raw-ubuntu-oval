		"description": "An issue was discovered in LinuxTV xawtv before 3.107. The functiondev_open() in v4l-conf.c does not perform sufficient checks to prevent anunprivileged caller of the program from opening unintended filesystempaths. This allows a local attacker with access to the v4l-conf setuid-rootprogram to test for the existence of arbitrary files and to trigger an openon arbitrary files with mode O_RDWR. To achieve this, relative pathcomponents need to be added to the device path, as demonstrated by av4l-conf -c /dev/../root/.bash_history command.",
