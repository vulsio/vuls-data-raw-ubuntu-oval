    "Title": "CVE-2021-41864 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write. It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel when preallocating objects for stack maps. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41864` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-166-generic - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-4.15.0-166-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-4.15.0-166-lowlatency - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-166-generic - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-166-lowlatency - 4.15.0-166.174\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1118-aws - 4.15.0-1118.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-aws - 5.4.0-1061.64~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1129-azure - 4.15.0-1129.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-azure - 5.4.0-1065.68~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1033-dell300x - 4.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-gcp - 4.15.0-1114.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-gcp - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gke - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gkeop - 5.4.0-1029.30~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1105-kvm - 4.15.0-1105.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1085-oracle - 4.15.0-1085.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-oracle - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1048-raspi - 5.4.0-1048.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1101-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1101.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-166-generic - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-4.15.0-166-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-4.15.0-166-lowlatency - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-166-generic - 4.15.0-166.174\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-166-lowlatency - 4.15.0-166.174\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1118-aws - 4.15.0-1118.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-aws - 5.4.0-1061.64~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1129-azure - 4.15.0-1129.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-azure - 5.4.0-1065.68~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1033-dell300x - 4.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-gcp - 4.15.0-1114.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-gcp - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gke - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gkeop - 5.4.0-1029.30~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1085-oracle - 4.15.0-1085.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-oracle - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1118-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1118.127\nNo subscription required",
