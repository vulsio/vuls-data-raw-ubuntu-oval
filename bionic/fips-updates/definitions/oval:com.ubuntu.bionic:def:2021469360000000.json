		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix use-after-free in tw_timer_handler A real world panic issue was foundas follow in Linux 5.4. BUG: unable to handle page fault for address:ffffde49a863de28 PGD 7e6fe62067 P4D 7e6fe62067 PUD 7e6fe63067 PMDf51e064067 PTE 0 RIP: 0010:tw_timer_handler+0x20/0x40 Call Trace: <IRQ>call_timer_fn+0x2b/0x120 run_timer_softirq+0x1ef/0x450__do_softirq+0x10d/0x2b8 irq_exit+0xc7/0xd0smp_apic_timer_interrupt+0x68/0x120 apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20 Thisissue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1], unfortunately, theissue was still can be reproduced after fixing DCCP. The ipv4_mib_exit_netis called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a net namespace is destroyed sincetcp_sk_ops is registered befrore ipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is inthe front of ipv4_mib_ops in the list of pernet_list. There will be ause-after-free on net->mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler afteripv4_mib_exit_net if there are some inflight time-wait timers. This bug isnot introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 (\"mib: add net to NET_ADD_STATS_BH\")since the net_statistics is a global variable instead of dynamic allocationand freeing. Actually, commit 61a7e26028b9 (\"mib: put net statistics onstruct net\") introduces the bug since it put net statistics on struct netand free it when net namespace is destroyed. Moving init_ipv4_mibs() to thefront of tcp_init() to fix this bug and replace pr_crit() with panic()since continuing is meaningless when init_ipv4_mibs() fails.
