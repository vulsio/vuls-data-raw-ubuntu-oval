		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:ena: Fix incorrect descriptor free behavior ENA has two types of TX queues:- queues which only process TX packets arriving from the network stack -queues which only process TX packets forwarded to it by XDP_REDIRECT orXDP_TX instructions The ena_free_tx_bufs() cycles through all descriptorsin a TX queue and unmaps + frees every descriptor that hasn't beenacknowledged yet by the device (uncompleted TX transactions). The functionassumes that the processed TX queue is necessarily from the first categorylisted above and ends up using napi_consume_skb() for descriptors belongingto an XDP specific queue. This patch solves a bug in which, in case of a VFreset, the descriptors aren't freed correctly, leading to crashes.",
