		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: timer: Set lower bound of start tick timeCurrently ALSA timer doesn't have the lower limit of the start ticktime, and it allows a very small size, e.g. 1 tick with 1ns resolutionfor hrtimer.  Such a situation may lead to an unexpected RCU stall,where  the callback repeatedly queuing the expire update, as reportedby fuzzer.This patch introduces a sanity check of the timer start tick time, sothat the system returns an error when a too small start size is set.As of this patch, the lower limit is hard-coded to 100us, which issmall enough but can still work somehow.",
