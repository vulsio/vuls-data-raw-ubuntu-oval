		"Description": "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules,data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in NaturalLanguage Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regularexpression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is presentin PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users ofthis class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. Inshort, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerablefunctions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time.If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizingunpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to aversion of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade theexecution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input toany of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such alimit.",
