		"title": "CVE-2023-1078 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets)protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of alist causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this withrds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info*info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled bylocal user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of boundsaccess, and a lock corruption.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1078` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-azure - 5.4.0-1108.114~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gcp - 5.4.0-1105.114~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-ibm - 5.4.0-1049.54~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1085-raspi - 5.4.0-1085.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
