    "Title": "CVE-2019-11139 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Improper conditions check in the voltage modulation interface for some Intel(R) Xeon(R) Scalable Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. It was discovered that certain Intel Xeon processors did not properly restrict access to a voltage modulation interface. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-11139` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nintel-microcode - 3.20191112-0ubuntu0.18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
