		"title": "CVE-2023-0045 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-updates 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low",
		"description": "The current implementation of the prctl syscall does not issue an IBPBimmediately during the syscall. The ib_prctl_set function updates theThread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL MSRon the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued onthe next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victimvulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctlsyscall. The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigationvia prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. We recommendupgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0045` to fix the vulnerability.
