		"Title": "CVE-2021-23134 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Use After Free vulnerability in nfc sockets in the Linux Kernel before 5.12.4 allows local attackers to elevate their privileges. In typical configurations, the issue can only be triggered by a privileged local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability. Or Cohen and Nadav Markus discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the nfc implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-23134` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1051-aws - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-azure - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gcp - 5.4.0-1046.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-kvm - 4.15.0-1097.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-oracle - 5.4.0-1048.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-raspi - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1092-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1092.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1017-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1017.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1051-aws - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-azure - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gcp - 5.4.0-1046.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-oracle - 5.4.0-1048.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required",
