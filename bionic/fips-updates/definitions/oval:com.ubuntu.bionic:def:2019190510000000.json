    "Title": "CVE-2019-19051 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the i2400m_op_rfkill_sw_toggle() function in drivers/net/wimax/i2400m/op-rfkill.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-6f3ef5c25cc7. It was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19051` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-91-generic - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-4.15.0-91-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-4.15.0-91-lowlatency - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-91-generic - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-91-lowlatency - 4.15.0-91.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1063-aws - 4.15.0-1063.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1016-aws - 5.3.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1009-azure - 5.3.0-1009.10~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1010-gcp - 5.3.0-1010.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1055-gke - 4.15.0-1055.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1035-gke - 5.0.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1056-kvm - 4.15.0-1056.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1076-oem - 4.15.0-1076.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1035-oracle - 4.15.0-1035.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1057-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1057.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1017-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1017.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-91-generic - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-4.15.0-91-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-4.15.0-91-lowlatency - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-91-generic - 4.15.0-91.92\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-91-lowlatency - 4.15.0-91.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1063-aws - 4.15.0-1063.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1009-azure - 5.3.0-1009.10~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1010-gcp - 5.3.0-1010.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1055-gke - 4.15.0-1055.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1035-gke - 5.0.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1076-oem - 4.15.0-1076.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1035-oracle - 4.15.0-1035.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1074-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1074.81\nNo subscription required",
