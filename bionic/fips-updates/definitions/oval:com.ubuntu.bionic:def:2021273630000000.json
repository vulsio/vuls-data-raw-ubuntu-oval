    "Title": "CVE-2021-27363 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernel pointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem, the transport's handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. When read, the show_transport_handle function (in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle. This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in the kernel module's global variables. Adam Nichols discovered that the iSCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to iSCSI transport handles. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information (kernel pointer addresses).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-27363` to fix the vulnerability.
