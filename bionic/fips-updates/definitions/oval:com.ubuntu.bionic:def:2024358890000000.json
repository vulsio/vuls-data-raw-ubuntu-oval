		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:idpf: fix kernel panic on unknown packet typesIn the very rare case where a packet type is unknown to the driver,idpf_rx_process_skb_fields would return early without callingeth_type_trans to set the skb protocol / the network layer handler.This is especially problematic if tcpdump is running when such apacket is received, i.e. it would cause a kernel panic.Instead, call eth_type_trans for every single packet, even whenthe packet type is unknown.",
