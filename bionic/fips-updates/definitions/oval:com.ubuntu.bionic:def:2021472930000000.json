		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_skbmod: Skip non-Ethernet packets Currently tcf_skbmod_act()assumes that packets use Ethernet as their L2 protocol, which is not alwaysthe case. As an example, for CAN devices: $ ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan$ ip link set up vcan0 $ tc qdisc add dev vcan0 root handle 1: htb $ tcfilter add dev vcan0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 10 \\ matchall action skbmodswap mac Doing the above silently corrupts all the packets. Do not performskbmod actions for non-Ethernet packets.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47293` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1057-aws - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-azure - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gcp - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-oracle - 5.4.0-1055.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
