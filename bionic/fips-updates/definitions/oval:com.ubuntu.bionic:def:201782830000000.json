		"Description": "dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU patch program and does not offer a protection mechanism for blank-indented diff hunks, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks via a crafted Debian source package, as demonstrated by use of dpkg-source on NetBSD.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-8283` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndpkg - 1.18.24ubuntu1\ndselect - 1.18.24ubuntu1\nlibdpkg-perl - 1.18.24ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
