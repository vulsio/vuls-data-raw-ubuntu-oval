		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: keep DMA buffers required for suspend/resumeNouveau deallocates a few buffers post GPU init which are required for GPUsuspend/resume to function correctly.This is likely not as big an issue on systems where the NVGPU is the onlyGPU, but on multi-GPU set ups it leads to a regression where the kernelmodule errors and results in a system-wide rendering freeze.This commit addresses that regression by moving the two buffers requiredfor suspend and resume to be deallocated at driver unload instead of postinit.",
