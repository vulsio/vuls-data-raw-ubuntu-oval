		"Description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An infinite loop wasfound in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The infinite loop is triggeredwhen Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a crafted image file. Anattacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial ofservice, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted imagefile. Note that this bug is only triggered when deleting the IPTC data,which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extracommand line option (`-d I rm`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-37622` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nexiv2 - 0.25-3.1ubuntu0.18.04.11\nlibexiv2-14 - 0.25-3.1ubuntu0.18.04.11\nNo subscription required",
