		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:libceph: just wait for more data to be available on the socket A short readmay occur while reading the message footer from the socket. Later, when thesocket is ready for another read, the messenger invokes allread_partial_*() handlers, including read_partial_sparse_msg_data(). Theexpectation is that read_partial_sparse_msg_data() would bail, allowing themessenger to invoke read_partial() for the footer and pick up where it leftoff. However read_partial_sparse_msg_data() violates that and ends upcalling into the state machine in the OSD client. The sparse-read statemachine assumes that it's a new op and interprets some piece of the footeras the sparse-read header and returns bogus extents/data length, etc. Todetermine whether read_partial_sparse_msg_data() should bail, let's reusecursor->total_resid. Because once it reaches to zero that means all theextents and data have been successfully received in last read, else itcould break out when partially reading any of the extents and data. Andthen osd_sparse_read() could continue where it left off. [ idryomov:changelog ]",
