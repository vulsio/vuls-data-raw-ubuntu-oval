		"description": "A statement in the System Programming Guide of the Intel 64 and IA-32Architectures Software Developer's Manual (SDM) was mishandled in thedevelopment of some or all operating-system kernels, resulting inunexpected behavior for #DB exceptions that are deferred by MOV SS or POPSS, as demonstrated by (for example) privilege escalation in Windows,macOS, some Xen configurations, or FreeBSD, or a Linux kernel crash. TheMOV to SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), databreakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundaryfollowing the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibiteddata breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SSinstruction itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by theinterrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If theinstruction following the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction is aninstruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control tothe operating system at CPL < 3, the debug exception is delivered after thetransfer to CPL < 3 is complete. OS kernels may not expect this order ofevents and may therefore experience unexpected behavior when it occurs.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-8897` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1003-aws - 4.15.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1004-azure - 4.15.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-extra-4.15.0-1004-azure - 4.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1003-gcp - 4.15.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-extra-4.15.0-1003-gcp - 4.15.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1004-kvm - 4.15.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-oem - 4.15.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required",
