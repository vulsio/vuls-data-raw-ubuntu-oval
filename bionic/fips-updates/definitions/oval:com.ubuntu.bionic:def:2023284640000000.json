    "Title": "CVE-2023-28464 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "hci_conn_cleanup in net/bluetooth/hci_conn.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.9 has a use-after-free (observed in hci_conn_hash_flush) because of calls to hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put. There is a double free that may lead to privilege escalation. Zhenghan Wang discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle HCI device unlink in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-28464` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1013-raspi - 5.4.0-1013.13~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required",
