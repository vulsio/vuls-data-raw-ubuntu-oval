		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hv_netvsc: Don't free decrypted memoryIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to causeset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that anerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need totake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or securityissues.The netvsc driver could free decrypted/shared pages ifset_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the gpadlto decide whether to free the memory.",
