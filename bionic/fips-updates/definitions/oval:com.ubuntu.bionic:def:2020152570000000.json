		"description": "containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as adaemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host networkcontainers. Access controls for the shimâ€™s API socket verified that theconnecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwiserestrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allowmalicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim,with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause newprocesses to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has beenfixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versionsas soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers startedwith an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, asrunning containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. Ifyou are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containersin the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" networknamespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in aKubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerableto this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerableconfiguration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor byadding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is bestpractice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with anon-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainersstrongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the setof isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases thatcontainer's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used forrunning that container.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15257` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncontainerd - 1.3.3-0ubuntu1~18.04.4\nNo subscription required",
