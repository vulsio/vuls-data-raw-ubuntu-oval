		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: cifs:fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces() In this loop, we step throughthe buffer and after each item we check if the size_left is greater thanthe minimum size we need. However, the problem is that \"bytes_left\" is typessize_t while sizeof() is type size_t. That means that because of typepromotion, the comparison is done as an unsigned and if we have negativebytes left the loop continues instead of ending.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26828` to fix the vulnerability.
