Use 1600x900 to display on host2. Mount ISO through 'Virtual media' on OpenBMC's web3. Run script as below on host to do sha continuously  #!/bin/bash  while [ [1] ];  do\tfind /media -type f -printf '\"%h/%f\"\\n' | xargs sha256sum  done4. Open KVM on OpenBMC's webThe size of macro block captured is 8x8. Therefore, we should make surethe height of src-buf is 8 aligned to fix this issue.",
