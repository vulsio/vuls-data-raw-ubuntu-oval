		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:samples/bpf: syscall_tp_user: Fix array out-of-bound accessCommit 06744f24696e (\"samples/bpf: Add openat2() enter/exit tracepointto syscall_tp sample\") added two more eBPF programs to support theopenat2() syscall. However, it did not increase the size of the arraythat holds the corresponding bpf_links. This leads to an out-of-boundaccess on that array in the bpf_object__for_each_program loop and couldcorrupt other variables on the stack. On our testing QEMU, it corruptsthe map1_fds array and causes the sample to fail:  # ./syscall_tp  prog #0: map ids 4 5  verify map:4 val: 5  map_lookup failed: Bad file descriptorDynamically allocate the array based on the number of programs reportedby libbpf to prevent similar inconsistencies in the future",
