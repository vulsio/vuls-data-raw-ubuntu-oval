		"description": "When api-config-dir is set to a non-empty value, which is not the case bydefault, the API in PowerDNS Recursor 4.x up to and including 4.0.6 and 3.xup to and including 3.7.4 allows an authorized user to update theRecursor's ACL by adding and removing netmasks, and to configure forwardzones.

The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npdns-recursor - 4.1.1-2\nNo subscription required",
