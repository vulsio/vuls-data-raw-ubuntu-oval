		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:core: Fix scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling Several problems existwith scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling: 1) The allocation lengthfield of the MODE SENSE(10) command is 16-bits, occupying bytes 7 and 8 ofthe CDB. With this command, access to mode pages larger than 255 bytes isthus possible. However, the CDB allocation length field is set by assigninglen to byte 8 only, thus truncating buffer length larger than 255. 2) Ifscsi_mode_sense() is called with len smaller than 8 withsdev->use_10_for_ms set, or smaller than 4 otherwise, the buffer length isincreased to 8 and 4 respectively, and the buffer is zero filled with theseincreased values, thus corrupting the memory following the buffer. Fixthese 2 problems by using put_unaligned_be16() to set the allocation lengthfield of MODE SENSE(10) CDB and by returning an error when len is toosmall. Furthermore, if len is larger than 255B, always try MODE SENSE(10)first, even if the device driver did not set sdev->use_10_for_ms. In caseof invalid opcode error for MODE SENSE(10), access to mode pages largerthan 255 bytes are not retried using MODE SENSE(6). To avoid buffer lengthoverflows for the MODE_SENSE(10) case, check that len is smaller than 65535bytes. While at it, also fix the folowing: * Use get_unaligned_be16() toretrieve the mode data length and block descriptor length fields of themode sense reply header instead of using an open coded calculation. * Fixthe kdoc dbd argument explanation: the DBD bit stands for Disable BlockDescriptor, which is the opposite of what the dbd argument description was.",
