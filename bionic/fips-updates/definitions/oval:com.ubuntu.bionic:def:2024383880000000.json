		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: hda/cs_dsp_ctl: Use private_free for control cleanupUse the control private_free callback to free the associated datablock. This ensures that the memory won't leak, whatever way thecontrol gets destroyed.The original implementation didn't actually remove the ALSAcontrols in hda_cs_dsp_control_remove(). It only freed the internaltracking structure. This meant it was possible to remove/unload theamp driver while leaving its ALSA controls still present in thesoundcard. Obviously attempting to access them could cause segfaultsor at least dereferencing stale pointers.",
