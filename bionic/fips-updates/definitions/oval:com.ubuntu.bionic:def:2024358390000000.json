		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: bridge: replace physindev with physinif in nf_bridge_infoAn skb can be added to a neigh->arp_queue while waiting for an arpreply. Where original skb's skb->dev can be different to neigh'sneigh->dev. For instance in case of bridging dnated skb from one veth toanother, the skb would be added to a neigh->arp_queue of the bridge.As skb->dev can be reset back to nf_bridge->physindev and used, and asthere is no explicit mechanism that prevents this physindev from beenfreed under us (for instance neigh_flush_dev doesn't cleanup skbs fromdifferent device's neigh queue) we can crash on e.g. this stack:arp_process  neigh_update    skb = __skb_dequeue(&neigh->arp_queue)      neigh_resolve_output(..., skb)        ...          br_nf_dev_xmit            br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow              skb->dev = nf_bridge->physindev              br_handle_frame_finishLet's use plain ifindex instead of net_device link. To peek into theoriginal net_device we will use dev_get_by_index_rcu(). Thus either weget device and are safe to use it or we don't get it and drop skb.",
