    "Title": "CVE-2023-4921 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. When the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue(). We recommend upgrading past commit 8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8. It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packets in certain conditions, leading to a use after free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
