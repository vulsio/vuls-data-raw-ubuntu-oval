		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: smb:Fix regression in writes when non-standard maximum write size negotiatedThe conversion to netfs in the 6.3 kernel caused a regression when maximumwrite size is set by the server to an unexpected value which is not amultiple of 4096 (similarly if the user overrides the maximum write size bysetting mount parm \"wsize\", but sets it to a value that is not a multipleof 4096). When negotiated write size is not a multiple of 4096 the netfscode can skip the end of the final page when doing large sequential writes,causing data corruption. This section of code is being rewritten/removeddue to a large netfs change, but until that point (ie for the 6.3 kerneluntil now) we can not support non-standard maximum write sizes. Add awarning if a user specifies a wsize on mount that is not a multiple of 4096(and round down), also add a change where we round down the maximum writesize if the server negotiates a value that is not a multiple of 4096 (wealso have to check to make sure that we do not round it down to zero).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26692` to fix the vulnerability.
