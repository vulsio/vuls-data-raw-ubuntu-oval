		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:epoll: be better about file lifetimesepoll can call out to vfs_poll() with a file pointer that may race withthe last 'fput()'. That would make f_count go down to zero, and whilethe ep->mtx locking means that the resulting file pointer tear-down willbe blocked until the poll returns, it means that f_count is alreadydead, and any use of it won't actually get a reference to the file anymore: it's dead regardless.Make sure we have a valid ref on the file pointer before we call down tovfs_poll() from the epoll routines.",
