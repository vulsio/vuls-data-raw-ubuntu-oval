		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:irqchip/gic-v3-its: Prevent double free on error The error handling path inits_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() causes a double free when its_vpe_init() failsafter successfully allocating at least one interrupt. This happens becauseits_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees the interrupts along with the area bitmapand the vprop_page and its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees thearea bitmap and the vprop_page again. Fix this by unconditionally invokingits_vpe_irq_domain_free() which handles all cases correctly and by removingthe bitmap/vprop_page freeing from its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().
