    "Title": "CVE-2022-21125 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Incomplete cleanup of microarchitectural fill buffers on some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform cleanup actions on microarchitectural fill buffers. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-21125` to fix the vulnerability.
