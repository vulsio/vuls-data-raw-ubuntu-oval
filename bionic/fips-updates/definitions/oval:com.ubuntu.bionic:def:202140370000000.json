		"title": "CVE-2021-4037 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() functionlogic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for theXFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group executionand SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID andbelongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member ofthis group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case whenthey should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previousCVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4037` to fix the vulnerability.
