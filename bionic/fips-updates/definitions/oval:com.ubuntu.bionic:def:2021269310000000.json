		"title": "CVE-2021-26931 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as usedin Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug,deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at leastunder the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn'tcorrect to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing suchcrashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affectsdrivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-26931` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-generic - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-lowlatency - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-71-generic - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-71-lowlatency - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1091-kvm - 4.15.0-1091.93\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1043-aws - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-azure - 4.15.0-1114.127\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-azure - 5.4.0-1044.46~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-gcp - 5.4.0-1041.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gke - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1013-gkeop - 5.4.0-1013.14~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-oracle - 5.4.0-1042.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1085-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1085.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1033-raspi - 5.4.0-1033.36~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1102.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-dell300x - 4.15.0-1018.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
