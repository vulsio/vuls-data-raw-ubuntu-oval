		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:qla2xxx: Reserve extra IRQ vectors Commit a6dcfe08487e (\"scsi: qla2xxx:Limit interrupt vectors to number of CPUs\") lowers the number of allocatedMSI-X vectors to the number of CPUs. That breaks vector allocationassumptions in qla83xx_iospace_config(), qla24xx_enable_msix() andqla2x00_iospace_config(). Either of the functions computes maximum numberof qpairs as: ha->max_qpairs = ha->msix_count - 1 (MB interrupt) - 1(default response queue) - 1 (ATIO, in dual or pure target mode) max_qpairsis set to zero in case of two CPUs and initiator mode. The number is thenused to allocate ha->queue_pair_map inside qla2x00_alloc_queues(). Noallocation happens and ha->queue_pair_map is left NULL but the driverthinks there are queue pairs available. qla2xxx_queuecommand() tries tofind a qpair in the map and crashes: if (ha->mqenable) { uint32_t tag;uint16_t hwq; struct qla_qpair *qpair = NULL; tag =blk_mq_unique_tag(cmd->request); hwq = blk_mq_unique_tag_to_hwq(tag); qpair= ha->queue_pair_map[hwq]; # <- HERE if (qpair) returnqla2xxx_mqueuecommand(host, cmd, qpair); } BUG: kernel NULL pointerdereference, address: 0000000000000000 #PF: supervisor read access inkernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops:0000 [#1] SMP PTI CPU: 0 PID: 72 Comm: kworker/u4:3 Tainted: G W5.10.0-rc1+ #25 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS1.0.0-prebuilt.qemu-project.org 04/01/2014 Workqueue: scsi_wq_7fc_scsi_scan_rport [scsi_transport_fc] RIP:0010:qla2xxx_queuecommand+0x16b/0x3f0 [qla2xxx] Call Trace:scsi_queue_rq+0x58c/0xa60 blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list+0x2b7/0x6f0 ?__sbitmap_get_word+0x2a/0x80 __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0xb8/0x170blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x2b/0x50 __blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x49/0xb0__blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue+0xfb/0x150blk_mq_sched_insert_request+0xbe/0x110 blk_execute_rq+0x45/0x70__scsi_execute+0x10e/0x250 scsi_probe_and_add_lun+0x228/0xda0__scsi_scan_target+0xf4/0x620 ? __pm_runtime_resume+0x4f/0x70scsi_scan_target+0x100/0x110 fc_scsi_scan_rport+0xa1/0xb0[scsi_transport_fc] process_one_work+0x1ea/0x3b0 worker_thread+0x28/0x3b0 ?process_one_work+0x3b0/0x3b0 kthread+0x112/0x130 ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30 The driver should allocate enough vectors toprovide every CPU it's own HW queue and still handle reserved (MB, RSP,ATIO) interrupts. The change fixes the crash on dual core VM and preventsunbalanced QP allocation where nr_hw_queues is two less than the number ofCPUs.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46964` to fix the vulnerability.
