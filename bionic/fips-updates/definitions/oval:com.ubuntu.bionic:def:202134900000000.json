		"Title": "CVE-2021-3490 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - high",
		"Description": "The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in theLinux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turnedinto out of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and therefore,arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 049c4e13714e(\"bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations\")(v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, andv5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by commit 3f50f132d840 (\"bpf:Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking\") (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variantwas introduced by 2921c90d4718 (\"bpf:Fix a verifier failure with xor\") (5.10-rc1).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3490` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
