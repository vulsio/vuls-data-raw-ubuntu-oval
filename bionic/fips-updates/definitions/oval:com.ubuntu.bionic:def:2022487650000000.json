		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC The below warning issplatting during guest reboot. ------------[ cut here ]------------WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1931 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10322kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm] CPU: 0 PID: 1931 Comm:qemu-system-x86 Tainted: G I 5.17.0-rc1+ #5 RIP:0010:kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm] Call Trace: <TASK>kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x279/0x710 [kvm] __x64_sys_ioctl+0x83/0xb0do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xc0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae RIP:0033:0x7fd39797350b This can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline modeand doing a reboot in the guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which iscalled in sys_reboot path will not disarm the flying timer, it just masksLVTT. lapic_shutdown() clears APIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bitis 0, this can trigger timer-mode switch between tsc-deadline andoneshot/periodic, which can result in preemption timer be cancelled inapic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on this when not exposingtsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated by preemption timer.Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemption timerunder KVM_SET_LAPIC.",
