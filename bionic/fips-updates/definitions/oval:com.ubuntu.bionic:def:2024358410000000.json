		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:tls, fix WARNIING in __sk_msg_free A splice with MSG_SPLICE_PAGES willcause tls code to use the tls_sw_sendmsg_splice path in the TLS sendmsgcode to move the user provided pages from the msg into the msg_pl. Thiswill loop over the msg until msg_pl is full, checked bysk_msg_full(msg_pl). The user can also set the MORE flag to hint stack todelay sending until receiving more pages and ideally a full buffer. If theuser adds more pages to the msg than can fit in the msg_pl scatterlist(MAX_MSG_FRAGS) we should ignore the MORE flag and send the buffer anyways.What actually happens though is we abort the msg to msg_pl scatterlistsetup and then because we forget to set 'full record' indicating we can nolonger consume data without a send we fallthrough to the 'continue' pathwhich will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send and thenattempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then next iteration ofsender doing send will encounter a full msg_pl and throw the warning in thesyzbot report. To fix simply check if we have a full_record in splice codepath and if not send the msg regardless of MORE flag.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35841` to fix the vulnerability.
