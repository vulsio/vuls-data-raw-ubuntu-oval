		"description": "Netdata is an open source observability tool. In affected versions the`ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows anattacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` toolis packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It onlyruns a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths aresupplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker tocontrol where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path theattacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation.This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169.Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for thisvulnerability.",
