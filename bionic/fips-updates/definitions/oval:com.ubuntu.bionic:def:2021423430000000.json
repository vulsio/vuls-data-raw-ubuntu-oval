		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started withdask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults tousing LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Daskworkers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomlyselected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster createdusing this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable portexposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote codeexecution.",
