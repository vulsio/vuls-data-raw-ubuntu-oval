		"description": "In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS framepayload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves amalicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attackcauses the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability.There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implementnghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGSframe and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then dropthe connection.",
