		"Title": "CVE-2020-29660 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID, aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24. Jann Horn discovered that the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel did not use consistent locking in some situations, leading to a read-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-29660` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-lowlatency - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-136-generic - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-136-lowlatency - 4.15.0-136.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1094-aws - 4.15.0-1094.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-aws - 5.4.0-1038.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-azure - 4.15.0-1108.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-azure - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1012-dell300x - 4.15.0-1012.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-gcp - 4.15.0-1093.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gcp - 5.4.0-1037.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1079-gke - 4.15.0-1079.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-gke - 5.4.0-1036.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-gkeop - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1085-kvm - 4.15.0-1085.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1065-oracle - 4.15.0-1065.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-oracle - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1029-raspi - 5.4.0-1029.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1079-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1079.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-lowlatency - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-136-generic - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-136-lowlatency - 4.15.0-136.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1094-aws - 4.15.0-1094.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-aws - 5.4.0-1038.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-azure - 4.15.0-1108.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-azure - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1012-dell300x - 4.15.0-1012.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-gcp - 4.15.0-1093.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gcp - 5.4.0-1037.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1079-gke - 4.15.0-1079.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-gke - 5.4.0-1036.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-gkeop - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1065-oracle - 4.15.0-1065.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-oracle - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1096-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1096.105\nNo subscription required",
