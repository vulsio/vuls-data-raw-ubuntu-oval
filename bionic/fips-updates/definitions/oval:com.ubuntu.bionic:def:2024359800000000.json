		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: arm64:tlb: Fix TLBI RANGE operand KVM/arm64 relies on TLBI RANGE feature to flushTLBs when the dirty pages are collected by VMM and the page table entriesbecome write protected during live migration. Unfortunately, the operandpassed to the TLBI RANGE instruction isn't correctly sorted out due to thecommit 117940aa6e5f (\"KVM: arm64: Define kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range()\"). Itleads to crash on the destination VM after live migration because TLBsaren't flushed completely and some of the dirty pages are missed. Forexample, I have a VM where 8GB memory is assigned, starting from 0x40000000(1GB). Note that the host has 4KB as the base page size. In the middile ofmigration, kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() is executed to flush TLBs. It passesMAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES as the argument to __kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() and__flush_s2_tlb_range_op(). SCALE#3 and NUM#31, corresponding toMAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES, isn't supported by __TLBI_RANGE_NUM(). In thisspecific case, -1 has been returned from __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() forSCALE#3/2/1/0 and rejected by the loop in the __flush_tlb_range_op() untilthe variable @scale underflows and becomes -9, 0xffff708000040000 is set asthe operand. The operand is wrong since it's sorted out by__TLBI_VADDR_RANGE() according to invalid @scale and @num. Fix it byextending __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() to support the combination of SCALE#3 andNUM#31. With the changes, [-1 31] instead of [-1 30] can be returned fromthe macro, meaning the TLBs for 0x200000 pages in the above example can beflushed in one shoot with SCALE#3 and NUM#31. The macro TLBI_RANGE_MASK isdropped since no one uses it any more. The comments are also adjustedaccordingly.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35980` to fix the vulnerability.
