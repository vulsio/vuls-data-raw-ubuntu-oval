    "Title": "CVE-2020-25687 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received DNS entries. This flaw allows a remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in sort_rrset() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25687` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-base - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
