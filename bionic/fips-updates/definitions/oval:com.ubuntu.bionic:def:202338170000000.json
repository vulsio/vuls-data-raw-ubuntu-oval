		"description": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be veryslow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(),DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parametersmay experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are beingchecked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to aDenial of Service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DHparameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large qparameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some ofthese checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than themodulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q islarger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key orparameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to aDenial of Service attack. The function DH_check() is itself called by anumber of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of thoseother functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected bythis are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are theOpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the\"-check\" option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by thisissue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by thisissue.",
