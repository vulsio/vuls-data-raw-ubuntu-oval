		"description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the FTPconnection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being usedduring subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in aconnection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certainFTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in theconfiguration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This couldlead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-27535` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24\nlibcurl4 - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24\nNo subscription required",
