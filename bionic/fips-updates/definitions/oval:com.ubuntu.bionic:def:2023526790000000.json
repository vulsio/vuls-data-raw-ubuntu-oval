		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: of: Fixdouble free in of_parse_phandle_with_args_map Inof_parse_phandle_with_args_map() the inner loop that iterates through themap entries calls of_node_put(new) to free the reference acquired by theprevious iteration of the inner loop. This assumes that the value of \"new\"is NULL on the first iteration of the inner loop. Make sure that this istrue in all iterations of the outer loop by setting \"new\" to NULL after itsvalue is assigned to \"cur\". Extend the unittest to detect the double freeand add an additional test case that actually triggers this path.",
