		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tpm:efi: Use local variable for calculating final log size Whentpm_read_log_efi is called multiple times, which happens when one loads andunloads a TPM2 driver multiple times, then the global variableefi_tpm_final_log_size will at some point become a negative number due tothe subtraction of final_events_preboot_size occurring each time. Use alocal variable to avoid this integer underflow.
