		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected onesUserfaultfd unregister includes a step to remove wr-protect bits from allthe relevant pgtable entries, but that only covered an explicitUFFDIO_UNREGISTER ioctl, not a close() on the userfaultfd itself.  Coverthat too.  This fixes a WARN trace.The only user visible side effect is the user can observe leftoverwr-protect bits even if the user close()ed on an userfaultfd whenreleasing the last reference of it.  However hopefully that should beharmless, and nothing bad should happen even if so.This change is now more important after the recent page-table-checkpatch we merged in mm-unstable (446dd9ad37d0 (\"mm/page_table_check:support userfault wr-protect entries\")), as we'll do sanity check onuffd-wp bits without vma context.  So it's better if we can 100%guarantee no uffd-wp bit leftovers, to make sure each report will bevalid.",
