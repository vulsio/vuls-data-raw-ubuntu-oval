		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfs:Handle error of rpc_proc_register() in nfs_net_init(). syzkaller reported awarning [0] triggered while destroying immature netns. rpc_proc_register()was called in init_nfs_fs(), but its error has been ignored since at leastthe initial commit 1da177e4c3f4 (\"Linux-2.6.12-rc2\"). Recently, commitd47151b79e32 (\"nfs: expose /proc/net/sunrpc/nfs in net namespaces\")converted the procfs to per-netns and made the problem more visible. Evenwhen rpc_proc_register() fails, nfs_net_init() could succeed, and thusnfs_net_exit() will be called while destroying the netns. Then,remove_proc_entry() will be called for non-existing proc directory andtrigger the warning below. Let's handle the error of rpc_proc_register()properly in nfs_net_init().
