		"Description": "Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network applicationframework. Starting in version 4.1.83.Final and prior to 4.1.86.Final, whencalling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an _iterator_ of values, header valuevalidation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in theiterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has been patched inversion 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work around the issue by changing the`DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()`call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.",
