		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ACPI:fix NULL pointer dereference Commit 71f642833284 (\"ACPI: utils: Fixreference counting in for_each_acpi_dev_match()\") started doing\"acpi_dev_put()\" on a pointer that was possibly NULL. That fails miserably,because that helper inline function is not set up to handle that case. Justmake acpi_dev_put() silently accept a NULL pointer, rather than callingdown to put_device() with an invalid offset off that NULL pointer.",
