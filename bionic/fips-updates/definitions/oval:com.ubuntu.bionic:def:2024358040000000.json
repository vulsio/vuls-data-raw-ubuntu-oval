		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Mark target gfn of emulated atomic instruction as dirtyWhen emulating an atomic access on behalf of the guest, mark the targetgfn dirty if the CMPXCHG by KVM is attempted and doesn't fault.  Thisfixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during livemigration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that thepage is dirty.Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulatedCMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that, KVM explicitlymapped the guest page into kernel memory, and marked the page dirty duringthe unmap phase.Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails, as the old data is writtenback on failure, i.e. the page is still written.  The value written isguaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic, but KVM's ABIis that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.  Andmore importantly, that's what KVM did before the buggy commit.Huge kudos to the folks on the Cc list (and many others), who did all theactual work of triaging and debugging.base-commit: 6769ea8da8a93ed4630f1ce64df6aafcaabfce64",
