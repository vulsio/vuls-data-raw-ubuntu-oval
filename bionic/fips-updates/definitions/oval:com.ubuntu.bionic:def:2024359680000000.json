		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pds_core: Fix pdsc_check_pci_health function to use work thread When thedriver notices fw_status == 0xff it tries to perform a PCI reset on itselfvia pci_reset_function() in the context of the driver's health thread.However, pdsc_reset_prepare calls pdsc_stop_health_thread(), which attemptsto stop/flush the health thread. This results in a deadlock because thestop/flush will never complete since the driver called pci_reset_function()from the health thread context. Fix by changing thepdsc_check_pci_health_function() to queue a newly introducedpdsc_pci_reset_thread() on the pdsc's work queue. Unloading the driver inthe fw_down/dead state uncovered another issue, which can be seen in thefollowing trace: WARNING: CPU: 51 PID: 6914 at kernel/workqueue.c:1450__queue_work+0x358/0x440 [...] RIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x358/0x440 [...]Call Trace: <TASK> ? __warn+0x85/0x140 ? __queue_work+0x358/0x440 ?report_bug+0xfc/0x1e0 ? handle_bug+0x3f/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70 ?asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 ? __queue_work+0x358/0x440queue_work_on+0x28/0x30 pdsc_devcmd_locked+0x96/0xe0 [pds_core]pdsc_devcmd_reset+0x71/0xb0 [pds_core] pdsc_teardown+0x51/0xe0 [pds_core]pdsc_remove+0x106/0x200 [pds_core] pci_device_remove+0x37/0xc0device_release_driver_internal+0xae/0x140 driver_detach+0x48/0x90bus_remove_driver+0x6d/0xf0 pci_unregister_driver+0x2e/0xa0pdsc_cleanup_module+0x10/0x780 [pds_core]__x64_sys_delete_module+0x142/0x2b0 ?syscall_trace_enter.isra.18+0x126/0x1a0 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x72/0xdc RIP: 0033:0x7fbd9d03a14b [...] Fixthis by preventing the devcmd reset if the FW is not running.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35968` to fix the vulnerability.
