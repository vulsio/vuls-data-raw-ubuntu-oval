		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:init/main.c: Fix potential static_command_line memory overflow We allocatememory of size 'xlen + strlen(boot_command_line) + 1' forstatic_command_line, but the strings copied into static_command_line areextra_command_line and command_line, rather than extra_command_line andboot_command_line. When strlen(command_line) > strlen(boot_command_line),static_command_line will overflow. This patch just recoversstrlen(command_line) which was miss-consolidated withstrlen(boot_command_line) in the commit f5c7310ac73e (\"init/main: addchecks for the return value of memblock_alloc*()\")\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26988` to fix the vulnerability.
