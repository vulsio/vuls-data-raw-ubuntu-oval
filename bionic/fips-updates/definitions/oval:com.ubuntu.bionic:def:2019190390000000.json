		"title": "CVE-2019-19039 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-updates 18.04 LTS (bionic) - negligible",
		"description": "** DISPUTED ** __btrfs_free_extent in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linuxkernel through 5.3.12 calls btrfs_print_leaf in a certain ENOENT case,which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information aboutregister values via the dmesg program. NOTE: The BTRFS development teamdisputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because “1) The kernelprovide facilities to restrict access to dmesg - dmesg_restrict=1 sysctloption. So it's really up to the system administrator to judge whetherdmesg access shall be disallowed or not. 2) WARN/WARN_ON are widely usedmacros in the linux kernel. If this CVE is considered valid this would meanthere are literally thousands CVE lurking in the kernel - something whichclearly is not the case.”\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19039` to fix the vulnerability.
