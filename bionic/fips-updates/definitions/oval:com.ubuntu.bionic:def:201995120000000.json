		"description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentiallyleading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to anHTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excessCPU, memory, or both.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9512` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-core - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-mail - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-names - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-news - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-runner - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-web - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-words - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-conch - 1:17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
