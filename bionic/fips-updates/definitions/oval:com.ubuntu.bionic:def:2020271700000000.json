		"Title": "CVE-2020-27170 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-f232326f6966. This affects pointer types that do not define a ptr_limit. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly apply speculative execution limits on some pointer types. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-27170` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-aws - 4.15.0-1097.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1041-aws - 5.4.0-1041.43~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-azure - 4.15.0-1111.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-azure - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1015-dell300x - 4.15.0-1015.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-gcp - 4.15.0-1096.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gcp - 5.4.0-1040.43~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1041-gke - 5.3.0-1041.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-gke - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1012-gkeop - 5.4.0-1012.13~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-70-generic - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-70-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-70-lowlatency - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-70-generic - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-70-lowlatency - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1088-kvm - 4.15.0-1088.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1068-oracle - 4.15.0-1068.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-oracle - 5.4.0-1041.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1032-raspi - 5.4.0-1032.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1082-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1082.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1038-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1038.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-generic - 4.15.0-140.144\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-140-lowlatency - 4.15.0-140.144\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-aws - 4.15.0-1097.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1041-aws - 5.4.0-1041.43~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-azure - 4.15.0-1111.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-azure - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1015-dell300x - 4.15.0-1015.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-gcp - 4.15.0-1096.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gcp - 5.4.0-1040.43~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1041-gke - 5.3.0-1041.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-gke - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1012-gkeop - 5.4.0-1012.13~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-70-generic - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-70-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-70-lowlatency - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-70-generic - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-70-lowlatency - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1068-oracle - 4.15.0-1068.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-oracle - 5.4.0-1041.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1099.108\nNo subscription required",
