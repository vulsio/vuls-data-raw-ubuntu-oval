		"description": "SQL injection in Log4cxx when using the ODBC appender to send log messagesto a database. No fields sent to the database were properly escaped for SQLinjection. This has been the case since at least version 0.9.0(released2003-08-06) Note that Log4cxx is a C++ framework, so only C++ applicationsare affected. Before version 1.1.0, the ODBC appender was automaticallypart of Log4cxx if the library was found when compiling the library. As ofversion 1.1.0, this must be both explicitly enabled in order to be compiledin. Three preconditions must be met for this vulnerability to be possible:1. Log4cxx compiled with ODBC support(before version 1.1.0, this wasauto-detected at compile time) 2. ODBCAppender enabled for logging messagesto, generally done via a config file 3. User input is logged at some point.If your application does not have user input, it is unlikely to beaffected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.1.0 which properlybinds the parameters to the SQL statement, or migrate to the new DBAppenderclass which supports an ODBC connection in addition to other databases.Note that this fix does require a configuration file update, as the oldconfiguration files will not configure properly. An example is shown below,and more information may be found in the Log4cxx documentation on theODBCAppender. Example of old configuration snippet: <appendername=\"SqlODBCAppender\" class=\"ODBCAppender\"> <param name=\"sql\"value=\"INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ('%m')\" /> ... other params here... </appender> The migrated configuration snippet with new ColumnMappingparameters: <appender name=\"SqlODBCAppender\" class=\"ODBCAppender\"> <paramname=\"sql\" value=\"INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES (?)\" /> <paramname=\"ColumnMapping\" value=\"message\"/> ... other params here ...</appender>",
