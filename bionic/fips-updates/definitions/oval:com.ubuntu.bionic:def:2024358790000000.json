		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:of: dynamic: Synchronize of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removalsIn the following sequence:  1) of_platform_depopulate()  2) of_overlay_remove()During the step 1, devices are destroyed and devlinks are removed.During the step 2, OF nodes are destroyed but__of_changeset_entry_destroy() can raise warnings related to missingof_node_put():  ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2 ...Indeed, during the devlink removals performed at step 1, the removalitself releasing the device (and the attached of_node) is done by a jobqueued in a workqueue and so, it is done asynchronously with respect tofunction calls.When the warning is present, of_node_put() will be called but wronglytoo late from the workqueue job.In order to be sure that any ongoing devlink removals are done beforethe of_node destruction, synchronize the of_changeset_destroy() with thedevlink removals.",
