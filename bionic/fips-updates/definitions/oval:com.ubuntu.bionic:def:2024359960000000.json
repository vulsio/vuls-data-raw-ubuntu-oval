		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cpu: Re-enable CPU mitigations by default for !X86 architecturesRename x86's to CPU_MITIGATIONS, define it in generic code, and force iton for all architectures exception x86.  A recent commit to turnmitigations off by default if SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS=n kinda sortamissed that \"cpu_mitigations\" is completely generic, whereasSPECULATION_MITIGATIONS is x86-specific.Rename x86's SPECULATIVE_MITIGATIONS instead of keeping both and have itselect CPU_MITIGATIONS, as having two configs for the same thing isunnecessary and confusing.  This will also allow x86 to use the knob tomanage mitigations that aren't strictly related to speculativeexecution.Use another Kconfig to communicate to common code that CPU_MITIGATIONSis already defined instead of having x86's menu depend on the commonCPU_MITIGATIONS.  This allows keeping a single point of contact for allof x86's mitigations, and it's not clear that other architectures *want*to allow disabling mitigations at compile-time.",
