		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6:fix another slab-out-of-bounds in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions While runningthe self-tests on a KASAN enabled kernel, I observed a slab-out-of-boundssplat very similar to the one reported in commit 821bbf79fe46 (\"ipv6: FixKASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions\"). Weadditionally need to take care of fib6_metrics initialization failure whenthe caller provides an nh. The fix is similar, explicitly free the routeinstead of calling fib6_info_release on a half-initialized object.",
