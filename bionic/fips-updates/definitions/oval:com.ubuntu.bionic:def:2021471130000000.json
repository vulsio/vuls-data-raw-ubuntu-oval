		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second ref Errorinjection stress uncovered a problem where we'd leave a dangling inode refif we failed during a rename_exchange. This happens because we insert theinode ref for one side of the rename, and then for the other side. If thissecond inode ref insert fails we'll leave the first one dangling and leavea corrupt file system behind. Fix this by aborting if we did the insert forthe first inode ref.",
