		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:char: xillybus: Check USB endpoints when probing deviceEnsure, as the driver probes the device, that all endpoints that thedriver may attempt to access exist and are of the correct type.All XillyUSB devices must have a Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoint ataddress 1. This is verified in xillyusb_setup_base_eps().On top of that, a XillyUSB device may have additional Bulk OUTendpoints. The information about these endpoints' addresses is deducedfrom a data structure (the IDT) that the driver fetches from the devicewhile probing it. These endpoints are checked in setup_channels().A XillyUSB device never has more than one IN endpoint, as all datatowards the host is multiplexed in this single Bulk IN endpoint. This iswhy setup_channels() only checks OUT endpoints.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45011` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2013-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2013.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2013-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2013.14\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
