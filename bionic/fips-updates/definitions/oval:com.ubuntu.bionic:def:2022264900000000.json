		"Title": "CVE-2022-26490 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "st21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c in the Linux kernel through 5.16.12 has EVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length parameters. It was discovered that the ST21NFCA NFC driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of certain data in EVT_TRANSACTION events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-26490` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-lowlatency - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-lowlatency - 4.15.0-177.186\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1128-aws - 4.15.0-1128.137\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1042-dell300x - 4.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-gcp - 4.15.0-1122.136\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1114-kvm - 4.15.0-1114.117\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-oracle - 4.15.0-1093.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-raspi - 5.4.0-1060.68~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-4.15.0-177-lowlatency - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-generic - 4.15.0-177.186\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-177-lowlatency - 4.15.0-177.186\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1128-aws - 4.15.0-1128.137\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1042-dell300x - 4.15.0-1042.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-gcp - 4.15.0-1122.136\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-oracle - 4.15.0-1093.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1127-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1127.136\nNo subscription required",
