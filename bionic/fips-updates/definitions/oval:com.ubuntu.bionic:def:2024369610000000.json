		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal/debugfs: Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debugWith the current thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code,user space can open the \"mitigations\" file for a thermal zone beforethe zone's debugfs pointer is set which will result in a NULL pointerdereference in tze_seq_start().Moreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called under the thermalzone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functions accessingthe thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.  Then, it may cleartz->debugfs after one of those functions has checked it and thestruct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely.To address the first problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zone'sstruct thermal_debugfs object to debugfs_create_file() inthermal_debug_tz_add() and make tze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(),tze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show() retrieve it from s->privateinstead of a pointer to the thermal zone object.  This will ensurethat tz_debugfs will be valid across the \"mitigations\" file accessesuntil thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called by thermal_debug_tz_remove()removes that file.To address the second problem, use tz->lock in thermal_debug_tz_remove()around the tz->debugfs value check (in case the same thermal zone isremoved at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.Cc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+",
