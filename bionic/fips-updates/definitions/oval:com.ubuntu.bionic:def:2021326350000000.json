		"Title": "CVE-2021-32635 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "Singularity is an open source container platform. In verions 3.7.2 and3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands(`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI willalways attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint(`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attackermay be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpointwith a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-defaultremote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only actioncommands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected.Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remoteendpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Twopossible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the default remoteendpoint, or an installation can have an execution control list configuredto restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys.",
