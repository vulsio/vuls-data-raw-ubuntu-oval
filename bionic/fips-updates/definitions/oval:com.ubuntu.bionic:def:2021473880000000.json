		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mac80211: fix use-after-free in CCMP/GCMP RX When PN checking is done inmac80211, for fragmentation we need to copy the PN to the RX struct so wecan later use it to do a comparison, since commit bf30ca922a0c (\"mac80211:check defrag PN against current frame\"). Unfortunately, in that commit Iused the 'hdr' variable without it being necessarily valid, souse-after-free could occur if it was necessary to reallocate (parts of) theframe. Fix this by reloading the variable after the code that results inthe reallocations, if any. This fixeshttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214401.",
