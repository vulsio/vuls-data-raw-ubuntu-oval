		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: sunxi-ng: h6: Reparent CPUX during PLL CPUX rate changeWhile PLL CPUX clock rate change when CPU is running from it works invast majority of cases, now and then it causes instability. This leadsto system crashes and other undefined behaviour. After a lot of testing(30+ hours) while also doing a lot of frequency switches, we can'tobserve any instability issues anymore when doing reparenting to stableclock like 24 MHz oscillator.",
