		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder:fix race between mmput() and do_exit() Task A callsbinder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on a remote addressspace from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm via mmget_not_zero()first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the final mmput() refcountdecrement will come from Task A. Task A | Task B------------------+------------------ mmget_not_zero() | | do_exit() |exit_mm() | mmput() mmput() | exit_mmap() | remove_vma() | fput() | In thiscase, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A asTWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup workgets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply from TaskB that never comes (it's dead). This means the binder_deferred_release() isblocked until an unrelated binder event forces Task A to go back touserspace. All the associated death notifications will also be delayeduntil then. In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule thework in the corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.",
