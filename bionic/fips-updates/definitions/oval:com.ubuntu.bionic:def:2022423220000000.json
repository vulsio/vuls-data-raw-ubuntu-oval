This will allow two malicious guests working together to create anarbitrary number of Xenstore nodes. This is possible by domain A lettingdomain B write into domain A's local Xenstore tree. Domain B can thencreate many nodes and reboot. The nodes created by domain B will now beowned by Dom0. By repeating this process over and over again an arbitrarynumber of nodes can be created, as Dom0's number of nodes isn't limited byXenstore quota.",
