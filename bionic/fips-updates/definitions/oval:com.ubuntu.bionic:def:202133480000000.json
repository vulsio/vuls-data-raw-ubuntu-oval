		"Title": "CVE-2021-3348 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "nbd_add_socket in drivers/block/nbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.12 has an ndb_queue_rq use-after-free that could be triggered by local attackers (with access to the nbd device) via an I/O request at a certain point during device setup, aka CID-b98e762e3d71. It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability during device setup. A local attacker with access to the nbd device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3348` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-141-generic - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-4.15.0-141-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-4.15.0-141-lowlatency - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-141-generic - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-141-lowlatency - 4.15.0-141.145\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1098-aws - 4.15.0-1098.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1043-aws - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-azure - 4.15.0-1112.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-azure - 5.4.0-1044.46~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1016-dell300x - 4.15.0-1016.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1097-gcp - 4.15.0-1097.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-gcp - 5.4.0-1041.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gke - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1013-gkeop - 5.4.0-1013.14~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-generic - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-lowlatency - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-71-generic - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-71-lowlatency - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1089-kvm - 4.15.0-1089.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1069-oracle - 4.15.0-1069.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-oracle - 5.4.0-1042.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1033-raspi - 5.4.0-1033.36~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1083-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1083.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-141-generic - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-4.15.0-141-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-4.15.0-141-lowlatency - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-141-generic - 4.15.0-141.145\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-141-lowlatency - 4.15.0-141.145\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1098-aws - 4.15.0-1098.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1043-aws - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-azure - 4.15.0-1112.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-azure - 5.4.0-1044.46~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1016-dell300x - 4.15.0-1016.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1097-gcp - 4.15.0-1097.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-gcp - 5.4.0-1041.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gke - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1013-gkeop - 5.4.0-1013.14~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-generic - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-71-lowlatency - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-71-generic - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-71-lowlatency - 5.4.0-71.79~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1069-oracle - 4.15.0-1069.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-oracle - 5.4.0-1042.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1100-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1100.109\nNo subscription required",
