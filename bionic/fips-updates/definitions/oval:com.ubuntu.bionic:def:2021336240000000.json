    "Title": "CVE-2021-33624 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "In kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db. Ofek Kirzner, Adam Morrison, Benedict Schlueter, and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel missed possible mispredicted branches due to type confusion, allowing a side-channel attack. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33624` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1057-aws - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-azure - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gcp - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gke - 5.4.0-1053.56~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-gkeop - 5.4.0-1024.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-oracle - 5.4.0-1055.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1057-aws - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-azure - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gcp - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gke - 5.4.0-1053.56~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-gkeop - 5.4.0-1024.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-oracle - 5.4.0-1055.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
