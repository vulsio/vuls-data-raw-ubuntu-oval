		"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due toincorrect data validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may succeedagainst HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allowsany client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poisonthe proxy cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrarysource. When configured for relaxed header parsing (the default), Squidrelays headers containing whitespace characters to upstream servers. Whenthis occurs as a prefix to a Content-Length header, the frame lengthspecified will be ignored by Squid (allowing for a conflicting length to beused from another Content-Length header) but relayed upstream.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15810` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid-cgi - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid-common - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid-purge - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid3 - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquidclient - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nNo subscription required",
