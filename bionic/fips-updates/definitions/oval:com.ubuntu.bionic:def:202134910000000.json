		"title": "CVE-2021-3491 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - high",
		"description": "The io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed the MAX_RW_COUNT limitto be bypassed in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which led to negativevalues being usedin mem_rw when reading /proc/<PID>/mem. This could be usedto create a heap overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in thekernel. It was addressed via commit d1f82808877b (\"io_uring: truncatelengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers\") (v5.13-rc1) andbackported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It wasintroduced in ddf0322db79c (\"io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS\")(v5.7-rc1).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3491` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
