		"description": "It was discovered that libvirtd, versions 4.x.x before 4.10.1 and 5.x.xbefore 5.4.1, would permit readonly clients to use thevirDomainManagedSaveDefineXML() API, which would permit them to modifymanaged save state files. If a managed save had already been created by aprivileged user, a local attacker could modify this file such that libvirtdwould execute an arbitrary program when the domain was resumed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10166` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnss-libvirt - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-bin - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-clients - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-sheepdog - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-zfs - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-daemon-system - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-sanlock - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt-wireshark - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nlibvirt0 - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.12\nNo subscription required",
