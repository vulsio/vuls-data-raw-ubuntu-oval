		"Description": "In gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show of configfs.c, there is a possible disclosure of kernel heap memory due to a race condition. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-160822094References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the configfs interface for USB gadgets in the Linux kernel contained a race condition.
