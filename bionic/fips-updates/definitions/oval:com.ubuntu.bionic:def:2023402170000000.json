		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Python before 3.8.18, 3.9.x before 3.9.18,3.10.x before 3.10.13, and 3.11.x before 3.11.5. It primarily affectsservers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLSserver-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, andthen is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocketinstance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate ahandshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer.This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer isexpecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable fromvalid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fitin the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for dataexfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connectionbe closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",
