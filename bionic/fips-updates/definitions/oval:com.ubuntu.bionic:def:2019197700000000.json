		"description": "** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free(read) in the debugfs_remove function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is usedto remove a file or directory in debugfs that was previously created with acall to another debugfs function such as debugfs_create_file). NOTE: Linuxkernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs,instead this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19770` to fix the vulnerability.
