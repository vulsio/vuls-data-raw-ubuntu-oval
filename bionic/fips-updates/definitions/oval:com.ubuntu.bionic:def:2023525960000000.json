		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sysctl:Fix out of bounds access for empty sysctl registers When registering tablesto the sysctl subsystem there is a check to see if header is a permanentlyempty directory (used for mounts). This check evaluates the first elementof the ctl_table. This results in an out of bounds evaluation whenregistering empty directories. The function register_sysctl_mount_point nowpasses a ctl_table of size 1 instead of size 0. It now relies solely on thetype to identify a permanently empty register. Make sure that the ctl_tablehas at least one element before testing for permanent emptiness.",
