		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/smc: Transitional solution for clcsock race issueWe encountered a crash in smc_setsockopt() and it is caused byaccessing smc->clcsock after clcsock was released. BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI CPU: 1 PID: 50309 Comm: nginx Kdump: loaded Tainted: G E     5.16.0-rc4+#53 RIP: 0010:smc_setsockopt+0x59/0x280 [smc] Call Trace:  <TASK>  __sys_setsockopt+0xfc/0x190  __x64_sys_setsockopt+0x20/0x30  do_syscall_64+0x34/0x90  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae RIP: 0033:0x7f16ba83918e  </TASK>This patch tries to fix it by holding clcsock_release_lock andchecking whether clcsock has already been released before access.In case that a crash of the same reason happens in smc_getsockopt()or smc_switch_to_fallback(), this patch also checkes smc->clcsockin them too. And the caller of smc_switch_to_fallback() will identifywhether fallback succeeds according to the return value.",
