		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadlIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to causeset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that anerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need totake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or securityissues.In order to make sure callers of vmbus_establish_gpadl() andvmbus_teardown_gpadl() don't return decrypted/shared pages toallocators, add a field in struct vmbus_gpadl to keep track of thedecryption status of the buffers. This will allow the callers toknow if they should free or leak the pages.",
