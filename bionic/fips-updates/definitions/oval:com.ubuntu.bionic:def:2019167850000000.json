		"description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230which states: \"Although the line terminator for the start-line and headerfields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as aline terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\" Unfortunately if a front-endserver does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it doesthose with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end serverparsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to apotential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see tworequests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. Thisissue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.",
