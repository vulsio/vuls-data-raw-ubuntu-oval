		"Title": "CVE-2021-23133 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c) before5.12-rc8 can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of anetwork service or an unprivileged process. If sctp_destroy_sock is calledwithout sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock then an element is removed from theauto_asconf_splist list without any proper locking. This can be exploitedby an attacker with network service privileges to escalate to root or fromthe context of an unprivileged user directly if aBPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE is attached which denies creation of some SCTPsocket.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-23133` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-generic - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-lowlatency - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-147-generic - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-147-lowlatency - 4.15.0-147.151\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1094-kvm - 4.15.0-1094.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1106-aws - 4.15.0-1106.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1051-aws - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1118-azure - 4.15.0-1118.131\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-azure - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-dell300x - 4.15.0-1022.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1103-gcp - 4.15.0-1103.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gcp - 5.4.0-1046.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1075-oracle - 4.15.0-1075.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-oracle - 5.4.0-1048.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1089-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-raspi - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1106-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
