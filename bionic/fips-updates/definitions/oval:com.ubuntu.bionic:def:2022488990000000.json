		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/virtio: Fix GEM handle creation UAFUserspace can guess the handle value and try to race GEM object creationwith handle close, resulting in a use-after-free if we dereference theobject after dropping the handle's reference.  For that reason, droppingthe handle's reference must be done *after* we are done dereferencingthe object.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48899` to fix the vulnerability.
