		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers/virt/acrn: fix PFNMAP PTE checks in acrn_vm_ram_map() Patch series\"mm: follow_pte() improvements and acrn follow_pte() fixes\". Patch #1 fixesa bunch of issues I spotted in the acrn driver. It compiles, that's all Iknow. I'll appreciate some review and testing from acrn folks. Patch #2+#3improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, adding more sanitychecks, and improving the documentation. Gave it a quick test on x86-64using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte(). This patch (of 3): Wecurrently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerousfollow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage. (1) We're not checking PTEwrite permissions. Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() likewe do for pin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so let's check forACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now. (2) We're not rejecting refcounted pages. Aswe are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages is dangerousand can result in use-after-free. Let's make sure to reject them. (3) Weare only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range. We only lookup asingle PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area. Let's loop over allinvolved PTEs and make sure the PFN range is actually contiguous. Rejecteverything else: it couldn't have worked either way, and rather made useaccess PFNs we shouldn't be accessing.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38610` to fix the vulnerability.
