		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: can:j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock Thefollowing 3 locks would race against each other, causing the deadlocksituation in the Syzbot bug report: - j1939_socks_lock -active_session_list_lock - sk_session_queue_lock A reasonable fix is tochange j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since in the rare situations where awrite lock is required for the linked list that j1939_socks_lock isprotecting, the code does not attempt to acquire any more locks. This wouldbreak the circular lock dependency, where, for example, the current threadalready locks j1939_socks_lock and attempts to acquiresk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time, another thread attempts toacquire j1939_socks_lock while holding sk_session_queue_lock. NOTE: Thispatch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug reported by Syzbot;instead, it solves a deadlock situation to prepare for one or more furtherpatches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, which appears to be a referencecounting problem within the j1939 codebase.
