		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: igbvf:fix double free in `igbvf_probe` In `igbvf_probe`, if register_netdev()fails, the program will go to label err_hw_init, and then to labelerr_ioremap. In free_netdev() which is just below label err_ioremap, thereis `list_for_each_entry_safe` and `netif_napi_del` which aims to delete allentries in `dev->napi_list`. The program has added an entry`adapter->rx_ring->napi` which is added by `netif_napi_add` inigbvf_alloc_queues(). However, adapter->rx_ring has been freed below labelerr_hw_init. So this a UAF. In terms of how to patch the problem, we canrefer to igbvf_remove() and delete the entry before `adapter->rx_ring`. TheKASAN logs are as follows: [ 35.126075] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free infree_netdev+0x1fd/0x450 [ 35.127170] Read of size 8 at addrffff88810126d990 by task modprobe/366 [ 35.128360] [ 35.128643] CPU: 1 PID:366 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #14 [ 35.129789] Hardware name:QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOSrel-1.12.0-59-gc9ba5276e321-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014 [ 35.131749] CallTrace: [ 35.132199] dump_stack_lvl+0x59/0x7b [ 35.132865]print_address_description+0x7c/0x3b0 [ 35.133707] ? free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450[ 35.134378] __kasan_report+0x160/0x1c0 [ 35.135063] ?free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450 [ 35.135738] kasan_report+0x4b/0x70 [ 35.136367]free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450 [ 35.137006] igbvf_probe+0x121d/0x1a10 [igbvf] [35.137808] ? igbvf_vlan_rx_add_vid+0x100/0x100 [igbvf] [ 35.138751]local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0 [ 35.139461] pci_device_probe+0x37e/0x6c0 [35.165526] [ 35.165806] Allocated by task 366: [ 35.166414]____kasan_kmalloc+0xc4/0xf0 [ 35.167117]foo_kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x3c/0x50 [igbvf] [ 35.168078]igbvf_probe+0x9c5/0x1a10 [igbvf] [ 35.168866] local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0 [35.169565] pci_device_probe+0x37e/0x6c0 [ 35.179713] [ 35.179993] Freed bytask 366: [ 35.180539] kasan_set_track+0x4c/0x80 [ 35.181211]kasan_set_free_info+0x1f/0x40 [ 35.181942] ____kasan_slab_free+0x103/0x140[ 35.182703] kfree+0xe3/0x250 [ 35.183239] igbvf_probe+0x1173/0x1a10[igbvf] [ 35.184040] local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47589` to fix the vulnerability.
