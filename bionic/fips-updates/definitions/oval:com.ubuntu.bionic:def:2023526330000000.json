		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: um:time-travel: fix time corruption In 'basic' time-travel mode (without=inf-cpu or =ext), we still get timer interrupts. These can happen atarbitrary points in time, i.e. while in timer_read(), which pushes timeforward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get the interrupt aftercalculating the new time to push to, but before actually finishing that,the interrupt will set the time to a value that's incompatible with theforward, and we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do theforwarding. Fix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating theadjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts disabled.",
