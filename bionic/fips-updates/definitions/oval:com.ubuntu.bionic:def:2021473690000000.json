		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/qeth: fix NULL deref in qeth_clear_working_pool_list() Whenqeth_set_online() calls qeth_clear_working_pool_list() to roll back afteran error exit from qeth_hardsetup_card(), we are at risk of accessingcard->qdio.in_q before it was allocated by qeth_alloc_qdio_queues() viaqeth_mpc_initialize(). qeth_clear_working_pool_list() then dereferencesNULL, and by writing to queue->bufs[i].pool_entry scribbles all over theCPU's lowcore. Resulting in a crash when those lowcore areas are used next(eg. on the next machine-check interrupt). Such a scenario would typicallyhappen when the device is first set online and its queues aren't allocatedyet. An early IO error or certain misconfigs (eg. mismatched transportmode, bad portno) then cause us to error out from qeth_hardsetup_card()with card->qdio.in_q still being NULL. Fix it by checking the pointer forNULL before accessing it. Note that we also have (rare) paths insideqeth_mpc_initialize() where a configuration change can cause us to free theexisting queues, expecting that subsequent code will allocate them again.If we then error out before that re-allocation happens, the same bugoccurs.
