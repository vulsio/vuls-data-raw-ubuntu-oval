		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent accessIn dasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue arecounted. The access to the device queue is unprotected againstconcurrent access. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with aliasdevices enabled, the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start()is accessing the queue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panicdue to incorrect pointer accesses.Fix this by taking the device lock before accessing the queue andcounting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profile datapointer can be done earlier to avoid unnecessary locking in a hot path.",
