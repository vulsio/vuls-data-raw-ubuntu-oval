		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls:fix NULL deref on tls_sw_splice_eof() with empty record syzkallerdiscovered that if tls_sw_splice_eof() is executed as part of sendfile()when the plaintext/ciphertext sk_msg are empty, the send path gets confusedbecause the empty ciphertext buffer does not have enough space for theencryption overhead. This causes tls_push_record() to go on the `split =true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting with anattached BPF program), and then get further confused and hit thetls_merge_open_record() path, which then assumes that there must be atleast one populated buffer element, leading to a NULL deref. It is possibleto have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously bailed fromtls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path.tls_sw_push_pending_record() already handles this case correctly; let's dothe same check in tls_sw_splice_eof().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52767` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1119-fips - 4.15.0-1119.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2103-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2103.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2082-azure-fips - 4.15.0-2082.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2066-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2066.71\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
