		"description": "GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implementsNTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, multiple out-of-bounds readswhen decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integeroverflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length ofinternal buffers. Although most applications will error out beforeaccepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoreticallyhappen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main`gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokensgreater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large, up to 65KB,out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads fromunmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-boundsreads.",
