		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 guest OS usersto cause a denial of service (infinite loop) because certain bit iterationis mishandled. In a number of places bitmaps are being used by thehypervisor to track certain state. Iteration over all bits involvesfunctions which may misbehave in certain corner cases: On x86 accesses tobitmaps with a compile time known size of 64 may incur undefined behavior,which may in particular result in infinite loops. A malicious guest maycause a hypervisor crash or hang, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).All versions of Xen are vulnerable. x86 systems with 64 or more nodes arevulnerable (there might not be any such systems that Xen would run on). x86systems with less than 64 nodes are not vulnerable.",
