Furthermore,interrupts are reenabled in the context of (B), and (C) fires withNMI priority. We end-up with a nested NMI situation, somethingwe definitely do not want to (and cannot) handle.The bug here is that spurious interrupts should never result in anystate change, and we should just return to the interrupted context.Moving the handling of spurious interrupts as early as possible inthe GICv3 handler fixes this issue.[maz: rewrote commit message, corrected Fixes: tag]",
