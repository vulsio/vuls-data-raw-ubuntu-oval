		"Title": "CVE-2023-46733 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set ofreusable PHP components. Starting in versions 5.4.21 and 6.2.7 and prior toversions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, `SessionStrategyListener` does not migrate thesession after every successful login. It does so only in case the logged inuser changes by means of checking the user identifier. In some use cases,the user identifier doesn't change between the verification phase and thesuccessful login, while the token itself changes from one type(partially-authenticated) to another (fully-authenticated). When thishappens, the session id should be regenerated to prevent possible sessionfixations, which is not the case at the moment. As of versions 5.4.31 and6.3.8, Symfony now checks the type of the token in addition to the useridentifier before deciding whether the session id should be regenerated.",
