		"description": "CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexibleway to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The\"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutationoption(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can beexecuted as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrustedinputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This isfixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.",
