		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ethernet: hisilicon: hns: hns_dsaf_misc: fix a possible array overflow inhns_dsaf_ge_srst_by_port() The if statement: if (port >= DSAF_GE_NUM)return; limits the value of port less than DSAF_GE_NUM (i.e., 8). However,if the value of port is 6 or 7, an array overflow could occur: port_rst_off= dsaf_dev->mac_cb[port]->port_rst_off; because the length ofdsaf_dev->mac_cb is DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM (i.e., 6). To fix this possible arrayoverflow, we first check port and if it is greater than or equal toDSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM, the function returns.",
