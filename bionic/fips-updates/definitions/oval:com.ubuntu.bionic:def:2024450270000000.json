		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: xhci: Check for xhci->interrupters being allocated inxhci_mem_clearup()If xhci_mem_init() fails, it calls into xhci_mem_cleanup() to mopup the damage. If it fails early enough, before xhci->interruptersis allocated but after xhci->max_interrupters has been set, whichhappens in most (all?) cases, things get uglier, as xhci_mem_cleanup()unconditionally derefences xhci->interrupters. With prejudice.Gate the interrupt freeing loop with a check on xhci->interruptersbeing non-NULL.Found while debugging a DMA allocation issue that led the XHCI driveron this exact path.",
