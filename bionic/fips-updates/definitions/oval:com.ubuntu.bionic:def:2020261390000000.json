		"description": "An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP)forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yetsuccessfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projectedWi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connectedclients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connectedclients.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26139` to fix the vulnerability.
