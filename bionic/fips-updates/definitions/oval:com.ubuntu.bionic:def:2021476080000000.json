		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Fix kernel address leakage in atomic fetch The change in commit37086bfdc737 (\"bpf: Propagate stack bounds to registers in atomics w/BPF_FETCH\") around check_mem_access() handling is buggy since this wouldallow for unprivileged users to leak kernel pointers. For example, anatomic fetch/and with -1 on a stack destination which holds a spilledpointer will migrate the spilled register type into a scalar, which canthen be exported out of the program (since scalar != pointer) by dumping itinto a map value. The original implementation of XADD was preventing thissituation by using a double call to check_mem_access() one with BPF_READand a subsequent one with BPF_WRITE, in both cases passing -1 as aplaceholder value instead of register as per XADD semantics since it didn'tcontain a value fetch. The BPF_READ also included a check incheck_stack_read_fixed_off() which rejects the program if the stack slot isof __is_pointer_value() if dst_regno < 0. The latter is to distinguishwhether we're dealing with a regular stack spill/ fill or some arithmeticaloperation which is disallowed on non-scalars, see also 6e7e63cbb023 (\"bpf:Forbid XADD on spilled pointers for unprivileged users\") for more contexton check_mem_access() and its handling of placeholder value -1. Oneminimally intrusive option to fix the leak is for the BPF_FETCH case toinitially check the BPF_READ case via check_mem_access() with -1 asregister, followed by the actual load case with non-negative load_reg topropagate stack bounds to registers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47608` to fix the vulnerability.
