		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fpga:bridge: add owner module and take its refcount The current implementationof the fpga bridge assumes that the low-level module registers a driver forthe parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module's refcount.This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointerdereference while attempting to get the bridge if the parent device doesnot have a driver. To address this problem, add a module owner pointer tothe fpga_bridge struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify thefunction for registering a bridge to take an additional owner moduleparameter and rename it to avoid conflicts. Use the old function name for ahelper macro that automatically sets the module that registers the bridgeas the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level controlmodules and reduces the chances of registering a bridge without setting theowner. Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the newinterface for registering an fpga bridge. Other changes: opportunisticallymove put_device() from __fpga_bridge_get() to fpga_bridge_get() andof_fpga_bridge_get() to improve code clarity since the bridge device istaken in these functions.",
