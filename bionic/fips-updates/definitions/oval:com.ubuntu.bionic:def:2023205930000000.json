    "Description": "An issue in “Zen 2” CPUs, under specific microarchitectural circumstances, may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information. Tavis Ormandy discovered that some AMD processors did not properly handle speculative execution of certain vector register instructions. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",

    "Note": "alexmurray> In Ubuntu the linux-firmware source package does not ship the AMD microcode - instead this is contained within the amd64-microcode source package. There is also an associated patch for the Linux kernel to add a new chicken-bit which will automatically be set to enable a fallback workaround in the kernel in the case that the associated microcode is not available. Finally, the updates released by AMD on 2023-07-24 only cover Rome / Castle Peak and Mendocino designs - updates for consumer oriented designs like Matisse, Renoir etc are expected later in the year. This is not planned to be fixed for the amd64-microcode package in Ubuntu 14.04 as that release was already outside of the LTS timeframe when this hardware platform was launched."
