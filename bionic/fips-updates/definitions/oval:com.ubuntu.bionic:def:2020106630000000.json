    "Title": "CVE-2020-10663 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10663` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.8\nruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.8\nNo subscription required",
