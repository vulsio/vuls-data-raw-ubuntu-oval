		"description": "eventlet before 0.35.2, as used in dnspython before 2.6.0, allows remoteattackers to interfere with DNS name resolution by quickly sending aninvalid packet from the expected IP address and source port, aka a \"TuDoor\"attack. In other words, dnspython does not have the preferred behavior inwhich the DNS name resolution algorithm would proceed, within the full timewindow, in order to wait for a valid packet. NOTE: dnspython 2.6.0 isunusable for a different reason that was addressed in 2.6.1.",
