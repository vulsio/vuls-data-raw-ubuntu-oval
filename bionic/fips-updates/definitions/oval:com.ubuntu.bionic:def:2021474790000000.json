		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:staging: rtl8712: fix use-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw Syzbot reporteduse-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw(). The problem was in race conditionbetween r871xu_dev_remove() ->ndo_open() callback. It's easy to see fromcrash log, that driver accesses released firmware in ->ndo_open() callback.It may happen, since driver was releasing firmware _before_ unregisteringnetdev. Fix it by moving unregister_netdev() before cleaning up resources.Call Trace: ... rtl871x_open_fw drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:83[inline] rtl8712_dl_fw+0xd95/0xe10 drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:170rtl8712_hal_init drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:330 [inline]rtl871x_hal_init+0xae/0x180 drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:394netdev_open+0xe6/0x6c0 drivers/staging/rtl8712/os_intfs.c:380__dev_open+0x2bc/0x4d0 net/core/dev.c:1484 Freed by task 1306: ...release_firmware+0x1b/0x30 drivers/base/firmware_loader/main.c:1053r871xu_dev_remove+0xcc/0x2c0 drivers/staging/rtl8712/usb_intf.c:599usb_unbind_interface+0x1d8/0x8d0 drivers/usb/core/driver.c:458",
