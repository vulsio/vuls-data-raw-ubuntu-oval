		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/i915/gem: Fix Virtual Memory mapping boundaries calculationCalculating the size of the mapped area as the lesser valuebetween the requested size and the actual size does not considerthe partial mapping offset. This can cause page fault access.Fix the calculation of the starting and ending addresses, thetotal size is now deduced from the difference between the end andstart addresses.Additionally, the calculations have been rewritten in a clearerand more understandable form.[Joonas: Add Requires: tag]Requires: 60a2066c5005 (\"drm/i915/gem: Adjust vma offset for framebuffermmap offset\")(cherry picked from commit 97b6784753da06d9d40232328efc5c5367e53417)",
