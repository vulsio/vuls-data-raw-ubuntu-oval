    "Title": "CVE-2021-3609 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": ".A flaw was found in the CAN BCM networking protocol in the Linux kernel, where a local attacker can abuse a flaw in the CAN subsystem to corrupt memory, crash the system or escalate privileges. This race condition in net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel allows for local privilege escalation to root. Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3609` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-generic - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-lowlatency - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-147-generic - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-147-lowlatency - 4.15.0-147.151\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1106-aws - 4.15.0-1106.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1051-aws - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1118-azure - 4.15.0-1118.131\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-azure - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-dell300x - 4.15.0-1022.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1103-gcp - 4.15.0-1103.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gcp - 5.4.0-1046.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1044-gke - 5.3.0-1044.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-75-generic - 5.3.0-75.71\nlinux-image-5.3.0-75-lowlatency - 5.3.0-75.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-75-generic - 5.3.0-75.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-75-lowlatency - 5.3.0-75.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1094-kvm - 4.15.0-1094.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1075-oracle - 4.15.0-1075.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-oracle - 5.4.0-1048.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-raspi - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1089-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1089.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1041-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1041.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-generic - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-4.15.0-147-lowlatency - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-147-generic - 4.15.0-147.151\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-147-lowlatency - 4.15.0-147.151\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1106-aws - 4.15.0-1106.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1051-aws - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1118-azure - 4.15.0-1118.131\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-azure - 5.4.0-1051.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-dell300x - 4.15.0-1022.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1103-gcp - 4.15.0-1103.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gcp - 5.4.0-1046.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1044-gke - 5.3.0-1044.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-75-generic - 5.3.0-75.71\nlinux-image-5.3.0-75-lowlatency - 5.3.0-75.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-75-generic - 5.3.0-75.71\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-75-lowlatency - 5.3.0-75.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-generic - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-77-lowlatency - 5.4.0-77.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1075-oracle - 4.15.0-1075.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-oracle - 5.4.0-1048.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1106-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1106.115\nNo subscription required",
