    "Title": "CVE-2021-3732 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's OverlayFS subsystem in the way the user mounts the TmpFS filesystem with OverlayFS. This flaw allows a local user to gain access to hidden files that should not be accessible. Alois Wohlschlager discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux kernel did not restrict private clones in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3732` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-lowlatency - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-lowlatency - 4.15.0-159.167\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-aws - 4.15.0-1112.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1058-aws - 5.4.0-1058.61~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-azure - 5.4.0-1062.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1028-dell300x - 4.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-gcp - 4.15.0-1109.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gcp - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-gke - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gkeop - 5.4.0-1025.26~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1100-kvm - 4.15.0-1100.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-oracle - 4.15.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-oracle - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1045-raspi - 5.4.0-1045.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1096-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1096.102\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-4.15.0-159-lowlatency - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-generic - 4.15.0-159.167\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-159-lowlatency - 4.15.0-159.167\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-aws - 4.15.0-1112.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1058-aws - 5.4.0-1058.61~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1062-azure - 5.4.0-1062.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1028-dell300x - 4.15.0-1028.33\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-gcp - 4.15.0-1109.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gcp - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-gke - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gkeop - 5.4.0-1025.26~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-generic - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-89-lowlatency - 5.4.0-89.100~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-oracle - 4.15.0-1081.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-oracle - 5.4.0-1056.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1113-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1113.122\nNo subscription required",
