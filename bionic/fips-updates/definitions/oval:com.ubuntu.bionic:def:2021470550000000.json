		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mtd:require write permissions for locking and badblock ioctls MEMLOCK,MEMUNLOCK and OTPLOCK modify protection bits. Thus require writepermission. Depending on the hardware MEMLOCK might even be write-once,e.g. for SPI-NOR flashes with their WP# tied to GND. OTPLOCK is alwayswrite-once. MEMSETBADBLOCK modifies the bad block table.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47055` to fix the vulnerability.
