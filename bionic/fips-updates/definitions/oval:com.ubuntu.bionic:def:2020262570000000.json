		"description": "Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP.Synapse is a reference \"homeserver\" implementation of Matrix. A maliciousor poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room byspecifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`,`/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. Thiscan lead to a denial of service in which future events will not becorrectly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any serverwhich accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. The MatrixSynapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementationis vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1.As a workaround homeserver administrators could limit access to thefederation API to trusted servers (for example via`federation_domain_whitelist`).",
