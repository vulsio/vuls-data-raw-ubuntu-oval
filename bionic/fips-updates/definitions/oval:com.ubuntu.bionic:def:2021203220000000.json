		"description": "A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed andICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow theability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remoteuser to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highestthreat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possiblyintegrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomizationare indirectly affected as well.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-20322` to fix the vulnerability.
