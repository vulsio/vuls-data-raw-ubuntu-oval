		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: fix out-of-bounds access in ops_initnet_alloc_generic is called by net_alloc, which is called without anylocking. It reads max_gen_ptrs, which is changed under pernet_ops_rwsem. Itis read twice, first to allocate an array, then to set s.len, which islater used to limit the bounds of the array access.It is possible that the array is allocated and another thread isregistering a new pernet ops, increments max_gen_ptrs, which is then usedto set s.len with a larger than allocated length for the variable array.Fix it by reading max_gen_ptrs only once in net_alloc_generic. Ifmax_gen_ptrs is later incremented, it will be caught in net_assign_generic.",
