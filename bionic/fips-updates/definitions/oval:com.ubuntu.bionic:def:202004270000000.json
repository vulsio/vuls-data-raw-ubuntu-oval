		"Description": "In create_pinctrl of core.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-140550171 Elena Petrova discovered that the pin controller device tree implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle string references. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-0427` to fix the vulnerability.
