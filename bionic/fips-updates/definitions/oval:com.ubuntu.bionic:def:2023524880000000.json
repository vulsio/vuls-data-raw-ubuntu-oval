		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: serial:sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO TheSC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the initialregister address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data withouthaving to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the ICdoesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte. Theregmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can perform IOover multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write from/to theFIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on the SPIbus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled manually.The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these functionsassume that the register address is incremented and handle the cacheaccordingly. Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versionsin order to remove the manual cache control which was a workaround whenusing the _raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatileso cache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.",
