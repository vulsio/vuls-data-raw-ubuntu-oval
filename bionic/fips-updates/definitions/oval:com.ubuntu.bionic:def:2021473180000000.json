		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arch_topology: Avoid use-after-free for scale_freq_dataCurrently topology_scale_freq_tick() (which gets called fromscheduler_tick()) may end up using a pointer to \"structscale_freq_data\", which was previously cleared bytopology_clear_scale_freq_source(), as there is no protection in placehere. The users of topology_clear_scale_freq_source() though needs aguarantee that the previously cleared scale_freq_data isn't usedanymore, so they can free the related resources.Since topology_scale_freq_tick() is called from scheduler tick, we don'twant to add locking in there. Use the RCU update mechanism instead(which is already used by the scheduler's utilization update path) toguarantee race free updates here.synchronize_rcu() makes sure that all RCU critical sections that startedbefore it is called, will finish before it returns. And so the callersof topology_clear_scale_freq_source() don't need to worry about theircallback getting called anymore.",
