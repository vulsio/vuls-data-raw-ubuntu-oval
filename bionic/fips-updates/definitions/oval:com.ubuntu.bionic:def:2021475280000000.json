		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:cdnsp: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in cdnsp_endpoint_init() Incdnsp_endpoint_init(), cdnsp_ring_alloc() is assigned to pep->ring andthere is a dereference of it in cdnsp_endpoint_init(), which could lead toa NULL pointer dereference on failure of cdnsp_ring_alloc(). Fix this bugby adding a check of pep->ring. This bug was found by a static analyzer.The analysis employs differential checking to identify inconsistentsecurity operations (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths andconfirms that the inconsistent operations are not recovered in the currentfunction or the callers, so they constitute bugs. Note that, as a bug foundby static analysis, it can be a false positive or hard to trigger. Multipleresearchers have cross-reviewed the bug. Builds withCONFIG_USB_CDNSP_GADGET=y show no new warnings, and our static analyzer nolonger warns about this code.",
