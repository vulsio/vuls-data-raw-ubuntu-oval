		"description": "The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to facilitate andstandardize the distribution of content. In the OCI DistributionSpecification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone wasused to determine the type of document during push and pull operations.Documents that contain both “manifests” and “layers” fields could beinterpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of anaccompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed betweentwo pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting contentdifferently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to requirethat a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match theContent-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clientspulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject anambiguous document that contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or“manifests” and “config” fields if they are unable to update to version1.0.1 of the spec.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-41190` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncontainerd - 1.5.9-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
