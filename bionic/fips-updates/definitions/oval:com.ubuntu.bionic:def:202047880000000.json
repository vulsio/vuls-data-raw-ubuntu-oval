		"Title": "CVE-2020-4788 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "IBM Power9 (AIX 7.1, 7.2, and VIOS 3.1) processors could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. IBM X-Force ID: 189296. It was discovered that Power 9 processors could be coerced to expose information from the L1 cache in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-4788` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-126-generic - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-4.15.0-126-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-4.15.0-126-lowlatency - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-126-generic - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-126-lowlatency - 4.15.0-126.129\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1032-aws - 5.4.0-1032.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-azure - 5.4.0-1034.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1009-dell300x - 4.15.0-1009.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-gcp - 5.4.0-1032.34~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-gke - 5.4.0-1032.34~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-gkeop - 5.4.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-56-generic - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-56-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-56-lowlatency - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-56-generic - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-56-lowlatency - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-oracle - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-126-generic - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-4.15.0-126-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-4.15.0-126-lowlatency - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-126-generic - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-126-lowlatency - 4.15.0-126.129\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1032-aws - 5.4.0-1032.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-azure - 5.4.0-1034.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1009-dell300x - 4.15.0-1009.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-gcp - 5.4.0-1032.34~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1032-gke - 5.4.0-1032.34~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1007-gkeop - 5.4.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-56-generic - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-56-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-56-lowlatency - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-56-generic - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-56-lowlatency - 5.4.0-56.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-oracle - 5.4.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required",
