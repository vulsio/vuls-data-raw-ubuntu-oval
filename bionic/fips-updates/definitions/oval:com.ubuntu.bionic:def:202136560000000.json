		"title": "CVE-2021-3656 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS-updates 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nestedvirtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machinecontrol block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest(L2). Due to improper validation of the \"virt_ext\" field, this issue couldallow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS(Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest wouldbe allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crashof the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-hostescape.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3656` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic - 5.4.0-84.94~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-84.94~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-84-lowlatency - 5.4.0-84.94~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-84-generic - 5.4.0-84.94~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-84-lowlatency - 5.4.0-84.94~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-kvm - 4.15.0-1099.101\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1056-aws - 5.4.0-1056.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-azure - 5.4.0-1058.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gcp - 5.4.0-1052.56~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-gke - 5.4.0-1052.55~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-gkeop - 5.4.0-1023.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-oracle - 5.4.0-1054.58~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1112.121\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
