		"title": "CVE-2021-3656 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - high",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nestedvirtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machinecontrol block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest(L2). Due to improper validation of the \"virt_ext\" field, this issue couldallow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS(Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest wouldbe allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crashof the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-hostescape.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3656` to fix the vulnerability.
