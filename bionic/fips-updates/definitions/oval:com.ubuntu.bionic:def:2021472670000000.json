		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:fix various gadget panics on 10gbps cabling usb_assign_descriptors() iscalled with 5 parameters, the last 4 of which are the usb_descriptor_headerfor: full-speed (USB1.1 - 12Mbps [including USB1.0 low-speed @ 1.5Mbps),high-speed (USB2.0 - 480Mbps), super-speed (USB3.0 - 5Gbps),super-speed-plus (USB3.1 - 10Gbps). The differences betweenfull/high/super-speed descriptors are usually substantial (due to changesin the maximum usb block size from 64 to 512 to 1024 bytes and otherdifferences in the specs), while the difference between 5 and 10Gbpsdescriptors may be as little as nothing (in many cases the same tuning issimply good enough). However if a gadget driver callsusb_assign_descriptors() with a NULL descriptor for super-speed-plus and isthen used on a max 10gbps configuration, the kernel will crash with a nullpointer dereference, when a 10gbps capable device port + cable + host portcombination shows up. (This wouldn't happen if the gadget max-speed was setto 5gbps, but it of course defaults to the maximum, and there's no realreason to artificially limit it) The fix is to simply use the 5gbpsdescriptor as the 10gbps descriptor, if a 10gbps descriptor wasn'tprovided. Obviously this won't fix the problem if the 5gbps descriptor isalso NULL, but such cases can't be so trivially solved (and any suchgadgets are unlikely to be used with USB3 ports any way).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47267` to fix the vulnerability.
