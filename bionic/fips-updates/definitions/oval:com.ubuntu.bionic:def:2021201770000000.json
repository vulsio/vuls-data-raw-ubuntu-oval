    "Title": "CVE-2021-20177 on Ubuntu 18.04 FIPS Compliant (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of string matching within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) when inserting iptables rules could insert a rule which can panic the system. Kernel before kernel 5.5-rc1 is affected. It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle filter rules in some situations. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-20177` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-aws - 5.4.0-1038.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-azure - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gcp - 5.4.0-1037.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-gke - 4.15.0-1030.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-gke - 5.4.0-1036.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-gkeop - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-oracle - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1029-raspi - 5.4.0-1029.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1038-aws - 5.4.0-1038.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-azure - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gcp - 5.4.0-1037.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-gke - 4.15.0-1030.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-gke - 5.4.0-1036.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-gkeop - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-generic - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-66-lowlatency - 5.4.0-66.74~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-oracle - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required",
