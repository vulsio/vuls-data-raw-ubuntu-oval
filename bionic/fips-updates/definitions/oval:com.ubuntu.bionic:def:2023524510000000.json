		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem arraydlpar_memory_remove_by_index() may access beyond the bounds of thedrmem lmb array when the LMB lookup fails to match an entry with thegiven DRC index. When the search fails, the cursor is left pointing to&drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs], which is one element past thelast valid entry in the array.
