		"description": "This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a runningprogram using libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met.libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates \"easyhandles\" that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurlprovides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called[curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).If a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, thecookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actualcookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific fileon disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file nameas `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes). Subsequent use of thecloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies fromwould then inadvertently load cookies from a file named `none` - if such afile exists and is readable in the current directory of the program usinglibcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38546` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm2\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm2\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm2\nlibcurl4 - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
