		"description": "Late privilege drop in REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY in PostgreSQLallows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the commandissuer. The command intends to run SQL functions as the owner of thematerialized view, enabling safe refresh of untrusted materialized views.The victim is a superuser or member of one of the attacker's roles. Theattack requires luring the victim into running REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEWCONCURRENTLY on the attacker's materialized view. As part of exploitingthis vulnerability, the attacker creates functions that use CREATE RULE toconvert the internally-built temporary table to a view. Versions beforePostgreSQL 15.6, 14.11, 13.14, and 12.18 are affected. The only knownexploit does not work in PostgreSQL 16 and later. For defense in depth,PostgreSQL 16.2 adds the protections that older branches are using to fixtheir vulnerability.",
