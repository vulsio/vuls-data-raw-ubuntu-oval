		"description": "The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks bycalling path.resolve() on any paths given by the user. If the path is to betreated as a Buffer, the implementation uses Buffer.from() to obtain aBuffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching Bufferinternals, namely, Buffer.prototype.utf8Write, the application can modifythe result of path.resolve(), which leads to a path traversalvulnerability.This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permissionmodel in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21.Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model isan experimental feature of Node.js.",
