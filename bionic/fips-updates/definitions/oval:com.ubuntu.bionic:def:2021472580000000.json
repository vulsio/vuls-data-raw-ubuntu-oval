		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc() After device is initializedvia device_initialize(), or its name is set via dev_set_name(), the devicehas to be freed via put_device(). Otherwise device name will be leakedbecause it is allocated dynamically in dev_set_name(). Fix the leak byreplacing kfree() with put_device(). Since scsi_host_dev_release() properlyhandles IDA and kthread removal, remove special-casing these from the errorhandling as well.",
