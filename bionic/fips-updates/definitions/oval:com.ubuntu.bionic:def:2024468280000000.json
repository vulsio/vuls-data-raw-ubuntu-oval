		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairnessIn sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,when running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as theround-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of activebulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.This has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when ahash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state ofthe hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,and if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-hoststate to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of thehost(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state isassigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same hostanymore, are incremented again).Back when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was alwaysenabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configurationflags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, butthe *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spuriousdecrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).AFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-aroundhappens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common initself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases thisis harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode isenabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to firstbe configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in thismode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, theqdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to thearray out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained andused as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,which is quite impressive in its own right.This patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check ondecrement as is used on increment.The original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listedin the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't applybefore that.",
