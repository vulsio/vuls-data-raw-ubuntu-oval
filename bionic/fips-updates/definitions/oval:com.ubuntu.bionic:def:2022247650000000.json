		"description": "Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. Thisvulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrustedparties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted partiescould create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Gitoperations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Gitdirectory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. GitBash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Userswho installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Usersof IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new projectwould already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`.Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a GitBash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unableto upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commandsare run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround.Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the_parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profileis located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24765` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngit - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-all - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-cvs - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-daemon-run - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-daemon-sysvinit - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-el - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-email - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-gui - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-man - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-mediawiki - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-svn - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngitk - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngitweb - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\nNo subscription required",
