		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:x86/mmu: x86: Don't overflow lpage_info when checking attributes FixKVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES to not overflow lpage_info array and triggerKASAN splat, as seen in the private_mem_conversions_test selftest. Whenmemory attributes are set on a GFN range, that range will have specificproperties applied to the TDP. A huge page cannot be used when theattributes are inconsistent, so they are disabled for those the specifichuge pages. For internal KVM reasons, huge pages are also not allowed tospan adjacent memslots regardless of whether the backing memory could bemapped as huge. What GFNs support which huge page sizes is tracked by anarray of arrays 'lpage_info' on the memslot, of ‘kvm_lpage_info’ structs.Each index of lpage_info contains a vmalloc allocated array of these for aspecific supported page size. The kvm_lpage_info denotes whether a specifichuge page (GFN and page size) on the memslot is supported. These arraysinclude indices for unaligned head and tail huge pages. Preventing hugepages from spanning adjacent memslot is covered by incrementing the countin head and tail kvm_lpage_info when the memslot is allocated, butdisallowing huge pages for memory that has mixed attributes has to be donein a more complicated way. During the KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES ioctl KVMupdates lpage_info for each memslot in the range that has mismatchedattributes. KVM does this a memslot at a time, and marks a special bit,KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG, in the kvm_lpage_info for any huge page. This bit isessentially a permanently elevated count. So huge pages will not be mappedfor the GFN at that page size if the count is elevated in either case: ahuge head or tail page unaligned to the memslot or if KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAGis set because it has mixed attributes. To determine whether a huge pagehas consistent attributes, the KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES operation checksan xarray to make sure it consistently has the incoming attribute. Sincelevel - 1 huge pages are aligned to level huge pages, it employs anoptimization. As long as the level - 1 huge pages are checked first, it canjust check these and assume that if each level - 1 huge page containedwithin the level sized huge page is not mixed, then the level size hugepage is not mixed. This optimization happens in the helperhugepage_has_attrs(). Unfortunately, although the kvm_lpage_info arrayrepresenting page size 'level' will contain an entry for an unaligned tailpage of size level, the array for level - 1 will not contain an entry foreach GFN at page size level. The level - 1 array will only contain an indexfor any unaligned region covered by level - 1 huge page size, which can bea smaller region. So this causes the optimization to overflow the level - 1kvm_lpage_info and perform a vmalloc out of bounds read. In some cases ofhead and tail pages where an overflow could happen, callers skip theoperation completely as KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is not required to preventhuge pages as discussed earlier. But for memslots that are smaller than the1GB page size, it does call hugepage_has_attrs(). In this case the hugepage is both the head and tail page. The issue can be observed simply bycompiling the kernel with CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC and running the selftest“private_mem_conversions_test”, which produces the output like thefollowing: BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds inhugepage_has_attrs+0x7e/0x110 Read of size 4 at addr ffffc900000a3008 bytask private_mem_con/169 Call Trace: dump_stack_lvl print_report ?__virt_addr_valid ? hugepage_has_attrs ? hugepage_has_attrs kasan_report ?hugepage_has_attrs hugepage_has_attrs kvm_arch_post_set_memory_attributeskvm_vm_ioctl It is a little ambiguous whether the unaligned head page (inthe bug case also the tail page) should be expected to haveKVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG set.
