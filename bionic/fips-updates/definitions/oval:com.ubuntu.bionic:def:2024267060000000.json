		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:parisc: Fix random data corruption from exception handlerThe current exception handler implementation, which assists when accessinguser space memory, may exhibit random data corruption if the compilerdecidesto use a different register than the specified register %r29 (defined inASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG) for the error code. If the compiler choose anotherregister, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 andthustrash whatever this register is used for.Looking at the assembly I found that this happens sometimes inemulate_ldd().To solve the issue, the easiest solution would be if it somehow ispossible to tell the fault handler which register is used to hold the errorcode. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it willshowup as e.g. %r29 (with the \"%r\" prefix), which the GNU assembler can notconvert to an integer.This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach:We extend the __ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one32-word.In this word we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction\"or %r0,%r0,%reg\", where %reg references the register which the compilerchoosed for the error return code.In case of an access failure, the fault handler finds the __ex_table entryandcan examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the lowest 5 bits,andthe fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.Since we extend the __ex_table to 3 words we can't use theBUILDTIME_TABLE_SORTconfig option any longer.",
