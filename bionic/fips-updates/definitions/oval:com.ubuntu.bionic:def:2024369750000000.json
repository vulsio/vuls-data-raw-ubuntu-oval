		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KEYS: trusted: Do not use WARN when encode failsWhen asn1_encode_sequence() fails, WARN is not the correct solution.1. asn1_encode_sequence() is not an internal function (located   in lib/asn1_encode.c).2. Location is known, which makes the stack trace useless.3. Results a crash if panic_on_warn is set.It is also noteworthy that the use of WARN is undocumented, and itshould be avoided unless there is a carefully considered rationale touse it.Replace WARN with pr_err, and print the return value instead, which isonly useful piece of information.",
