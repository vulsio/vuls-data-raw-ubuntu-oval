		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tablescomponent can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Thenft_setelem_catchall_deactivate() function checks whether the catch-all setelement is active in the current generation instead of the next generationbefore freeing it, but only flags it inactive in the next generation,making it possible to free the element multiple times, leading to a doublefree vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commitb1db244ffd041a49ecc9618e8feb6b5c1afcdaa7.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-1085` to fix the vulnerability.
