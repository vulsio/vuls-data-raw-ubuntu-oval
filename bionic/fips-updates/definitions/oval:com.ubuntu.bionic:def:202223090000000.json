		"description": "NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (orapplication crash). This only applies when lxml is used together withlibxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected.It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerablecode sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by theiterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such codeshouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk wouldusually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, anXML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, forexample, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. Ifuntrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalkfunction, a crash can be triggered.",
