		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:core: Put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released SCSI host releaseis triggered when SCSI device is freed. We have to make sure that thelow-level device driver module won't be unloaded before SCSI host instanceis released because shost->hostt is required in the release handler. Makesure to put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released. Fixes a kernelpanic of 'BUG: unable to handle page fault for address' reported byChanghui and Yi.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47480` to fix the vulnerability.
