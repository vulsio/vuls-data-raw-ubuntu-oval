		"description": "A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel.The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on `structnet_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between thefree on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. Thiscould lead to a denial of service condition or potential code execution.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-6270` to fix the vulnerability.
