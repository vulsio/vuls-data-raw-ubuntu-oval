		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/sev: Fix position dependent variable references in startup code Theearly startup code executes from a 1:1 mapping of memory, which differsfrom the mapping that the code was linked and/or relocated to run at. Thelatter mapping is not active yet at this point, and so symbol referencesthat rely on it will fault. Given that the core kernel is built without-fPIC, symbol references are typically emitted as absolute, and so any suchreferences occuring in the early startup code will therefore crash thekernel. While an attempt was made to work around this for the early SEV/SMEstartup code, by forcing RIP-relative addressing for certain global SEV/SMEvariables via inline assembly (see snp_cpuid_get_table() for example),RIP-relative addressing must be pervasively enforced for SEV/SME globalvariables when accessed prior to page table fixups. __startup_64() alreadyhandles this issue for select non-SEV/SME global variables usingfixup_pointer(), which adjusts the pointer relative to a `physaddr`argument. To avoid having to pass around this `physaddr` argument acrossall functions needing to apply pointer fixups, introduce a macroRIP_RELATIVE_REF() which generates a RIP-relative reference to a givenglobal variable. It is used where necessary to force RIP-relative accessesto global variables. For backporting purposes, this patch makes no attemptat cleaning up other occurrences of this pattern, involving either inlineasm or fixup_pointer(). Those will be addressed later. [ bp: Call it\"rip_rel_ref\" everywhere like other code shortens \"rIP-relative reference\"and make the asm wrapper __always_inline. ]",
