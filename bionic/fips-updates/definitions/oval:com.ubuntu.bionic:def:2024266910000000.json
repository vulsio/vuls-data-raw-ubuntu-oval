		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: Fix circular locking dependency The rule inside kvm enforces thatthe vcpu->mutex is taken *inside* kvm->lock. The rule is violated by thepkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquires the kvm->lock while already holding thevcpu->mutex lock from kvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular lockingdependency altogether by protecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock,much like we already do for other forms of VM-scoped data.",
