		"description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14,and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due toinsufficient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to preventextraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relativepaths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achievedby stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths containedin a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into`home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths containedrepeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would onlystrip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file pathwith repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`)would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary filecreation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14,5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgradingby creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a`filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referencedGitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes asimilar bug in later versions of tar.",
