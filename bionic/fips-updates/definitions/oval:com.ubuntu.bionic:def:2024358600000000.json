		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:support deferring bpf_link dealloc to after RCU grace period BPF link forsome program types is passed as a \"context\" which can be used by those BPFprograms to look up additional information. E.g., for multi-kprobes andmulti-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values. Because of thisruntime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero there could still beactive BPF programs running accessing link data. This patch adds genericsupport to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to after RCU GP, if requested.This is done by exposing two different deallocation callbacks, onesynchronous and one deferred. If deferred one is provided, bpf_link_free()will schedule dealloc_deferred() callback to happen after RCU GP. BPF isusing two flavors of RCU: \"classic\" non-sleepable one and RCU tasks traceone. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are used.bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF program'ssleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only fornon-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP(taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPFprogram is sleepable. We use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links,which dereference link during program run. We also preventively switchraw_tp link to use deferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes inbpf-next tree expose raw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPFprogram at runtime as well.",
