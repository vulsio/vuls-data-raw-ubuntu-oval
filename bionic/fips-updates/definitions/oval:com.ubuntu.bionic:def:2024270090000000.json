		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing A race conditionexists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the online process tofail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent state. As a result,subsequent attempts to set that device online fail with return code ENODEV.The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after a waitfor final device state completed, but before the result state is evaluated.Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between determiningfinal state and checking result state. Note that since: commit 2297791c92d0(\"s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers\") pathverification requests are much more likely to occur during boot, resultingin an increased chance of this race condition occurring.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27009` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-hmac-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1027-fips - 4.15.0-1027.32\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2000-aws-fips - 4.15.0-2000.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-1002-azure-fips - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-2013-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2013.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-hmac-4.15.0-2013-gcp-fips - 4.15.0-2013.14\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
