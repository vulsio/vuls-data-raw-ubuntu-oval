		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bus: mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointerThough we do check the event ring read pointer by \"is_valid_ring_ptr\"to make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk thepointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elementsare 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointercould lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption.So add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.",
