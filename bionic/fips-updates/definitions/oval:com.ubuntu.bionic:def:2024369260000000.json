		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/pseries/iommu: LPAR panics during boot up with a frozen PE At thetime of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmware propertyibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCI bus the PEis attached to. There are execptions where the partition firmware might notprovide this property for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of thescenario is where the firmware has frozen the PE due to some errorcondition. This PE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system isreinitialized. Within this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PEwill be presented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing.Today, under these circumstances, the LPAR oopses with NULL pointerdereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.
