Here it trigger a 'Instruction page fault' exception (value at 'scause'   is '0xc'), if PF is not filled into PageTabe for that slot yet.4) Again kernel trap into page fault exception handler, where it choose   different policy according to the state of running kprobe. Because   afte 2) the state is KPROBE_HIT_SS, so kernel reset the current kp---truncated---",
