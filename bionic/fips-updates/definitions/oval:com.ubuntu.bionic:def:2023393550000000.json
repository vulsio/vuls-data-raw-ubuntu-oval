		"Description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),released under the Apache license. Versions of FreeRDP on the 3.x releasebranch before beta3 are subject to a Use-After-Free in processing`RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packets. If `context->maxPlaneSize` is 0,`context->planesBuffer` will be freed. However, without updating`context->planesBuffer`, this leads to a Use-After-Free exploit vector. Inmost environments this should only result in a crash. This issue has beenaddressed in version 3.0.0-beta3 and users of the beta 3.x releases areadvised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
