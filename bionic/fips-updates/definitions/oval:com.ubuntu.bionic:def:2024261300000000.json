Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior toversion 42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called withboth a certificate whose public key did not match the provided private keyand an `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via`PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`, then a NULLpointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has beenresolved in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` isproperly raised.",
