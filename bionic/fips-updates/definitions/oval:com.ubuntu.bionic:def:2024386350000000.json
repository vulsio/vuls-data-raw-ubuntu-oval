		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soundwire: cadence: fix invalid PDI offsetFor some reason, we add an offset to the PDI, presumably to skip thePDI0 and PDI1 which are reserved for BPT.This code is however completely wrong and leads to an out-of-boundsaccess. We were just lucky so far since we used only a couple of PDIsand remained within the PDI array bounds.A Fixes: tag is not provided since there are no known platforms wherethe out-of-bounds would be accessed, and the initial code had problemsas well.A follow-up patch completely removes this useless offset.",
