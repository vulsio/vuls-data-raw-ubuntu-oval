		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:fix double-free of blocks due to wrong extents moved_len Inext4_move_extents(), moved_len is only updated when all moves aresuccessfully executed, and only discards orig_inode and donor_inodepreallocations when moved_len is not zero. When the loop fails to exitafter successfully moving some extents, moved_len is not updated andremains at 0, so it does not discard the preallocations. If the movedextents overlap with the preallocated extents, the overlapped extents arefreed twice in ext4_mb_release_inode_pa() and ext4_process_freed_data() (asdescribed in commit 94d7c16cbbbd (\"ext4: Fix double-free of blocks withEXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT\")), and bb_free is incremented twice. Hence when trim isexecuted, a zero-division bug is triggered in mb_update_avg_fragment_size()because bb_free is not zero and bb_fragments is zero. Therefore, updatemove_len after each extent move to avoid the issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26704` to fix the vulnerability.
