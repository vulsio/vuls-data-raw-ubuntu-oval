		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tcp: donot accept ACK of bytes we never sent This patch is based on a detailedreport and ideas from Yepeng Pan and Christian Rossow. ACK seq validationis currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines: The ACK value is consideredacceptable only if it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <=SEG.ACK <= SND.NXT). All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfythe above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back. It needs to benoted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is aduplicate (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored. If the ACK acknowledgessomething not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send an ACK, drop thesegment, and return\". The \"ignored\" above implies that the processing ofthe incoming data segment continues, which means the ACK value is treatedas acceptable. This mitigation makes the ACK check more stringent since anyACK < SND.UNA wouldn't be accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <= SND.NXT) get through. This can berefined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows, by not accepting ACK forbytes that were never sent. This greatly improves TCP security at a littlecost. I added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,even if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC. tp->bytes_acked wasadded in linux-4.2 Following packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan)shows the issue at hand: 0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3 +0setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0 +0 bind(3, ..., ...) =0 +0 listen(3, 1024) = 0 // ---------------- Handshake -------------------// // when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to //65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440.
