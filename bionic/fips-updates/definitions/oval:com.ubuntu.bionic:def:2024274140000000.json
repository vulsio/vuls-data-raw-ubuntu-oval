		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: fix error logic of IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS writing backIn the commit d73ef2d69c0d (\"rtnetlink: let rtnl_bridge_setlink checksIFLA_BRIDGE_MODE length\"), an adjustment was made to the old loop logicin the function `rtnl_bridge_setlink` to enable the loop to also checkthe length of the IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE attribute. However, this adjustmentremoved the `break` statement and led to an error logic of the flagswriting back at the end of this function.if (have_flags)    memcpy(nla_data(attr), &flags, sizeof(flags));    // attr should point to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS NLA !!!Before the mentioned commit, the `attr` is granted to be IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS.However, this is not necessarily true fow now as the updated loop will letthe attr point to the last NLA, even an invalid NLA which could causeoverflow writes.This patch introduces a new variable `br_flag` to save the NLA pointerthat points to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS and uses it to resolve the mentionederror logic.",
