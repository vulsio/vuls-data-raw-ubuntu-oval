		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mmc: davinci: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtinUsing __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback beingdiscarded with CONFIG_MMC_DAVINCI=y. When such a device gets unbound (e.g.using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed without the cleanupbeing performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix it by compiling in theremove callback unconditionally.This also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:WARNING: modpost: drivers/mmc/host/davinci_mmc: section mismatch inreference: davinci_mmcsd_driver+0x10 (section: .data) ->davinci_mmcsd_remove (section: .exit.text)",
