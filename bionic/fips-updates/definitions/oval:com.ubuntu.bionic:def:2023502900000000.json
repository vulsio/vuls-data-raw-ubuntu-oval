		"description": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability inApache Solr. The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environmentvariables available to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specifywhich environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designedto work for known secret Java system properties. Environment variablescannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, andmay be set for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are setper-Java-proccess. The Solr Metrics API is protected by the \"metrics-read\"permission. Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only bevulnerable via users with the \"metrics-read\" permission. This issue affectsApache Solr: from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0. Users are recommended to upgrade toversion 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are not publishedvia the Metrics API.",
