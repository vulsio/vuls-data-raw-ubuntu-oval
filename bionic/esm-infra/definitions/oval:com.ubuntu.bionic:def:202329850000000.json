		"Title": "CVE-2023-2985 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use after free flaw was found in hfsplus_put_super in fs/hfsplus/super.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local user to cause a denial of service problem. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the HFS+ file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2985` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-216-generic - 4.15.0-216.227\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-216-generic - 4.15.0-216.227\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-216-lowlatency - 4.15.0-216.227\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1160-aws - 4.15.0-1160.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1169-azure - 4.15.0-1169.184\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1154-gcp - 4.15.0-1154.171\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1144-kvm - 4.15.0-1144.149\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1088.99~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-216-generic - 4.15.0-216.227\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-216-generic - 4.15.0-216.227\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-216-lowlatency - 4.15.0-216.227\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1160-aws - 4.15.0-1160.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1169-azure - 4.15.0-1169.184\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1154-gcp - 4.15.0-1154.171\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
