		"Title": "CVE-2019-19462 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "relay_open in kernel/relay.c in the Linux kernel through 5.4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (such as relay blockage) by triggering a NULL alloc_percpu result. It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check return values in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19462` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-lowlatency -
