    "Title": "CVE-2023-4459 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in the networking sub-component in vmxnet3 in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with normal user privilege to cause a denial of service due to a missing sanity check during cleanup. It was discovered that the VMware VMXNET3 ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle errors in certain situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4459` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1125-kvm - 4.15.0-1125.130\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1070-raspi - 5.4.0-1070.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
