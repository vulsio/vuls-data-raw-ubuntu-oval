    "Title": "CVE-2022-1016 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle 'return' with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker. David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1016` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1133-aws - 4.15.0-1133.143\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-gcp - 4.15.0-1127.142\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-kvm - 4.15.0-1119.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-oracle - 4.15.0-1098.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-raspi - 5.4.0-1060.68~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1114-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1114.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1133-aws - 4.15.0-1133.143\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-aws - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-azure - 5.4.0-1078.81~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-gcp - 4.15.0-1127.142\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-gcp - 5.4.0-1073.78~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-gke - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gkeop - 5.4.0-1040.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-generic - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-110-lowlatency - 5.4.0-110.124~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-ibm - 5.4.0-1021.23~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-oracle - 4.15.0-1098.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-oracle - 5.4.0-1071.77~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1132-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1132.142\nNo subscription required",
