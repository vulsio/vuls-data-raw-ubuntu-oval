		"Description": "When GNOME Dia before 2019-11-27 is launched with a filename argument thatis not a valid codepoint in the current encoding, it enters an endlessloop, thus endlessly writing text to stdout. If this launch is from athumbnailer service, this output will usually be written to disk via thesystem's logging facility (potentially with elevated privileges), thusfilling up the disk and eventually rendering the system unusable. (Thefilename can be for a nonexistent file.) NOTE: this does not affect anupstream release, but affects certain Linux distribution packages withversion numbers such as 0.97.3.",
