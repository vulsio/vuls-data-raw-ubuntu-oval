		"Title": "CVE-2023-45862 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/storage/ene_ub6250.c for the ENE UB6250 reader driver in the Linux kernel before 6.2.5. An object could potentially extend beyond the end of an allocation. It was discovered that the USB ENE card reader driver in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate enough memory when processing the storage device boot blocks. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-45862` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1088.99~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
