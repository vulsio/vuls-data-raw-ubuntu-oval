    "Title": "CVE-2016-9938 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 11.x before 11.25.1, 13.x before 13.13.1, and 14.x before 14.2.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert16 and 13.x before 13.8-cert4. The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as Contact\\x01: will be seen as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not affect you. If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect you. If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not affect you.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-9938` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nasterisk - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-config - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-dahdi - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-mobile - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-modules - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-mp3 - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-mysql - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-ooh323 - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-tests - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-voicemail - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-voicemail-imapstorage - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-voicemail-odbcstorage - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nasterisk-vpb - 1:13.13.1~dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
