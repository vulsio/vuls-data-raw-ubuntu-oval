A buffer overflow vulnerability in versions 2.13 and prior affectsapplications that use PJSIP DNS resolver. It doesn't affect PJSIP users whodo not utilise PJSIP DNS resolver. This vulnerability is related toCVE-2022-24793. The difference is that this issue is in parsing the queryrecord `parse_query()`, while the issue in CVE-2022-24793 is in`parse_rr()`. A patch is available as commit `d1c5e4d` in the `master`branch. A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (bysetting `nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external resolverimplementation instead.",
