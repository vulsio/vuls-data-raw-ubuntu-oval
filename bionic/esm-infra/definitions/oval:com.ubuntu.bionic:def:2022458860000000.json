		"Title": "CVE-2022-45886 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c has a .disconnect versus dvb_device_open race condition that leads to a use-after-free. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45886` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1093-raspi - 5.4.0-1093.104~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-aws - 5.4.0-1109.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-gcp - 5.4.0-1112.121~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-generic - 5.4.0-162.179~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-162-lowlatency - 5.4.0-162.179~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-oracle - 5.4.0-1108.117~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
