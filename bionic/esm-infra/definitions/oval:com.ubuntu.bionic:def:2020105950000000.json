		"Title": "CVE-2020-10595 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "pam-krb5 before 4.9 has a buffer overflow that might cause remote code execution in situations involving supplemental prompting by a Kerberos library. It may overflow a buffer provided by the underlying Kerberos library by a single '\\0' byte if an attacker responds to a prompt with an answer of a carefully chosen length. The effect may range from heap corruption to stack corruption depending on the structure of the underlying Kerberos library, with unknown effects but possibly including code execution. This code path is not used for normal authentication, but only when the Kerberos library does supplemental prompting, such as with PKINIT or when using the non-standard no_prompt PAM configuration option.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10595` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibpam-heimdal - 4.8-1ubuntu0.1\nlibpam-krb5 - 4.8-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
