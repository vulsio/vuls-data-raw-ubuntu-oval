		"description": "Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired pointer referencebug, Squid prior to version 6.6 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attackagainst Cache Manager error responses. This problem allows a trusted clientto perform Denial of Service when generating error pages for Client Managerreports. Squid older than 5.0.5 have not been tested and should be assumedto be vulnerable. All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 are vulnerable. AllSquid-6.x up to and including 6.5 are vulnerable. This bug is fixed bySquid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for thestable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. As a workaround,prevent access to Cache Manager using Squid's main access control:`http_access deny manager`.",
