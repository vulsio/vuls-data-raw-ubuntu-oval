		"Title": "CVE-2015-3416 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "The sqlite3VXPrintf function in printf.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly handle precision and width values during floating-point conversions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via large integers in a crafted printf function call in a SELECT statement.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-3416` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlemon - 3.8.10.2-1\nlibsqlite3-0 - 3.8.10.2-1\nlibsqlite3-tcl - 3.8.10.2-1\nsqlite3 - 3.8.10.2-1\nNo subscription required",
