    "Title": "CVE-2023-40283 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in l2cap_sock_release in net/bluetooth/l2cap_sock.c in the Linux kernel before 6.4.10. There is a use-after-free because the children of an sk are mishandled. It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle L2CAP socket release, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-40283` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-lowlatency - 4.15.0-218.229\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-aws - 4.15.0-1161.174\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-aws - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1116-azure - 5.4.0-1116.123~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-gcp - 4.15.0-1155.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-gcp - 5.4.0-1113.122~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-163-generic - 5.4.0-163.180~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-163-lowlatency - 5.4.0-163.180~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-ibm - 5.4.0-1057.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-kvm - 4.15.0-1145.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-oracle - 4.15.0-1124.135\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-oracle - 5.4.0-1109.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1094-raspi - 5.4.0-1094.105~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-lowlatency - 4.15.0-218.229\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-aws - 4.15.0-1161.174\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-aws - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1116-azure - 5.4.0-1116.123~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-gcp - 4.15.0-1155.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-gcp - 5.4.0-1113.122~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-163-generic - 5.4.0-163.180~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-163-lowlatency - 5.4.0-163.180~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-ibm - 5.4.0-1057.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-oracle - 4.15.0-1124.135\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-oracle - 5.4.0-1109.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
