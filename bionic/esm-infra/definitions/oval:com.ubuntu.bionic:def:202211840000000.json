		"Title": "CVE-2022-1184 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernelâ€™s filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1184` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1159.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-azure - 5.4.0-1113.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1153.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1143.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1091-raspi - 5.4.0-1091.102~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1159.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-azure - 5.4.0-1113.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1153.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
