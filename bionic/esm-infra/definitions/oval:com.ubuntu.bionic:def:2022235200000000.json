		"Description": "rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Railsapplications. Prior to version 1.4.4, there is a possible XSS vulnerabilitywith certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer due to an incompletefix of CVE-2022-32209. Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker toinject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer'sallowed tags to allow both \"select\" and \"style\" elements. Code is onlyimpacted if allowed tags are being overridden. This issue is patched inversion 1.4.4. All users overriding the allowed tags to include both\"select\" and \"style\" should either upgrade or use this workaround: Removeeither \"select\" or \"style\" from the overridden allowed tags. NOTE: Code is_not_ impacted if allowed tags are overridden using either the :tags optionto the Action View helper method sanitize or the :tags option to theinstance method SafeListSanitizer#sanitize.",
