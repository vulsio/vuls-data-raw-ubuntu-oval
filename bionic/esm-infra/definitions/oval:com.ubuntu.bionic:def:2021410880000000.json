		"Title": "CVE-2021-41088 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low",
		"Description": "Elvish is a programming language and interactive shell, combined into onepackage. In versions prior to 0.14.0 Elvish's web UI backend (started by`elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the code sent fromthe web UI. The backend does not check the origin of requests correctly. Asa result, if the user has the web UI backend open and visits a compromisedor malicious website, the website can send arbitrary code to the endpointin localhost. All Elvish releases from 0.14.0 onward no longer include thethe web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a versionfrom source that includes the web UI. The issue can be patched for previousversions by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web,depending on the exact version).",
