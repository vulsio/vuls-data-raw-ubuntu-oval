		"Title": "CVE-2023-31083 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. In hci_uart_tty_ioctl, there is a race condition between HCIUARTSETPROTO and HCIUARTGETPROTO. HCI_UART_PROTO_SET is set before hu->proto is set. A NULL pointer dereference may occur. Yu Hao and Weiteng Chen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI UART driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31083` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-lowlatency - 4.15.0-219.230\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-aws - 4.15.0-1162.175\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1113.123~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1119.126~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-gcp - 4.15.0-1156.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1117.126~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1060.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1146-kvm - 4.15.0-1146.151\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1112.121~18.04.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1086-raspi - 5.4.0-1097.109~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-lowlatency - 4.15.0-219.230\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-aws - 4.15.0-1162.175\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1113.123~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1119.126~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-gcp - 4.15.0-1156.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1117.126~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1060.65~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1112.121~18.04.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
