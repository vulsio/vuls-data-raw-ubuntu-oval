    "Title": "CVE-2020-0466 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "In do_epoll_ctl and ep_loop_check_proc of eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free due to a logic error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-147802478References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the eventpoll (aka epoll) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a logic error that could lead to a use after free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-0466` to fix the vulnerability.
