		"Title": "CVE-2020-10769 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before 5.0 incrypto_authenc_extractkeys in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec Cryptographicalgorithm's module, authenc. When a payload longer than 4 bytes, and is notfollowing 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes a bufferover-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a localattacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10769` to fix the vulnerability.
