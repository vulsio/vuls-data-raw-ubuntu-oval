    "Title": "CVE-2023-4244 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Due to a race condition between nf_tables netlink control plane transaction and nft_set element garbage collection, it is possible to underflow the reference counter causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 3e91b0ebd994635df2346353322ac51ce84ce6d8. Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
