		"Title": "CVE-2014-0119 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "Apache Tomcat before 6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.54, and 8.x before 8.0.6 does not properly constrain the class loader that accesses the XML parser used with an XSLT stylesheet, which allows remote attackers to (1) read arbitrary files via a crafted web application that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, or (2) read files associated with different web applications on a single Tomcat instance via a crafted web application. It was discovered that the Tomcat XML parser incorrectly handled XML External Entities (XXE). A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-0119` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibservlet3.0-java - 7.0.53-1\nNo subscription required\n\nlibtomcat8-embed-java - 8.0.9-1\nlibtomcat8-java - 8.0.9-1\ntomcat8 - 8.0.9-1\ntomcat8-admin - 8.0.9-1\ntomcat8-common - 8.0.9-1\ntomcat8-examples - 8.0.9-1\ntomcat8-user - 8.0.9-1\nNo subscription required",
