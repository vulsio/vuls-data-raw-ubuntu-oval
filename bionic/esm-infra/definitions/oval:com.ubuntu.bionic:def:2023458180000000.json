		"Title": "CVE-2023-45818 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting(mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s core undo and redofunctionality. When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes the XSSsanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal trimmingfunctions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML snippet isrestored from the undo stack, the combination of the string manipulationand reparative parsing by either the browser's native [DOMParserAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE 5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowingan XSS payload to be executed. This vulnerability has been patched inTinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring HTML is trimmed usingnode-level manipulation instead of string manipulation. Users are advisedto upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
