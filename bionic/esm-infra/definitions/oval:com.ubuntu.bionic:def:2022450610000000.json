		"Title": "CVE-2022-45061 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadraticalgorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presentedto the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are oftensupplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor;in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on theclient attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname.For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header ofan HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9,3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45061` to fix the vulnerability.
