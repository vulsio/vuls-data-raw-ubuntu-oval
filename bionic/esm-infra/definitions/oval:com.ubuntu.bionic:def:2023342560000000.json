		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.3.There is an out-of-bounds read in crc16 in lib/crc16.c when called fromfs/ext4/super.c because ext4_group_desc_csum does not properly check anoffset. NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because the kernel is notintended to defend against attackers with the stated \"When modifying theblock device while it is mounted by the filesystem\" access.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-34256` to fix the vulnerability.
