    "Title": "CVE-2021-38207 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/ll_temac_main.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and lockup) by sending heavy network traffic for about ten minutes. It was discovered that the Xilinx LL TEMAC device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate the number of buffers to be used in certain situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-38207` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1055-aws - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-azure - 5.4.0-1056.58~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gcp - 5.4.0-1051.55~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gke - 5.4.0-1051.54~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gkeop - 5.4.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-oracle - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1042-raspi - 5.4.0-1042.46~18.04.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1055-aws - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-azure - 5.4.0-1056.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gcp - 5.4.0-1051.55~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gke - 5.4.0-1051.54~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gkeop - 5.4.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-oracle - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required",
