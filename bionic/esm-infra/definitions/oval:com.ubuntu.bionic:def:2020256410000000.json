		"Title": "CVE-2020-25641 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs inversions before 5.9-rc7. A zero-length biovec request issued by the blocksubsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing adenial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with basic privilegesto issue requests to a block device, resulting in a denial of service. Thehighest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25641` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-126.129\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-126.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-51.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-51.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-51.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-51.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-51.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1079.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1088.93\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1028.29~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1100.111\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1031.32~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1088.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1028.29~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1074-gke - 4.15.0-1074.79\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1059.65\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1028.29~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1103-oem - 4.15.0-1103.114\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1074-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1074.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1021.24~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1091-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1091.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gke - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-gkeop - 5.4.0-1003.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-dell300x - 4.15.0-1007.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
