		"Title": "CVE-2019-19448 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21 and 5.3.11, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image, performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead to a use-after-free in try_merge_free_space in fs/btrfs/free-space-cache.c because the pointer to a left data structure can be the same as the pointer to a right data structure. It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when merging free space. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19448` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-121-generic - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-4.15.0-121-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-4.15.0-121-lowlatency - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-121-generic - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-121-lowlatency - 4.15.0-121.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1086-aws - 4.15.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1025-aws - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-azure - 4.15.0-1099.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-azure - 5.4.0-1026.26~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1086-gcp - 4.15.0-1086.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gcp - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1072-gke - 4.15.0-1072.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1077-kvm - 4.15.0-1077.79\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-oem - 4.15.0-1099.109\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-oracle - 4.15.0-1057.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-oracle - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-raspi - 5.4.0-1019.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1073-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-121-generic - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-4.15.0-121-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-4.15.0-121-lowlatency - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-121-generic - 4.15.0-121.123\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-121-lowlatency - 4.15.0-121.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1086-aws - 4.15.0-1086.91\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1025-aws - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-azure - 4.15.0-1099.110\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-azure - 5.4.0-1026.26~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1086-gcp - 4.15.0-1086.98\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gcp - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1072-gke - 4.15.0-1072.76\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-oem - 4.15.0-1099.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-oracle - 4.15.0-1057.62\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-oracle - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1089-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1089.98\nNo subscription required",
