		"Title": "CVE-2023-1859 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in xen_9pfs_front_removet in net/9p/trans_xen.c in Xen transport for 9pfs in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem, possibly leading to a kernel information leak. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer implementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1859` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1159.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1153.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1143.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1122.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1088.99~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1159.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1153.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1122.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
