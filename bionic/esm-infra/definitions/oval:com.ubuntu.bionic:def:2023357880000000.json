    "Title": "CVE-2023-35788 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation. Hangyu Hua discovered that the Flower classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-35788` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-aws - 5.4.0-1105.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-azure - 5.4.0-1111.117~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-gcp - 5.4.0-1108.117~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-generic - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-lowlatency - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-153-generic - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-153-lowlatency - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-ibm - 5.4.0-1052.57~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-oracle - 5.4.0-1104.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1089-raspi - 5.4.0-1089.100~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-aws - 5.4.0-1105.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-azure - 5.4.0-1111.117~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-gcp - 5.4.0-1108.117~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-generic - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-153-lowlatency - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-153-generic - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-153-lowlatency - 5.4.0-153.170~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-ibm - 5.4.0-1052.57~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-oracle - 5.4.0-1104.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
