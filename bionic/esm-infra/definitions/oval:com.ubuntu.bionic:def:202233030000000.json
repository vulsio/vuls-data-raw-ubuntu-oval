    "Title": "CVE-2022-3303 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race condition flaw was found in the Linux kernel sound subsystem due to improper locking. It could lead to a NULL pointer dereference while handling the SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC ioctl. A privileged local user (root or member of the audio group) could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service condition It was discovered that the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3303` to fix the vulnerability.
