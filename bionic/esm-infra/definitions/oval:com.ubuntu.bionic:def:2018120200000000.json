    "Title": "CVE-2018-12020 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "mainproc.c in GnuPG before 2.2.8 mishandles the original filename during decryption and verification actions, which allows remote attackers to spoof the output that GnuPG sends on file descriptor 2 to other programs that use the \"--status-fd 2\" option. For example, the OpenPGP data might represent an original filename that contains line feed characters in conjunction with GOODSIG or VALIDSIG status codes. Marcus Brinkmann discovered that GnuPG before 2.2.8 improperly handled certain command line parameters. A remote attacker could use this to spoof the output of GnuPG and cause unsigned e-mail to appear signed.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-12020` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndirmngr - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngnupg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngnupg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngnupg-l10n - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngnupg-utils - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngnupg2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpg-wks-client - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpg-wks-server - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpgconf - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpgsm - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpgv - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpgv-static - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpgv-win32 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\ngpgv2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nscdaemon - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required\n\npython-gnupg - 0.4.1-1ubuntu1.18.04.1\npython3-gnupg - 0.4.1-1ubuntu1.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
