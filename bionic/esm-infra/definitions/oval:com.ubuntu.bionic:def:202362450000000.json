		"title": "CVE-2023-6245 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "The Candid library causes a Denial of Service while parsing a speciallycrafted payload with 'empty' data type. For example, if the payload is`record { * ; empty }` and the canister interface expects `record { * }`then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an extra field required by thetype. The problem with the type empty is that the candid Rust librarywrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable error when skipping the fieldand thus causing an infinite decoding loop. Canisters using affectedversions of candid are exposed to denial of service by causing the decodingto run indefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximuminstruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payloadwill result in degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisterswritten in Motoko are unaffected.",
