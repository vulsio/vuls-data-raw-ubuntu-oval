		"Title": "CVE-2023-6245 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "The Candid library causes a Denial of Service whileparsing a specially crafted payload with 'empty' data type. For example, if the payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister interfaceexpects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as anextra field required by the type.  The problem with the type empty is thatthe candid Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable errorwhen skipping the field and thus causing an infinite decoding loop.Canisters using affected versions of candid are exposed to denial of service by causing the decoding to runindefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximuminstruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payloadwill result in degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisterswritten in Motoko are unaffected.",
