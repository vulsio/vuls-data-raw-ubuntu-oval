When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsubmodule stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of therequest. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed,despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers werepresent, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.",
