		"Title": "CVE-2020-8694 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Insufficient access control in the Linux kernel driver for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Andreas Kogler, David Oswald, Catherine Easdon, Claudio Canella, and Daniel Gruss discovered that the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to power data. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-8694` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-123-generic - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-4.15.0-123-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-4.15.0-123-lowlatency - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-123-generic - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-123-lowlatency - 4.15.0-123.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-gcp - 4.15.0-1087.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gcp - 5.4.0-1029.31~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1073-gke - 4.15.0-1073.78\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-gke - 5.0.0-1050.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1039-gke - 5.3.0-1039.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gke - 5.4.0-1029.31~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1004-gkeop - 5.4.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-69-generic - 5.3.0-69.65\nlinux-image-5.3.0-69-lowlatency - 5.3.0-69.65\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-69-generic - 5.3.0-69.65\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-69-lowlatency - 5.3.0-69.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-53-generic - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-53-lowlatency - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-53-generic - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-53-lowlatency - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1101-oem - 4.15.0-1101.112\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1071-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1071.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1058-oracle - 4.15.0-1058.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-oracle - 5.4.0-1029.31~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-123-generic - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-4.15.0-123-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-4.15.0-123-lowlatency - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-123-generic - 4.15.0-123.126\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-123-lowlatency - 4.15.0-123.126\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-gcp - 4.15.0-1087.100\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gcp - 5.4.0-1029.31~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1073-gke - 4.15.0-1073.78\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-gke - 5.0.0-1050.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1039-gke - 5.3.0-1039.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gke - 5.4.0-1029.31~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1004-gkeop - 5.4.0-1004.5\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-69-generic - 5.3.0-69.65\nlinux-image-5.3.0-69-lowlatency - 5.3.0-69.65\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-69-generic - 5.3.0-69.65\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-69-lowlatency - 5.3.0-69.65\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-53-generic - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-53-lowlatency - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-53-generic - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-53-lowlatency - 5.4.0-53.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1101-oem - 4.15.0-1101.112\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1071-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1071.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1058-oracle - 4.15.0-1058.64\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-oracle - 5.4.0-1029.31~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
