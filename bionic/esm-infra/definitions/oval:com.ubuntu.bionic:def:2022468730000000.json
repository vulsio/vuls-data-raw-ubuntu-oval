This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the document. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 108.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-46873` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 108.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 108.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 108.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
