		"description": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability inApache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from9.0.0 before 9.4.1.Solr Streaming Expressions allows users to extract data from other SolrClouds, using a \"zkHost\" parameter.When original SolrCloud is setup to use ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs,they will be sent to whatever \"zkHost\" the user provides.An attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeperrequests with credentials and ACLs and extracts the sensitive information,then send a streaming expression using the mock server's address in\"zkHost\".Streaming Expressions are exposed via the \"/streaming\" handler, with \"read\"permissions.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix theissue.From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same serveraddress (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentialsand ACLs when connecting.",
