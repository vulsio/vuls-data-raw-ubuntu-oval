		"Title": "CVE-2022-47520 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing offset validation in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/hif.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds read when parsing a Robust Security Network (RSN) information element from a Netlink packet. It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-47520` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
