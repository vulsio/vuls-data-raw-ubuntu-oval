		"description": "A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux KernelPerformance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve localprivilege escalation. If perf_read_group() is called while an event'ssibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment orwrite to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.
