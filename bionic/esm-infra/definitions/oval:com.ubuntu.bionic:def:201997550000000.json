		"Title": "CVE-2019-9755 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
		"Description": "An integer underflow issue exists in ntfs-3g 2017.3.23. A local attacker could potentially exploit this by running /bin/ntfs-3g with specially crafted arguments from a specially crafted directory to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a crash or the ability to execute arbitrary code. In installations where /bin/ntfs-3g is a setuid-root binary, this could lead to a local escalation of privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9755` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibntfs-3g88 - 1:2017.3.23-2ubuntu0.18.04.1\nntfs-3g - 1:2017.3.23-2ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
