    "Title": "CVE-2002-2439 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "operator new[] sometimes returns pointers to heap blocks which are too small.  When a new array is allocated, the C++ run-time has to calculate its size.  The product may exceed the maximum value which can be stored in a machine register.  This error is ignored, and the truncated value is used for the heap allocation. This may lead to heap overflows and therefore security bugs. (See http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/advisories/calloc.php for further references.)\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2002-2439` to fix the vulnerability.
