		"description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. A fault injection attackon RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users performingsigning operations with private ECC keys, such as in server-side TLSconnections, might leak faulty ECC signatures. These signatures can beprocessed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery. (In 5.5.0 andlater, WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS can be used to address the vulnerability.)",
