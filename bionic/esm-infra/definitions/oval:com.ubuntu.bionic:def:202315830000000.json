		"Title": "CVE-2023-1583 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference was found in io_file_bitmap_get inio_uring/filetable.c in the io_uring sub-component in the Linux Kernel.When fixed files are unregistered, some context information(file_alloc_{start,end} and alloc_hint) is not cleared. A subsequentrequest that has auto index selection enabled via IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOCcan cause a NULL pointer dereference. An unprivileged user can use the flawto cause a system crash.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1583` to fix the vulnerability.
