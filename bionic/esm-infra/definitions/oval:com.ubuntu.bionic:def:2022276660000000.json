		"Title": "CVE-2022-27666 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c and net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat. It was discovered that the IPsec implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate enough memory when performing ESP transformations, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-27666` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-175-generic - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-4.15.0-175-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-4.15.0-175-lowlatency - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-175-generic - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-175-lowlatency - 4.15.0-175.184\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-aws - 4.15.0-1126.135\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-aws - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1136-azure - 4.15.0-1136.149\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-azure - 5.4.0-1074.77~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1040-dell300x - 4.15.0-1040.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-gcp - 4.15.0-1120.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-gcp - 5.4.0-1069.73~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-gke - 5.4.0-1067.70~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-gkeop - 5.4.0-1038.39~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-generic - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-lowlatency - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-107-generic - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-107-lowlatency - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-ibm - 5.4.0-1019.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-kvm - 4.15.0-1112.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-oracle - 4.15.0-1091.100\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-oracle - 5.4.0-1069.75~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1058-raspi - 5.4.0-1058.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1107-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1107.114\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-175-generic - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-4.15.0-175-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-4.15.0-175-lowlatency - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-175-generic - 4.15.0-175.184\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-175-lowlatency - 4.15.0-175.184\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-aws - 4.15.0-1126.135\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-aws - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1136-azure - 4.15.0-1136.149\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1074-azure - 5.4.0-1074.77~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1040-dell300x - 4.15.0-1040.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-gcp - 4.15.0-1120.134\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-gcp - 5.4.0-1069.73~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-gke - 5.4.0-1067.70~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-gkeop - 5.4.0-1038.39~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-generic - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-107-lowlatency - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-107-generic - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-107-lowlatency - 5.4.0-107.121~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-ibm - 5.4.0-1019.21~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-oracle - 4.15.0-1091.100\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-oracle - 5.4.0-1069.75~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1125-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1125.134\nNo subscription required",
