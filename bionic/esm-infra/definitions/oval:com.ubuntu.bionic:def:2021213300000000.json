A maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-servercould redirect the browser to a different website. It is caused by a bug inthe `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware. Thissecurity problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency using pipas follows \"pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4\". If upgrading is not an optionfor you, a workaround can be to avoid using`aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your applications.",
