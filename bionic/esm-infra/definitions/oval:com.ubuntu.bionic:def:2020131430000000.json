		"Title": "CVE-2020-13143 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store in drivers/usb/gadget/configfs.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.6.13 relies on kstrdup without considering the possibility of an internal '\\0' value, which allows attackers to trigger an out-of-bounds read, aka CID-15753588bcd4. It was discovered that the USB Gadget device driver in the Linux kernel did not validate arguments passed from configfs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-13143` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-lowlatency -
