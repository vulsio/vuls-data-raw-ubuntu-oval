		"Description": "Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Versions 5.0.0 andlater, prior to 6.0.1, are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting. WhenSanitize is configured with a custom allowlist that allows `noscript`elements, attackers are able to include arbitrary HTML, resulting in XSS(cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior when that HTML isrendered in a browser. The default configurations do not allow `noscript`elements and are not vulnerable. This issue only affects users who areusing a custom config that adds `noscript` to the element allowlist. Thisissue has been patched in version 6.0.1. Users who are unable to upgradecan prevent this issue by using one of Sanitize's default configs or byensuring that their custom config does not include `noscript` in theelement allowlist.",
