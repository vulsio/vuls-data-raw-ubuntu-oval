		"description": "Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configuredKubernetes resources. When either the Helm client or SDK is used to save achart whose name within the `Chart.yaml` file includes a relative pathchange, the chart would be saved outside its expected directory based onthe changes in the relative path. The validation and linting did not detectthe path changes in the name. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.1.Users unable to upgrade should check all charts used by Helm for pathchanges in their name as found in the `Chart.yaml` file. This includesdependencies.",
