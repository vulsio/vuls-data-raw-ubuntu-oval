    "Title": "CVE-2022-28737 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "There's a possible overflow in handle_image() when shim tries to load and execute crafted EFI executables; The handle_image() function takes into account the SizeOfRawData field from each section to be loaded. An attacker can leverage this to perform out-of-bound writes into memory. Arbitrary code execution is not discarded in such scenario.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-28737` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nshim - 15.7-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
