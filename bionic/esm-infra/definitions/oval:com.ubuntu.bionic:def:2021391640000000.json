In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access themembership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if theyknow the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with`shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must beusing an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room.
