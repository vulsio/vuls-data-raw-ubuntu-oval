		"Title": "CVE-2020-25704 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw memory leak in the Linux kernel performance monitoring subsystem was found in the way if using PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_FILTER. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service. Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25704` to fix the vulnerability.
