		"Title": "CVE-2020-12769 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.17. drivers/spi/spi-dw.c allows attackers to cause a panic via concurrent calls to dw_spi_irq and dw_spi_transfer_one, aka CID-19b61392c5a8. It was discovered that the DesignWare SPI controller driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-12769` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1065-aws - 4.15.0-1065.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1016-aws - 5.3.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1019-azure - 5.3.0-1019.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1017-gcp - 5.3.0-1017.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-gke - 4.15.0-1057.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1033-gke - 5.0.0-1033.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1017-gke - 5.3.0-1017.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-46-generic - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-46-lowlatency - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-46-generic - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-46-lowlatency - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1058-kvm - 4.15.0-1058.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1079-oem - 4.15.0-1079.89\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1047-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-oracle - 4.15.0-1037.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1014-oracle - 5.3.0-1014.15~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1060-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1060.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1022-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1022.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-generic - 4.15.0-96.97\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-96-lowlatency - 4.15.0-96.97\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1065-aws - 4.15.0-1065.69\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1019-azure - 5.3.0-1019.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1017-gcp - 5.3.0-1017.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-gke - 4.15.0-1057.60\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1033-gke - 5.0.0-1033.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1017-gke - 5.3.0-1017.18~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-46-generic - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-46-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-46-lowlatency - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-46-generic - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-46-lowlatency - 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1079-oem - 4.15.0-1079.89\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1047-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1047.52\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-oracle - 4.15.0-1037.41\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1014-oracle - 5.3.0-1014.15~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1076-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1076.83\nNo subscription required",
