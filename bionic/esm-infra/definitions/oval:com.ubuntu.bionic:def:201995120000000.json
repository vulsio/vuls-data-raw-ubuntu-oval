    "Title": "CVE-2019-9512 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both. It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9512` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-core - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-mail - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-names - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-news - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-runner - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-web - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-words - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required\n\npython-twisted-conch - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
