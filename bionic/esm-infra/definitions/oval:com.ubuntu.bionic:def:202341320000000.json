		"Title": "CVE-2023-4132 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the siano smsusb module in the Linux kernel. The bug occurs during device initialization when the siano device is plugged in. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system, causing a denial of service condition. It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4132` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1113.123~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1119.126~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1117.126~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1060.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1112.121~18.04.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1086-raspi - 5.4.0-1097.109~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1113.123~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1119.126~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1117.126~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-166.183~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1060.65~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1112.121~18.04.4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
