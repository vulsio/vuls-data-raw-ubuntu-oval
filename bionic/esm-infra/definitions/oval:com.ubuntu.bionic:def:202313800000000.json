		"Title": "CVE-2023-1380 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
		"Description": "A slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service. It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1380` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-aws - 4.15.0-1157.170\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1166-azure - 4.15.0-1166.181\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1109.115~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-gcp - 4.15.0-1151.167\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1050.55~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1141-kvm - 4.15.0-1141.146\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-oracle - 4.15.0-1120.131\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1102.111~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1086-raspi - 5.4.0-1086.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-aws - 4.15.0-1157.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1166-azure - 4.15.0-1166.181\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1109.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-gcp - 4.15.0-1151.167\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1050.55~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-oracle - 4.15.0-1120.131\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1102.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1151-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1151.161\nNo subscription required",
