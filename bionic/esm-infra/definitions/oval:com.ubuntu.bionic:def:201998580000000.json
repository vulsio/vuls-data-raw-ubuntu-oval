		"Title": "CVE-2019-9858 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "Remote code execution was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail 5.2.22 and5.2.17. Horde/Form/Type.php contains a vulnerable class that handles imageupload in forms. When the Horde_Form_Type_image method onSubmit() is calledon uploads, it invokes the functions getImage() and _getUpload(), whichuses unsanitized user input as a path to save the image. The unsanitizedPOST parameter object[photo][img][file] is saved in the $upload[img][file]PHP variable, allowing an attacker to manipulate the $tmp_file passed tomove_uploaded_file() to save the uploaded file. By setting the parameter to(for example) ../usr/share/horde/static/bd.php, one can write a PHPbackdoor inside the web root. The static/ destination folder is a goodcandidate to drop the backdoor because it is always writable in Hordeinstallations. (The unsanitized POST parameter went probably unnoticedbecause it's never submitted by the forms, which default to securely usinga random path.)",
