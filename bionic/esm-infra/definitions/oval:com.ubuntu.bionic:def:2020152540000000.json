		"Title": "CVE-2020-15254 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15254` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 82.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 82.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 82.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
