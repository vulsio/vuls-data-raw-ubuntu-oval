    "Description": "Division-by-zero vulnerabilities in the functions pi_next_pcrl, pi_next_cprl, and pi_next_rpcl in openmj2/pi.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.0 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash). It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain image files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",

Before the refactoring, there was a single pi.c file, which according to the code itself, seems to be affected by this vulnerability, however, it looks like the vulnerability in this case is related to CVE-2018-14423 instead, which has a very similar patch (bd88611ed9a)."
