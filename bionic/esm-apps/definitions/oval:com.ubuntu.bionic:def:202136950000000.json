		"Title": "CVE-2021-3695 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write inthe heap area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap datacorruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent secureboot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as anattacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout to achievesignifcant results, also the values written into the memory are repeatedthree times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flawaffects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3695` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu14.1\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.187.3~18.04.1+2.06-2ubuntu14.1\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.187.3~18.04.1+2.06-2ubuntu14.1\nNo subscription required",
