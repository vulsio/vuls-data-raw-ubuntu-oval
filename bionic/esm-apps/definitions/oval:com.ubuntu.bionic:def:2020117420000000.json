		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users tocause a denial of service because of bad continuation handling inGNTTABOP_copy. Grant table operations are expected to return 0 for success,and a negative number for errors. The fix for CVE-2017-12135 introduced apath through grant copy handling where success may be returned to thecaller without any action taken. In particular, the status fields ofindividual operations are left uninitialised, and may result in errantbehaviour in the caller of GNTTABOP_copy. A buggy or malicious guest canconstruct its grant table in such a way that, when a backend domain triesto copy a grant, it hits the incorrect exit path. This returns success tothe caller without doing anything, which may cause crashes or otherincorrect behaviour.",
