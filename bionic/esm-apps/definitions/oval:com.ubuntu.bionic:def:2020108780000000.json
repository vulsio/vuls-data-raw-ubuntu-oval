		"Title": "CVE-2020-10878 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low",
		"Description": "Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a\"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\" situation. A crafted regular expressioncould lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instructioninjection. An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this usage scenario.]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10878` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibperl5.26 - 5.26.1-6ubuntu0.5\nperl - 5.26.1-6ubuntu0.5\nperl-base - 5.26.1-6ubuntu0.5\nperl-debug - 5.26.1-6ubuntu0.5\nperl-modules-5.26 - 5.26.1-6ubuntu0.5\nNo subscription required",
