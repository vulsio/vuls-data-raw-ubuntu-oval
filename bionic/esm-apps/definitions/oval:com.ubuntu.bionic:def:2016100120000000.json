    "Title": "CVE-2016-10012 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression) in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-10012` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:7.4p1-1\nopenssh-server - 1:7.4p1-1\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:7.4p1-1\nssh - 1:7.4p1-1\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:7.4p1-1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
