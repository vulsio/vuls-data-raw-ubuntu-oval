		"Title": "CVE-2021-34693 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.10 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory because parts of a data structure are uninitialized. Norbert Slusarek discovered that the CAN broadcast manger (bcm) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-34693` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1055-aws - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-azure - 5.4.0-1056.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gcp - 5.4.0-1051.55~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gke - 5.4.0-1051.54~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gkeop - 5.4.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-kvm - 4.15.0-1099.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-oracle - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1042-raspi - 5.4.0-1042.46~18.04.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1095-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1095.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1055-aws - 5.4.0-1055.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-azure - 5.4.0-1056.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gcp - 5.4.0-1051.55~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gke - 5.4.0-1051.54~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gkeop - 5.4.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-generic - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-lowlatency - 5.4.0-81.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-oracle - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1112.121\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
