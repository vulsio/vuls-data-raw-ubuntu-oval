		"Title": "CVE-2023-2860 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in the SR-IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel. The flaw exists within the processing of seg6 attributes. The issue results from the improper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a privileged local user to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux kernel. Lucas Leong discovered that the IPv6 SR implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SEG6 configuration attributes, leading to an out- of-bounds read vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2860` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-201-generic - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-4.15.0-201-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-4.15.0-201-lowlatency - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-201-generic - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-201-lowlatency - 4.15.0-201.212\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1147-aws - 4.15.0-1147.159\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1158-azure - 4.15.0-1158.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-gcp - 4.15.0-1142.158\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1133-kvm - 4.15.0-1133.138\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-oracle - 4.15.0-1112.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1078-raspi - 5.4.0-1078.89~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-201-generic - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-4.15.0-201-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-4.15.0-201-lowlatency - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-201-generic - 4.15.0-201.212\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-201-lowlatency - 4.15.0-201.212\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1147-aws - 4.15.0-1147.159\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1158-azure - 4.15.0-1158.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-gcp - 4.15.0-1142.158\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-oracle - 4.15.0-1112.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
