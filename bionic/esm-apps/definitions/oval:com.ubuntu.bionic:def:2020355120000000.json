    "Title": "CVE-2020-35512 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus Development branch <= 1.13.16, dbus-1.12.x stable branch <= 1.12.18, and dbus-1.10.x and older branches <= 1.10.30 when a system has multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a set of policy rules references these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory in the heap, which is still used by data structures necessary for the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behaviors\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-35512` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndbus - 1.12.2-1ubuntu1.3\ndbus-tests - 1.12.2-1ubuntu1.3\ndbus-user-session - 1.12.2-1ubuntu1.3\ndbus-x11 - 1.12.2-1ubuntu1.3\nlibdbus-1-3 - 1.12.2-1ubuntu1.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
