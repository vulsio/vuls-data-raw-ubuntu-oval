		"Description": "Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates tomultiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspondto which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zeromemory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365,CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn'tallow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing inthe same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by suchbackend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33741` to fix the vulnerability.
