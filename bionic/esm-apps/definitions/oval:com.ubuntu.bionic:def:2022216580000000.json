		"Title": "CVE-2022-21658 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed forperformance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust SecurityResponse WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standardlibrary function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following(CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privilegedprogram into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwiseaccess or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by thisvulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following buildtargets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and arethus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to runin privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), asthose have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that addingchecks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate thevulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions likeremove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intendedoutside of race conditions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-21658` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibstd-rust-1.59 - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-all - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-clippy - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-gdb - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-lldb - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-src - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrustc - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrustfmt - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
