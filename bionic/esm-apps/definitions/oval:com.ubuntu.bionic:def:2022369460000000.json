    "Title": "CVE-2022-36946 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "nfqnl_mangle in net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because, in the case of an nf_queue verdict with a one-byte nfta_payload attribute, an skb_pull can encounter a negative skb->len. Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-36946` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-193-generic - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-4.15.0-193-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-4.15.0-193-lowlatency - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-193-generic - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-193-lowlatency - 4.15.0-193.204\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1141-aws - 4.15.0-1141.152\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-azure - 4.15.0-1151.166\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1053-dell300x - 4.15.0-1053.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1136-gcp - 4.15.0-1136.152\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1127-kvm - 4.15.0-1127.132\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-oracle - 4.15.0-1106.117\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1070-raspi - 5.4.0-1070.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1119.127\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-193-generic - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-4.15.0-193-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-4.15.0-193-lowlatency - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-193-generic - 4.15.0-193.204\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-193-lowlatency - 4.15.0-193.204\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1141-aws - 4.15.0-1141.152\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-azure - 4.15.0-1151.166\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1053-dell300x - 4.15.0-1053.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1136-gcp - 4.15.0-1136.152\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-oracle - 4.15.0-1106.117\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1137-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1137.147\nNo subscription required",
