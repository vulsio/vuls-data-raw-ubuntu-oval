		"Title": "CVE-2022-32250 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
		"Description": "net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able to create user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to a use-after-free. Aaron Adams discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle non-statefule expressions in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-32250` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-lowlatency -
