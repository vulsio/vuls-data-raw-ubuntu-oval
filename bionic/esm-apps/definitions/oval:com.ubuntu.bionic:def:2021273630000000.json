		"Title": "CVE-2021-27363 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernelpointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transportstructure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem,the transport's handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfsfile system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. Whenread, the show_transport_handle function (indrivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle.This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in thekernel module's global variables.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-27363` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-139.143\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-139.143\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-139.143\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-139.143\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-139.143\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-70.78~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1087.89\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1096.103\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1041.43~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1110.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1015-dell300x - 4.15.0-1015.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1095.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1040.43~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1041-gke - 5.3.0-1041.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-gke - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1012-gkeop - 5.4.0-1012.13~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1067.75\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1041.44~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1081-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1081.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1038-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1038.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1032.35~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1098-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1098.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
