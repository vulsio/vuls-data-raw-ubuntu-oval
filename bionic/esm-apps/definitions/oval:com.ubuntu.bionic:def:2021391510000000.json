		"Title": "CVE-2021-39151 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-39151` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibxstream-java - 1.4.11.1-1+deb10u4build0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
