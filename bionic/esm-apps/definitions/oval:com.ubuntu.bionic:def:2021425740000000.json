		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm inthe Unicode Specification through 14.0. It permits the visual reordering ofcharacters via control sequences, which can be used to craft source codethat renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingestedby compilers and interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encodesource code for compilers accepting Unicode such that targetedvulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: theUnicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presentingthis concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text thatcan affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard andthe Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text displaybehavior when text includes left-to-right and right-to-left characters, thevisual order of tokens may be different from their logical order.Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirementsof bidirectional text can further obfuscate the logical order of tokens.Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such that theordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will beprocessed by a compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium hasdocumented this class of vulnerability in its document, Unicode TechnicalReport #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium alsoprovides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in UnicodeTechnical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, and in UnicodeStandard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the BIDIspecification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways thatcan mitigate misleading visual reordering in program text; see HL4 inUnicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-42574` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibstd-rust-1.57 - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nrust-all - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nrust-clippy - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nrust-gdb - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nrust-lldb - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nrust-src - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nrustc - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nrustfmt - 1.57.0+dfsg1+llvm-0ubuntu1~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
