		"Note": "sbeattie> the `oidReset` command implementation has existed in a couple of different locations in mongodb history, in src/mongo/db/commands/generic.cpp during 3.6.x and src/mongo/db/dbcommands_generic.cpp in 2.x timeframe. All of those implementations of `oidReset` lack an authorization requirement. all of the upstream commits for this issue are on branches licensed under mongodb's SSPL, which makes backporting them to GNU Affero licensed versions problematic."
