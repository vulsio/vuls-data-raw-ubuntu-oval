		"Title": "CVE-2020-10711 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinuxsubsystem in versions before 5.7. This flaw occurs while importing theCommercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into theSELinux extensible bitmap via the' ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine. Whileprocessing the CIPSO restricted bitmap tag in the 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm'routine, it sets the security attribute to indicate that the categorybitmap is present, even if it has not been allocated. This issue leads to aNULL pointer dereference issue while importing the same category bitmapinto SELinux. This flaw allows a remote network user to crash the systemkernel, resulting in a denial of service.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10711` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-109.110\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-62-generic - 5.3.0-62.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-62-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-62.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-62-lowlatency - 5.3.0-62.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-62-generic - 5.3.0-62.56~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-62-lowlatency - 5.3.0-62.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-oem - 4.15.0-1091.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1063-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1063.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1069.70\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1077.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1032-azure - 5.3.0-1032.33~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1030-gcp - 5.3.0-1030.32~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1064-gke - 4.15.0-1064.67\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1043-gke - 5.0.0-1043.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1048.52\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1065-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1065.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1081-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1081.88\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1028-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1028.30~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1030-gke - 5.3.0-1030.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1028-oracle - 5.3.0-1028.30~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1030-aws - 5.3.0-1030.32~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1078.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1013.13~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
