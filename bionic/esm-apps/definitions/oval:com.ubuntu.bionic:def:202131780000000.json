		"Title": "CVE-2021-3178 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - negligible.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.8, when there is an NFS export of a subdirectory of a filesystem, allows remote attackers to traverse to other parts of the filesystem via READDIRPLUS. NOTE: some parties argue that such a subdirectory export is not intended to prevent this attack; see also the exports(5) no_subtree_check default behavior. 吴异 discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent access outside of an NFS export that is a subdirectory of a file system. An attacker could possibly use this to bypass NFS access restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3178` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1095-aws - 4.15.0-1095.102\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1039-aws - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-azure - 4.15.0-1109.121\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-azure - 5.4.0-1041.43~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-dell300x - 4.15.0-1013.17\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-gcp - 4.15.0-1094.107\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-gcp - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gke - 5.4.0-1037.39~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1011-gkeop - 5.4.0-1011.12~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1086-kvm - 4.15.0-1086.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1066-oracle - 4.15.0-1066.74\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-oracle - 5.4.0-1039.42~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1030-raspi - 5.4.0-1030.33~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1080-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1080.85\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-generic - 4.15.0-137.141\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-137-lowlatency - 4.15.0-137.141\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1095-aws - 4.15.0-1095.102\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1039-aws - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1109-azure - 4.15.0-1109.121\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-azure - 5.4.0-1041.43~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1013-dell300x - 4.15.0-1013.17\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-gcp - 4.15.0-1094.107\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1038-gcp - 5.4.0-1038.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gke - 5.4.0-1037.39~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1011-gkeop - 5.4.0-1011.12~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-generic - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-67-lowlatency - 5.4.0-67.75~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1066-oracle - 4.15.0-1066.74\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-oracle - 5.4.0-1039.42~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1097.106\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
