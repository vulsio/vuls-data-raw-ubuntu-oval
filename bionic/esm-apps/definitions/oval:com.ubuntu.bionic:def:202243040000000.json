		"Title": "CVE-2022-4304 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryptionimplementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across anetwork in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successfuldecryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number oftrial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA paddingmodes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection,RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret tothe server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between aclient and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to theserver and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficientlylarge number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secretused for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4304` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.1 - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.21\nopenssl - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.21\nNo subscription required",
