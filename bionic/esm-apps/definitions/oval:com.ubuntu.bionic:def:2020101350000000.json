		"Title": "CVE-2020-10135 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in Bluetooth BR/EDR Core Specification v5.2 and earlier may allow an unauthenticated user to complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could impersonate a Bluetooth BR/EDR master or slave to pair with a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure without knowing the link key. Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen discovered that legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in the Bluetooth protocol could allow an unauthenticated user to complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. A physically proximate attacker could use this to impersonate a previously paired Bluetooth device.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10135` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-lowlatency -
