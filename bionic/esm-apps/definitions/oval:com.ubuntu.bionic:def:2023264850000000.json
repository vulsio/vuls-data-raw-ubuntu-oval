		"Title": "CVE-2023-26485 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and renderinglibrary and program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfmmay lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when parsing text which leadswith either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has been addressedin version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable toupgrade should validate that their input comes from trusted sources. ###Impact A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead tounbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. ### Proofof concept ``` $ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = \"_\" * 100000; print(pad +\".\" + pad, end=\"\")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext ```Increasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running timeto increase quadratically. ### Patches This vulnerability have been patchedin 0.29.0.gfm.10. ### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm XXX: TBD[cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of[cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub FlavoredMarkdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time, but share acommon core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. ### Credit Wewould like to thank @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability. ###References https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity ### For moreinformation If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: *Open an issue in [github/cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)",
