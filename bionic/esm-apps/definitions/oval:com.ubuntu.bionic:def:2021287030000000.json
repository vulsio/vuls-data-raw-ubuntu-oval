		"Title": "CVE-2021-28703 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "grant table v2 status pages may remain accessible after de-allocation (taketwo) Guest get permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. Themajority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for itsentire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocatedwhen a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pagesrequires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages weremapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racingrequests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in anyof them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed andperhaps re-used for other purposes. This bug was fortuitously fixed by codecleanup in Xen 4.14, and backported to security-supported Xen branches as aprerequisite of the fix for XSA-378.",
