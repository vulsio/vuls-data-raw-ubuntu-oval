		"Title": "CVE-2023-23454 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). Kyle Zeng discovered that the class-based queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-23454` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
