		"Title": "CVE-2017-5120 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Inappropriate use of www mismatch redirects in browser navigation in Google Chrome prior to 61.0.3163.79 for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and 61.0.3163.81 for Android, allowed a remote attacker to potentially downgrade HTTPS requests to HTTP via a crafted HTML page. In other words, Chrome could transmit cleartext even though the user had entered an https URL, because of a misdesigned workaround for cases where the domain name in a URL almost matches the domain name in an X.509 server certificate (but differs in the initial \"www.\" substring).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5120` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nchromium-browser - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-browser-l10n - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-chromedriver - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-codecs-ffmpeg - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
