		"title": "CVE-2022-41715 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Programs which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may bevulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexprepresentation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases theconstant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexpsconsume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsedis limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whoserepresentation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use ofregular expressions is unaffected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41715` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngolang-1.18 - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4\ngolang-1.18-go - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4\ngolang-1.18-src - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4\nNo subscription required",
