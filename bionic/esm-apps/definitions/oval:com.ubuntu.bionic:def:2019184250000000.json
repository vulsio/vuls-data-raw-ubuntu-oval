		"Title": "CVE-2019-18425 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OSusers to gain guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors.There is missing descriptor table limit checking in x86 PV emulation. Whenemulating certain PV guest operations, descriptor table accesses areperformed by the emulating code. Such accesses should respect the guestspecified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case.Without this, emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gateswould allow guest user mode to install and then use descriptors of theirchoice, as long as the guest kernel did not itself install an LDT. (MostOSes don't install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user mode canelevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from atleast 3.2 onwards are affected. Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leveragethis vulnerability. HVM, PVH, as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leveragethis vulnerability. Arm systems are unaffected.",
