    "Title": "CVE-2021-28038 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3, as used with Xen PV. A certain part of the netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors). A host OS denial of service may occur during misbehavior of a networking frontend driver. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-26931. Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28038` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1048-aws - 5.4.0-1048.50~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-azure - 4.15.0-1114.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-azure - 5.4.0-1047.49~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-dell300x - 4.15.0-1018.22\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gcp - 5.4.0-1043.46~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gke - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1015-gkeop - 5.4.0-1015.16~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-73-generic - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-73-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-73-lowlatency - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-73-generic - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-73-lowlatency - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1091-kvm - 4.15.0-1091.93\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-oracle - 5.4.0-1044.47~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1035-raspi - 5.4.0-1035.38~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1085-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1085.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-generic - 4.15.0-143.147\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-143-lowlatency - 4.15.0-143.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-aws - 4.15.0-1102.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1048-aws - 5.4.0-1048.50~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-azure - 4.15.0-1114.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-azure - 5.4.0-1047.49~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-dell300x - 4.15.0-1018.22\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1099-gcp - 4.15.0-1099.112\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gcp - 5.4.0-1043.46~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1043-gke - 5.4.0-1043.45~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1015-gkeop - 5.4.0-1015.16~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-73-generic - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-73-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-73-lowlatency - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-73-generic - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-73-lowlatency - 5.4.0-73.82~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-oracle - 4.15.0-1071.79\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-oracle - 5.4.0-1044.47~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1102.111\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
