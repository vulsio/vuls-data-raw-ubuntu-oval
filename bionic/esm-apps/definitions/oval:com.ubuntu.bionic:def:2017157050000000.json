		"Title": "CVE-2017-15705 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A denial of service vulnerability was identified that exists in ApacheSpamAssassin before 3.4.2. The vulnerability arises with certain unclosedtags in emails that cause markup to be handled incorrectly leading to scantimeouts. In Apache SpamAssassin, using HTML::Parser, we setup an objectand hook into the begin and end tag event handlers In both cases, the\"open\" event is immediately followed by a \"close\" event - even if the tag*does not* close in the HTML being parsed. Because of this, we are missingthe \"text\" event to deal with the object normally. This can cause carefullycrafted emails that might take more scan time than expected leading to aDenial of Service. The issue is possibly a bug or design decision inHTML::Parser that specifically impacts the way Apache SpamAssassin uses themodule with poorly formed html. The exploit has been seen in the wild butnot believed to have been purposefully part of a Denial of Service attempt.We are concerned that there may be attempts to abuse the vulnerability inthe future.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-15705` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsa-compile - 3.4.2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nspamassassin - 3.4.2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nspamc - 3.4.2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
