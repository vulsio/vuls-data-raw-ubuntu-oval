    "Description": "In Xpdf 4.01.01, a heap-based buffer overflow could be triggered in DCTStream::decodeImage() in Stream.cc when writing to frameBuf memory. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftotext tool. It allows an attacker to use a crafted pdf file to cause Denial of Service, an information leak, or possibly unspecified other impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-13281` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-poppler-0.18 - 0.62.0-2ubuntu2.9\nlibpoppler-cpp0v5 - 0.62.0-2ubuntu2.9\nlibpoppler-glib8 - 0.62.0-2ubuntu2.9\nlibpoppler-qt5-1 - 0.62.0-2ubuntu2.9\nlibpoppler73 - 0.62.0-2ubuntu2.9\npoppler-utils - 0.62.0-2ubuntu2.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
