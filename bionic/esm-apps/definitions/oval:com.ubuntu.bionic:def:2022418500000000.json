    "Title": "CVE-2022-41850 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "roccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a report->value is in progress. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Roccat HID driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41850` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-kvm - 4.15.0-1135.140\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1080-raspi - 5.4.0-1080.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1127-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1127.135\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1145.155\nNo subscription required",
