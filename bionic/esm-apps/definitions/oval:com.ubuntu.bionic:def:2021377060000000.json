    "Title": "CVE-2021-37706 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim’s network may forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-37706` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nring - 20180228.1.503da2b~ds1-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nring-daemon - 20180228.1.503da2b~ds1-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
