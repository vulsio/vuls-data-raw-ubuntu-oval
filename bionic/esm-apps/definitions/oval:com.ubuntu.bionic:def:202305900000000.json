		"Title": "CVE-2023-0590 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux Kernel due to a race problem. This flaw leads to a denial of service issue. If patch ebda44da44f6 (\"net: sched: fix race condition in qdisc_graft()\") not applied yet, then kernel could be affected. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0590` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-azure - 5.4.0-1113.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1091-raspi - 5.4.0-1091.102~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-azure - 5.4.0-1113.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
