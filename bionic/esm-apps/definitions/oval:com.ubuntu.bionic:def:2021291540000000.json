    "Title": "CVE-2021-29154 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel through 5.11.12 have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF JIT compiler for x86 in the Linux kernel did not properly validate computation of branch displacements in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29154` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic - 4.15.0-142.146\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-142.146\nlinux-image-4.15.0-142-lowlatency -
