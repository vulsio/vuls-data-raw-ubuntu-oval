		"Title": "CVE-2022-48502 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.2. The ntfs3 subsystem does not properly check for correctness during disk reads, leading to an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_set_ea in fs/ntfs3/xattr.c. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48502` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1013-raspi - 5.4.0-1013.13~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
