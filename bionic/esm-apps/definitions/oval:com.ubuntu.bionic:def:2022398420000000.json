    "Title": "CVE-2022-39842 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the PXA3xx graphics driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39842` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-kvm - 4.15.0-1135.140\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1078-raspi - 5.4.0-1078.89~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1127-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1127.135\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-aws - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-azure - 5.4.0-1100.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-gcp - 5.4.0-1097.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-generic - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-136-lowlatency - 5.4.0-136.153~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1041-ibm - 5.4.0-1041.46~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-oracle - 5.4.0-1091.100~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1145.155\nNo subscription required",
