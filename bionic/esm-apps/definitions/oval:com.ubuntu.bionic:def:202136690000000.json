		"Title": "CVE-2021-3669 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Measuring usage of the shared memory does not scale with large shared memory segment counts which could lead to resource exhaustion and DoS. It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3669` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-aws - 4.15.0-1153.166\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-aws - 5.4.0-1099.107~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-azure - 5.4.0-1105.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1062-dell300x - 4.15.0-1062.67\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1147-gcp - 4.15.0-1147.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-gcp - 5.4.0-1102.111~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-lowlatency - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-lowlatency - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-ibm - 5.4.0-1046.51~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1137-kvm - 4.15.0-1137.142\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-oracle - 4.15.0-1116.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-oracle - 5.4.0-1098.107~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1129-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1129.137\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-generic - 4.15.0-208.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-208-lowlatency - 4.15.0-208.220\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-aws - 4.15.0-1153.166\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-aws - 5.4.0-1099.107~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-azure - 5.4.0-1105.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1062-dell300x - 4.15.0-1062.67\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1147-gcp - 4.15.0-1147.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-gcp - 5.4.0-1102.111~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-146-lowlatency - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-generic - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-146-lowlatency - 5.4.0-146.163~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-ibm - 5.4.0-1046.51~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-oracle - 4.15.0-1116.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-oracle - 5.4.0-1098.107~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1148-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1148.158\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
