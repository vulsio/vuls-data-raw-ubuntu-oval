		"Title": "CVE-2020-10757 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in versions after 4.5-rc1 in the way mremap handled DAX Huge Pages. This flaw allows a local attacker with access to a DAX enabled storage to escalate their privileges on the system. Fan Yang discovered that the mremap implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle DAX Huge Pages. A local attacker with access to DAX storage could use this to gain administrative privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10757` to fix the vulnerability.
