    "Title": "CVE-2020-13974 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.4 through 5.7.1. drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue in this case. It was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use this to have an unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-13974` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-lowlatency -
