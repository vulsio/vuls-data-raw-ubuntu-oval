		"Title": "CVE-2019-19770 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free (read) in the debugfs_remove function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is used to remove a file or directory in debugfs that was previously created with a call to another debugfs function such as debugfs_create_file). NOTE: Linux kernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs, instead this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace. It was discovered that debugfs in the Linux kernel as used by blktrace contained a use-after-free in some situations. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19770` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-lowlatency -
