    "Title": "CVE-2021-38160 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE: the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior. It was discovered that the Virtio console implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate input lengths in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-38160` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1057-aws - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-azure - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gcp - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gke - 5.4.0-1053.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-gkeop - 5.4.0-1024.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-kvm - 4.15.0-1099.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-oracle - 5.4.0-1055.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1095-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1095.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-generic - 4.15.0-156.163\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-156-lowlatency - 4.15.0-156.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1111-aws - 4.15.0-1111.118\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1057-aws - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-azure - 5.4.0-1059.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gcp - 5.4.0-1053.57~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-gke - 5.4.0-1053.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-gkeop - 5.4.0-1024.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-generic - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-87-lowlatency - 5.4.0-87.98~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oracle - 4.15.0-1080.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-oracle - 5.4.0-1055.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1112-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1112.121\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
