    "Title": "CVE-2021-4083 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4083` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-aws - 4.15.0-1121.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-aws - 5.4.0-1066.69~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-azure - 5.4.0-1070.73~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1035-dell300x - 4.15.0-1035.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-gcp - 4.15.0-1116.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-gcp - 5.4.0-1065.69~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-gkeop - 5.4.0-1034.35~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-generic - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-lowlatency - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-100-generic - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-100-lowlatency - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1015-ibm - 5.4.0-1015.16~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1107-kvm - 4.15.0-1107.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-oracle - 4.15.0-1087.95\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-oracle - 5.4.0-1064.68~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1053-raspi - 5.4.0-1053.60~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1103.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-generic - 4.15.0-169.177\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-169-lowlatency - 4.15.0-169.177\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-aws - 4.15.0-1121.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-aws - 5.4.0-1066.69~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1070-azure - 5.4.0-1070.73~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1035-dell300x - 4.15.0-1035.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1116-gcp - 4.15.0-1116.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-gcp - 5.4.0-1065.69~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-gkeop - 5.4.0-1034.35~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-generic - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-100-lowlatency - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-100-generic - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-100-lowlatency - 5.4.0-100.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1015-ibm - 5.4.0-1015.16~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-oracle - 4.15.0-1087.95\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-oracle - 5.4.0-1064.68~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1120-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1120.129\nNo subscription required",
