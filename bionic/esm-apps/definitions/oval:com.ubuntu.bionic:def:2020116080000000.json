    "Title": "CVE-2020-11608 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.1. drivers/media/usb/gspca/ov519.c allows NULL pointer dereferences in ov511_mode_init_regs and ov518_mode_init_regs when there are zero endpoints, aka CID-998912346c0d. It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-11608` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1066-aws - 4.15.0-1066.70\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1019-aws - 5.3.0-1019.21~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1022-azure - 5.3.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gcp - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1058-gke - 4.15.0-1058.61\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1037-gke - 5.0.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gke - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1059-kvm - 4.15.0-1059.60\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oem - 4.15.0-1080.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1052-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1052.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-oracle - 4.15.0-1038.42\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-oracle - 5.3.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1061-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1061.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1026-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1026.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1066-aws - 4.15.0-1066.70\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1022-azure - 5.3.0-1022.23~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gcp - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1058-gke - 4.15.0-1058.61\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1037-gke - 5.0.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-gke - 5.3.0-1020.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-generic - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-53-lowlatency - 5.3.0-53.47~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oem - 4.15.0-1080.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1052-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1052.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-oracle - 4.15.0-1038.42\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-oracle - 5.3.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1077.84\nNo subscription required",
