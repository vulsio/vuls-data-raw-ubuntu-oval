		"Title": "CVE-2022-21166 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Incomplete cleanup in specific special register write operations for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. It was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly perform cleanup during specific special register write operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-21166` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nintel-microcode - 3.20220510.0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-187-generic - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-4.15.0-187-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-4.15.0-187-lowlatency - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-187-generic - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-187-lowlatency - 4.15.0-187.198\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1136-aws - 4.15.0-1136.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-aws - 5.4.0-1080.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-azure - 4.15.0-1145.160\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-azure - 5.4.0-1085.90~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1048-dell300x - 4.15.0-1048.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-gcp - 4.15.0-1130.146\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gcp - 5.4.0-1080.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gke - 5.4.0-1076.82~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-gkeop - 5.4.0-1048.51~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-120-generic - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-120-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-120-lowlatency - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-120-generic - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-120-lowlatency - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-ibm - 5.4.0-1028.32~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1122-kvm - 4.15.0-1122.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1101-oracle - 4.15.0-1101.112\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-oracle - 5.4.0-1078.86~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-187-generic - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-4.15.0-187-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-4.15.0-187-lowlatency - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-187-generic - 4.15.0-187.198\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-187-lowlatency - 4.15.0-187.198\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1136-aws - 4.15.0-1136.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-aws - 5.4.0-1080.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-azure - 4.15.0-1145.160\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-azure - 5.4.0-1085.90~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1048-dell300x - 4.15.0-1048.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-gcp - 4.15.0-1130.146\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gcp - 5.4.0-1080.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-gke - 5.4.0-1076.82~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-gkeop - 5.4.0-1048.51~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-120-generic - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-120-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-120-lowlatency - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-120-generic - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-120-lowlatency - 5.4.0-120.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-ibm - 5.4.0-1028.32~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1101-oracle - 4.15.0-1101.112\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-oracle - 5.4.0-1078.86~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
