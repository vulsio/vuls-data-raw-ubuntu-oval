		"Title": "CVE-2023-38546 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low",
		"Description": "This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a runningprogram using libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met.libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates \"easyhandles\" that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurlprovides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called[curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).If a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, thecookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actualcookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific fileon disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file nameas `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes). Subsequent use of thecloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies fromwould then inadvertently load cookies from a file named `none` - if such afile exists and is readable in the current directory of the program usinglibcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.",
