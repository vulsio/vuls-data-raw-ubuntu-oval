		"Title": "CVE-2019-19073 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "Memory leaks in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering wait_for_completion_timeout() failures. This affects the htc_config_pipe_credits() function, the htc_setup_complete() function, and the htc_connect_service() function, aka CID-853acf7caf10. It was discovered that the Atheros HTC based wireless driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19073` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-lowlatency -
