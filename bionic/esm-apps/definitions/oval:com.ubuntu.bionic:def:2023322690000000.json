		"Title": "CVE-2023-32269 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.1.11. In net/netrom/af_netrom.c, there is a use-after-free because accept is also allowed for a successfully connected AF_NETROM socket. However, in order for an attacker to exploit this, the system must have netrom routing configured or the attacker must have the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. It was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-32269` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-211-generic - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-4.15.0-211-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-4.15.0-211-lowlatency - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-211-generic - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-211-lowlatency - 4.15.0-211.222\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-aws - 4.15.0-1156.169\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1165-azure - 4.15.0-1165.180\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-azure - 5.4.0-1108.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-gcp - 4.15.0-1150.166\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gcp - 5.4.0-1105.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-ibm - 5.4.0-1049.54~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1140-kvm - 4.15.0-1140.145\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-oracle - 4.15.0-1119.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1085-raspi - 5.4.0-1085.96~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1132-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1132.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-211-generic - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-4.15.0-211-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-4.15.0-211-lowlatency - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-211-generic - 4.15.0-211.222\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-211-lowlatency - 4.15.0-211.222\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-aws - 4.15.0-1156.169\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1165-azure - 4.15.0-1165.180\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-azure - 5.4.0-1108.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-gcp - 4.15.0-1150.166\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-gcp - 5.4.0-1105.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-149-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-149-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-ibm - 5.4.0-1049.54~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-oracle - 4.15.0-1119.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1150-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1150.160\nNo subscription required",
