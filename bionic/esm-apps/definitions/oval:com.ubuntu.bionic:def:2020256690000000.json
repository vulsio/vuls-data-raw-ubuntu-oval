		"Title": "CVE-2020-25669 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux Kernel where the function sunkbd_reinit having been scheduled by sunkbd_interrupt before sunkbd being freed. Though the dangling pointer is set to NULL in sunkbd_disconnect, there is still an alias in sunkbd_reinit causing Use After Free. Bodong Zhao discovered a use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25669` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-lowlatency -
