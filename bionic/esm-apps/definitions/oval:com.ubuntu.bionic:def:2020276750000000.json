    "Title": "CVE-2020-27675 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.9.1, as used with Xen through 4.14.x. drivers/xen/events/events_base.c allows event-channel removal during the event-handling loop (a race condition). This can cause a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated by a dom0 crash via events for an in-reconfiguration paravirtualized device, aka CID-073d0552ead5. Jinoh Kang discovered that the Xen event channel infrastructure in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. An attacker in guest could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (dom0 crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-27675` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-lowlatency -
