    "Title": "CVE-2023-1829 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. We recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28. It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for the TCINDEX classifier has been removed.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1829` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-210-generic - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-4.15.0-210-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-4.15.0-210-lowlatency - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-210-generic - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-210-lowlatency - 4.15.0-210.221\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-aws - 4.15.0-1155.168\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-aws - 5.4.0-1101.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1164-azure - 4.15.0-1164.179\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-azure - 5.4.0-1107.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-gcp - 4.15.0-1149.165\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-gcp - 5.4.0-1104.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-lowlatency - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-lowlatency - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-ibm - 5.4.0-1048.53~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1139-kvm - 4.15.0-1139.144\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1118-oracle - 4.15.0-1118.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-oracle - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1084-raspi - 5.4.0-1084.95~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1131-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1131.139\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-210-generic - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-4.15.0-210-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-4.15.0-210-lowlatency - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-210-generic - 4.15.0-210.221\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-210-lowlatency - 4.15.0-210.221\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-aws - 4.15.0-1155.168\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-aws - 5.4.0-1101.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1164-azure - 4.15.0-1164.179\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-azure - 5.4.0-1107.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-gcp - 4.15.0-1149.165\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-gcp - 5.4.0-1104.113~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-148-lowlatency - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-generic - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-148-lowlatency - 5.4.0-148.165~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-ibm - 5.4.0-1048.53~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1118-oracle - 4.15.0-1118.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-oracle - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1149-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1149.159\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
