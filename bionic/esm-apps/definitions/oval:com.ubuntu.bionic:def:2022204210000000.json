		"Title": "CVE-2022-20421 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In binder_inc_ref_for_node of binder.c, there is a possible way to corrupt memory due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-239630375References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Android Binder IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-20421` to fix the vulnerability.
