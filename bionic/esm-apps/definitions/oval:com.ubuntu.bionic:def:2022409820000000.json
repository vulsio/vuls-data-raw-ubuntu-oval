		"Title": "CVE-2022-40982 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Information exposure through microarchitectural state after transient execution in certain vector execution units for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Daniel Moghimi discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly clear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various instructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-40982` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nintel-microcode - 3.20230808.0ubuntu0.18.04.1+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-lowlatency - 4.15.0-218.229\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-aws - 4.15.0-1161.174\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-aws - 5.4.0-1108.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-gcp - 4.15.0-1155.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-gcp - 5.4.0-1111.120~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-lowlatency - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-lowlatency - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-kvm - 4.15.0-1145.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-oracle - 4.15.0-1124.135\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-oracle - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1092-raspi - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-lowlatency - 4.15.0-218.229\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-aws - 4.15.0-1161.174\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1108-aws - 5.4.0-1108.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-azure - 5.4.0-1115.122~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-gcp - 4.15.0-1155.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-gcp - 5.4.0-1111.120~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-159-lowlatency - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-generic - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-159-lowlatency - 5.4.0-159.176~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-ibm - 5.4.0-1056.61~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-oracle - 4.15.0-1124.135\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-oracle - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
