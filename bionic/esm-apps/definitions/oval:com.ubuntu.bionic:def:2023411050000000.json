If a path containing'\\0' bytes is passed to os.path.normpath(), the path will be truncatedunexpectedly at the first '\\0' byte. There are plausible cases in which anapplication would have rejected a filename for security reasons in Python3.10.x or earlier, but that filename is no longer rejected in Python3.11.x.",
