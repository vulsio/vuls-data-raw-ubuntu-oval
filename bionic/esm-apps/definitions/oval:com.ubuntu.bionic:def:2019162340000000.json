    "Title": "CVE-2019-16234 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/trans.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-16234` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1066-aws - 4.15.0-1066.70\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1017-aws - 5.3.0-1017.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-azure - 5.3.0-1020.21~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gcp - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1058-gke - 4.15.0-1058.61\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1035-gke - 5.0.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gke - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1059-kvm - 4.15.0-1059.60\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oem - 4.15.0-1080.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-oracle - 4.15.0-1038.42\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1016-oracle - 5.3.0-1016.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1061-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1061.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1023-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1023.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-99-lowlatency - 4.15.0-99.100\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1066-aws - 4.15.0-1066.70\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1020-azure - 5.3.0-1020.21~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gcp - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1058-gke - 4.15.0-1058.61\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1035-gke - 5.0.0-1035.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1018-gke - 5.3.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-generic - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-51-lowlatency - 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1080-oem - 4.15.0-1080.90\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1050.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-oracle - 4.15.0-1038.42\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1016-oracle - 5.3.0-1016.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1077.84\nNo subscription required",
