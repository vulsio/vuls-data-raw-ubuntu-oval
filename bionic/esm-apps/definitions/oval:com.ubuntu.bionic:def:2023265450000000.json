		"Title": "CVE-2023-26545 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.1.13, there is a double free in net/mpls/af_mpls.c upon an allocation failure (for registering the sysctl table under a new location) during the renaming of a device. Lianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions, leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-26545` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1154-aws - 4.15.0-1154.167\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-aws - 5.4.0-1100.108~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1163-azure - 4.15.0-1163.178\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-azure - 5.4.0-1106.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1063-dell300x - 4.15.0-1063.68\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1148-gcp - 4.15.0-1148.164\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-gcp - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-ibm - 5.4.0-1047.52~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1138-kvm - 4.15.0-1138.143\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1117-oracle - 4.15.0-1117.128\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-oracle - 5.4.0-1099.108~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1130-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1130.138\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1154-aws - 4.15.0-1154.167\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-aws - 5.4.0-1100.108~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1163-azure - 4.15.0-1163.178\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-azure - 5.4.0-1106.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1063-dell300x - 4.15.0-1063.68\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1148-gcp - 4.15.0-1148.164\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-gcp - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-ibm - 5.4.0-1047.52~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1117-oracle - 4.15.0-1117.128\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-oracle - 5.4.0-1099.108~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1148-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1148.158\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
