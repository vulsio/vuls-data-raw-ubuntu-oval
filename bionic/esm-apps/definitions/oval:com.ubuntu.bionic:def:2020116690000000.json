    "Title": "CVE-2020-11669 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2 on the powerpc platform. arch/powerpc/kernel/idle_book3s.S does not have save/restore functionality for PNV_POWERSAVE_AMR, PNV_POWERSAVE_UAMOR, and PNV_POWERSAVE_AMOR, aka CID-53a712bae5dd. David Gibson discovered that the Linux kernel on Power9 CPUs did not properly save and restore Authority Mask registers state in some situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-11669` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-101-generic - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-4.15.0-101-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-4.15.0-101-lowlatency - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-101-generic - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-101-lowlatency - 4.15.0-101.102\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1067-aws - 4.15.0-1067.71\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1016-aws - 5.3.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-azure - 4.15.0-1083.93\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1007-azure - 5.3.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1059-gke - 4.15.0-1059.62\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1037-gke - 5.0.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1060-kvm - 4.15.0-1060.61\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-oem - 4.15.0-1081.91\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1052-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1052.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1039-oracle - 4.15.0-1039.43\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1062-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1062.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1017-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1017.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-101-generic - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-4.15.0-101-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-4.15.0-101-lowlatency - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-101-generic - 4.15.0-101.102\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-101-lowlatency - 4.15.0-101.102\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1067-aws - 4.15.0-1067.71\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-azure - 4.15.0-1083.93\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1007-azure - 5.3.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1059-gke - 4.15.0-1059.62\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1037-gke - 5.0.0-1037.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-generic - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-26-lowlatency - 5.3.0-26.28~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-oem - 4.15.0-1081.91\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1052-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1052.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1039-oracle - 4.15.0-1039.43\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1079-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1079.86\nNo subscription required",
