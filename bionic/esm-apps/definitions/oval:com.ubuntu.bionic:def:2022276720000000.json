    "Title": "CVE-2022-27672 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "When SMT is enabled, certain AMD processors may speculatively execute instructions using a target from the sibling thread after an SMT mode switch potentially resulting in information disclosure. It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-27672` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-lowlatency - 4.15.0-218.229\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-aws - 4.15.0-1161.174\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-azure - 5.4.0-1113.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-gcp - 4.15.0-1155.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-kvm - 4.15.0-1145.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1091-raspi - 5.4.0-1091.102~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-generic - 4.15.0-218.229\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-218-lowlatency - 4.15.0-218.229\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-aws - 4.15.0-1161.174\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-aws - 5.4.0-1107.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1113-azure - 5.4.0-1113.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1155-gcp - 4.15.0-1155.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-gcp - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-generic - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-156-lowlatency - 5.4.0-156.173~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1054-ibm - 5.4.0-1054.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-oracle - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
