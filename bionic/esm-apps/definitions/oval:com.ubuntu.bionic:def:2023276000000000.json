		"description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDPbody is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in thesipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function withan SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\\n`). Thevulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against anOpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions`codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was alsodiscovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function`codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function`delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed(`\\n`). By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash theserver. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on theaffected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to thesanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation ofthis issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function,resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue is patched in versions 3.1.7and 3.2.4.",
