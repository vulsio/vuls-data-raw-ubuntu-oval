    "Title": "CVE-2022-26373 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Pawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan and Ariel Sabba discovered that some Intel processors with Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) did not properly handle RET instructions after a VM exits. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-26373` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-aws - 5.4.0-1086.93~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-azure - 5.4.0-1094.100~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-gcp - 5.4.0-1092.101~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-128-generic - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-128-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-128-lowlatency - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-128-generic - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-128-lowlatency - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-ibm - 5.4.0-1034.38~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-kvm - 4.15.0-1135.140\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-oracle - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1071-raspi - 5.4.0-1071.81~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1127-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1127.135\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-aws - 5.4.0-1086.93~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-azure - 5.4.0-1094.100~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-gcp - 5.4.0-1092.101~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-128-generic - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-128-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-128-lowlatency - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-128-generic - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-128-lowlatency - 5.4.0-128.144~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-ibm - 5.4.0-1034.38~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-oracle - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1145.155\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
