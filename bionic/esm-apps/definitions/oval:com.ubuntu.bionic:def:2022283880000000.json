		"Title": "CVE-2022-28388 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "usb_8dev_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/usb_8dev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has a double free. It was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-28388` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-188-generic - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-4.15.0-188-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-4.15.0-188-lowlatency - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-188-generic - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-188-lowlatency - 4.15.0-188.199\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1049-dell300x - 4.15.0-1049.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-121-generic - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-121-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-121-lowlatency - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-121-generic - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-121-lowlatency - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1123-kvm - 4.15.0-1123.128\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1066-raspi - 5.4.0-1066.76~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1115.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-188-generic - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-4.15.0-188-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-4.15.0-188-lowlatency - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-188-generic - 4.15.0-188.199\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-188-lowlatency - 4.15.0-188.199\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1049-dell300x - 4.15.0-1049.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-121-generic - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-121-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-121-lowlatency - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-121-generic - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-121-lowlatency - 5.4.0-121.137~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1133-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1133.143\nNo subscription required",
