    "Title": "CVE-2023-31436 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "qfq_change_class in net/sched/sch_qfq.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.13 allows an out-of-bounds write because lmax can exceed QFQ_MIN_LMAX. Gwangun Jung discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31436` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-aws - 4.15.0-1157.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1166-azure - 4.15.0-1166.181\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1109.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-gcp - 4.15.0-1151.167\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1050.55~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1141-kvm - 4.15.0-1141.146\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-oracle - 4.15.0-1120.131\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1102.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1086-raspi - 5.4.0-1086.97~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-generic - 4.15.0-212.223\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-212-lowlatency - 4.15.0-212.223\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-aws - 4.15.0-1157.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1166-azure - 4.15.0-1166.181\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-azure - 5.4.0-1109.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-gcp - 4.15.0-1151.167\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-gcp - 5.4.0-1106.115~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-generic - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-150-lowlatency - 5.4.0-150.167~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1050-ibm - 5.4.0-1050.55~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1120-oracle - 4.15.0-1120.131\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1102-oracle - 5.4.0-1102.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1151-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1151.161\nNo subscription required",
