    "Title": "CVE-2023-26607 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_attr_find in fs/ntfs/attrib.c. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-26607` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1136-kvm - 4.15.0-1136.141\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1081-raspi - 5.4.0-1081.92~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1128-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1128.136\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1146-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1146.156\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
