		"title": "CVE-2023-6395 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "The Mock software contains a vulnerability wherein an attacker couldpotentially exploit privilege escalation, enabling the execution ofarbitrary code with root user privileges. This weakness stems from theabsence of proper sandboxing during the expansion and execution of Jinja2templates, which may be included in certain configuration parameters. Whilethe Mock documentation advises treating users added to the mock group asprivileged, certain build systems invoking mock on behalf of users mightinadvertently permit less privileged users to define configuration tags.These tags could then be passed as parameters to mock during execution,potentially leading to the utilization of Jinja2 templates for remoteprivilege escalation and the execution of arbitrary code as the root useron the build server.",
