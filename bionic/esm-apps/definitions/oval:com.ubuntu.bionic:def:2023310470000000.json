		"Title": "CVE-2023-31047 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "In Django 3.2 before 3.2.19, 4.x before 4.1.9, and 4.2 before 4.2.1, it was possible to bypass validation when using one form field to upload multiple files. This multiple upload has never been supported by forms.FileField or forms.ImageField (only the last uploaded file was validated). However, Django's \"Uploading multiple files\" documentation suggested otherwise.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31047` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.21\npython-django-common - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.21\npython3-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.21\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
