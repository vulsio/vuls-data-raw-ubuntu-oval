    "Title": "CVE-2023-20569 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "A side channel vulnerability on some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure. Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi discovered that some AMD processors utilising speculative execution and branch prediction may allow unauthorised memory reads via a speculative side-channel attack. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-20569` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\namd64-microcode - 3.20191021.1+really3.20181128.1~ubuntu0.18.04.1+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",

This is not planned to be fixed for the amd64-microcode package in Ubuntu 14.04 as that release was already outside of the LTS timeframe when this hardware platform was launched."
