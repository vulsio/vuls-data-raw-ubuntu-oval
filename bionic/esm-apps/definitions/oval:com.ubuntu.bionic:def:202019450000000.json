    "Title": "CVE-2020-1945 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java system property java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process. It was discovered that Apache Ant created temporary files with insecure permissions. An attacker could use this vulnerability to read sensitive information leaked into /tmp, or potentially inject malicious code into a project that is built with Apache Ant.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-1945` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nant - 1.10.5-3~18.04.1~esm1\nant-optional - 1.10.5-3~18.04.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",

The fix for this CVE is incomplete. CVE-2020-11979 finishes resolving the issue."
