		"Title": "CVE-2023-3159 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A use after free issue was discovered in driver/firewire in outbound_phy_packet_callback in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with special privilege may cause a use after free problem when queue_event() fails. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3159` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1125-kvm - 4.15.0-1125.130\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1068-raspi - 5.4.0-1068.78~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
