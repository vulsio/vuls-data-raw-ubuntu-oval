		"description": "mingw-w64 version 5.0.4 by default produces executables that opt in toASLR, but are not compatible with ASLR. ASLR is an exploit mitigationtechnique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windowsexecutables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the\"Dynamic base\" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windowsexecutables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped fromthem by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 arevulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Windowsexecutables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but arenot. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as aresult.",
