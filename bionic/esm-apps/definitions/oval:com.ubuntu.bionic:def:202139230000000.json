		"Title": "CVE-2021-3923 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3923` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-aws - 4.15.0-1124.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-aws - 5.4.0-1069.73~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-azure - 4.15.0-1134.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-azure - 5.4.0-1073.76~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-dell300x - 4.15.0-1038.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-gcp - 4.15.0-1119.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gcp - 5.4.0-1068.72~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1110-kvm - 4.15.0-1110.113\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1090-oracle - 4.15.0-1090.99\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-oracle - 5.4.0-1067.72~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1056-raspi - 5.4.0-1056.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1106-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1106.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-aws - 4.15.0-1124.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-aws - 5.4.0-1069.73~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-azure - 4.15.0-1134.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-azure - 5.4.0-1073.76~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-dell300x - 4.15.0-1038.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-gcp - 4.15.0-1119.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gcp - 5.4.0-1068.72~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1090-oracle - 4.15.0-1090.99\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-oracle - 5.4.0-1067.72~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1123-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1123.132\nNo subscription required",
