    "Title": "CVE-2020-29374 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58. It was discovered that the memory management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy-on-write operations in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain unintended write access to read-only memory pages.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-29374` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-136.140\nlinux-image-4.15.0-136-lowlatency -
