		"Title": "CVE-2023-1206 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A hash collision flaw was found in the IPv6 connection lookup table in the Linux kernelâ€™s IPv6 functionality when a user makes a new kind of SYN flood attack. A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%. It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a high rate of hash collisions in connection lookup table. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive CPU consumption).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1206` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-lowlatency - 4.15.0-219.230\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-aws - 4.15.0-1162.175\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-aws - 5.4.0-1111.120~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-azure - 5.4.0-1117.124~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-gcp - 4.15.0-1156.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-gcp - 5.4.0-1115.124~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-lowlatency - 5.4.0-164.181~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-ibm - 5.4.0-1058.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1146-kvm - 4.15.0-1146.151\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-oracle - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1095-raspi - 5.4.0-1095.106~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-generic - 4.15.0-219.230\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-219-lowlatency - 4.15.0-219.230\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-aws - 4.15.0-1162.175\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1111-aws - 5.4.0-1111.120~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1117-azure - 5.4.0-1117.124~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1156-gcp - 4.15.0-1156.173\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1115-gcp - 5.4.0-1115.124~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-generic - 5.4.0-164.181~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-164-lowlatency - 5.4.0-164.181~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-ibm - 5.4.0-1058.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-oracle - 5.4.0-1110.119~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
