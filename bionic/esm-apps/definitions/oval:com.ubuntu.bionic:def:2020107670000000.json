		"Title": "CVE-2020-10767 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementationof the Enhanced IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier). The IBPBmitigation will be disabled when STIBP is not available or when theEnhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is available. Thisflaw allows a local attacker to perform a Spectre V2 style attack when thisconfiguration is active. The highest threat from this vulnerability is toconfidentiality.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10767` to fix the vulnerability.
