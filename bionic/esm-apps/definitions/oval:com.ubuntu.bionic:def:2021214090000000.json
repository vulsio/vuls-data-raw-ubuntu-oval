		"Title": "CVE-2021-21295 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly validated if the request only uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to true. This could lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix this one case. This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21409` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnetty-java - 1:4.1.7-4ubuntu0.1+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
