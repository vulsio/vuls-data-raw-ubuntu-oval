		"Title": "CVE-2022-3202 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw in diFree in fs/jfs/inode.c in Journaled File System (JFS)in the Linux kernel. This could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information. It was discovered that the Journaled File System (JFS) in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3202` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-aws - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-azure - 5.4.0-1083.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1049-dell300x - 4.15.0-1049.54\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gcp - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-ibm - 5.4.0-1028.32~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1123-kvm - 4.15.0-1123.128\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-oracle - 5.4.0-1076.83~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1065-raspi - 5.4.0-1065.75~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1115.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-aws - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-azure - 5.4.0-1083.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1049-dell300x - 4.15.0-1049.54\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gcp - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-generic - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-117-lowlatency - 5.4.0-117.132~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1028-ibm - 5.4.0-1028.32~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1076-oracle - 5.4.0-1076.83~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1133-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1133.143\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
