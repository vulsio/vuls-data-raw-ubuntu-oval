		"description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux accordingto the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internalfile descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned containerprocess (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystemnamespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the hostfilesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious imageto allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem throughrunc run (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used tooverwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete containerescapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches forthis issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-21626` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrunc - 1.1.4-0ubuntu1~18.04.2+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
