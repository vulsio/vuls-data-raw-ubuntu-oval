		"Title": "CVE-2023-2235 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel Performance Events system can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The perf_group_detach function did not check the event's siblings' attach_state before calling add_event_to_groups(), but remove_on_exec made it possible to call list_del_event() on before detaching from their group, making it possible to use a dangling pointer causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit fd0815f632c24878e325821943edccc7fde947a2. It was discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2235` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1013-raspi - 5.4.0-1013.13~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-1005-raspi2 - 4.13.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1077-snapdragon - 4.4.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required",
