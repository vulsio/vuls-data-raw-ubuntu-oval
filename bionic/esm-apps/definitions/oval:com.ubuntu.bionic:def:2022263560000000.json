		"Description": "Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirtyhypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram(was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing logdirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram canenable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing downthe structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode(XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusivelocking between both operations and can lead to entries being added inalready freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.",
