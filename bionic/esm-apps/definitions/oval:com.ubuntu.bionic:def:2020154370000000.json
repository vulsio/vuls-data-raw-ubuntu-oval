    "Title": "CVE-2020-15437 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before version 5.8 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:serial8250_isa_init_ports() that allows local users to cause a denial of service by using the p->serial_in pointer which uninitialized. It was discovered that the serial port driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a pointer in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15437` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-lowlatency -
