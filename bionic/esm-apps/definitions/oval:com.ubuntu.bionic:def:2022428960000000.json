    "Title": "CVE-2022-42896 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_connect and l2cap_le_connect_req functions which may allow code execution and leaking kernel memory (respectively) remotely via Bluetooth. A remote attacker could execute code leaking kernel memory via Bluetooth if within proximity of the victim. We recommend upgrading past commit https://www.google.com/url https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/711f8c3fb3db61897080468586b970c87c61d9e4 https://www.google.com/url Tamás Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP handshake implementation in the Linux kernel contained multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42896` to fix the vulnerability.
