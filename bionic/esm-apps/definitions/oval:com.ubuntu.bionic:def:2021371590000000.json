    "Title": "CVE-2021-37159 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free. It was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-37159` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-aws - 4.15.0-1116.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-aws - 5.4.0-1060.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-azure - 5.4.0-1064.67~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-dell300x - 4.15.0-1031.36\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-gcp - 4.15.0-1112.126\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-gcp - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gke - 5.4.0-1056.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gkeop - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-kvm - 4.15.0-1103.105\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-oracle - 4.15.0-1084.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-oracle - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1047-raspi - 5.4.0-1047.52~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1099.106\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-aws - 4.15.0-1116.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-aws - 5.4.0-1060.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-azure - 5.4.0-1064.67~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-dell300x - 4.15.0-1031.36\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-gcp - 4.15.0-1112.126\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-gcp - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gke - 5.4.0-1056.59~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gkeop - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-oracle - 4.15.0-1084.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-oracle - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1116.125\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
