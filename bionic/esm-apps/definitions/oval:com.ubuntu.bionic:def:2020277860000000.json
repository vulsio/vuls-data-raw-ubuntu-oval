    "Title": "CVE-2020-27786 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of MIDI, where an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue ioctl commands to midi devices could trigger a use-after-free issue. A write to this specific memory while freed and before use causes the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-27786` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-lowlatency - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-109-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-109-lowlatency - 4.15.0-109.110\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1077-aws - 4.15.0-1077.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-gcp - 4.15.0-1078.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1064-gke - 4.15.0-1064.67\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1043-gke - 5.0.0-1043.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1030-gke - 5.3.0-1030.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1069-kvm - 4.15.0-1069.70\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1048-oracle - 4.15.0-1048.52\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1013-raspi - 5.4.0-1013.13~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1065-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1065.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1028-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1028.30~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-4.15.0-109-lowlatency - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-109-generic - 4.15.0-109.110\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-109-lowlatency - 4.15.0-109.110\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1077-aws - 4.15.0-1077.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-aws - 5.4.0-1018.18~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1020-azure - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-gcp - 4.15.0-1078.88\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-gcp - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1064-gke - 4.15.0-1064.67\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1043-gke - 5.0.0-1043.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1030-gke - 5.3.0-1030.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-40-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-generic - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-40-lowlatency - 5.4.0-40.44~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1048-oracle - 4.15.0-1048.52\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1019-oracle - 5.4.0-1019.19~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1081-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1081.88\nNo subscription required",
