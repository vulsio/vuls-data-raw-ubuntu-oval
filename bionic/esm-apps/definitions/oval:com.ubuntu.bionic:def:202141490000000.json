		"Title": "CVE-2021-4149 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem. It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4149` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1133-aws - 4.15.0-1133.143\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-aws - 5.4.0-1061.64~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-azure - 5.4.0-1065.68~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-gcp - 4.15.0-1127.142\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-gcp - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gke - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gkeop - 5.4.0-1029.30~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1119-kvm - 4.15.0-1119.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-oracle - 4.15.0-1098.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-oracle - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1048-raspi - 5.4.0-1048.53~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1114-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1114.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-generic - 4.15.0-184.194\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-184-lowlatency - 4.15.0-184.194\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1133-aws - 4.15.0-1133.143\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-aws - 5.4.0-1061.64~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-azure - 5.4.0-1065.68~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1047-dell300x - 4.15.0-1047.52\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-gcp - 4.15.0-1127.142\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-gcp - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gke - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gkeop - 5.4.0-1029.30~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-oracle - 4.15.0-1098.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-oracle - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1132-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1132.142\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
