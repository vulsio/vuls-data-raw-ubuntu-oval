    "Title": "CVE-2023-3090 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb->cb initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled. We recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e. It was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3090` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1159.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-aws - 5.4.0-1106.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-azure - 5.4.0-1112.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1153.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-gcp - 5.4.0-1109.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-155-generic - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-155-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-155-lowlatency - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-155-generic - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-155-lowlatency - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-ibm - 5.4.0-1053.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1143.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1122.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-oracle - 5.4.0-1105.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1090-raspi - 5.4.0-1090.101~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.15.0-214.225\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.15.0-214.225\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1159.172\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-aws - 5.4.0-1106.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1112-azure - 5.4.0-1112.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1153.170\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1109-gcp - 5.4.0-1109.118~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-155-generic - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-155-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-155-lowlatency - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-155-generic - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-155-lowlatency - 5.4.0-155.172~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1053-ibm - 5.4.0-1053.58~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1122.133\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1105-oracle - 5.4.0-1105.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
