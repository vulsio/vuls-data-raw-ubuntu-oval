		"Title": "CVE-2022-2991 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVMsubsystem. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of thelength of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-lengthheap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalateprivileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Theattacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code onthe target system to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2991` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1125-kvm - 4.15.0-1125.130\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-dell300x - 4.15.0-1051.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1117-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1117.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1066-raspi - 5.4.0-1066.76~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1135.145\nNo subscription required",
