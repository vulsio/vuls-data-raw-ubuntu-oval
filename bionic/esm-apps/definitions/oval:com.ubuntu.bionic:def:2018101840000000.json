		"Title": "CVE-2018-10184 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in HAProxy before 1.8.8. The incoming H2 framelength was checked against the max_frame_size setting instead of beingchecked against the bufsize. The max_frame_size only applies to outgoingtraffic and not to incoming, so if a large enough frame size is advertisedin the SETTINGS frame, a wrapped frame will be defragmented into atemporary allocated buffer where the second fragment may overflow the heapby up to 16 kB. It is very unlikely that this can be exploited for codeexecution given that buffers are very short lived and their addresses notrealistically predictable in production, but the likelihood of an immediatecrash is absolutely certain.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10184` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhaproxy - 1.8.8-1\nvim-haproxy - 1.8.8-1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
