    "Title": "CVE-2023-4693 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found on grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue may allow a physically present attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS file system image to read arbitrary memory locations. A successful attack allows sensitive data cached in memory or EFI variable values to be leaked, presenting a high Confidentiality risk. It was discovered that a specially crafted file system image could cause an out-of-bounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to leak sensitive information to the GRUB pager.",
