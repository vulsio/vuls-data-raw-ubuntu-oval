    "Title": "CVE-2021-42252 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in aspeed_lpc_ctrl_mmap in drivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.6. Local attackers able to access the Aspeed LPC control interface could overwrite memory in the kernel and potentially execute privileges, aka CID-b49a0e69a7b1. This occurs because a certain comparison uses values that are not memory sizes. It was discovered that the Aspeed Low Pin Count (LPC) Bus Controller implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform boundary checks in some situations, allowing out-of-bounds write access. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. In Ubuntu, this issue only affected systems running armhf kernels.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-42252` to fix the vulnerability.
