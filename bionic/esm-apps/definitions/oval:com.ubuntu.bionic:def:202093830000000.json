		"Title": "CVE-2020-9383 on Ubuntu 18.04 ESM (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.5.6. set_fdc in drivers/block/floppy.c leads to a wait_til_ready out-of-bounds read because the FDC index is not checked for errors before assigning it, aka CID-2e90ca68b0d2. Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-9383` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-99.100\nlinux-image-4.15.0-99-lowlatency -
