A remote attacker could use this to perform a CSRF attack to gain access to another account. (CVE-2021-42097)  Andre Protas, Richard Cloke, and Andy Nuttall discovered that Mailman's cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens for the options page are derived from the admin password. A remote attacker could possibly use this to assist in performing a brute force attack against the admin password. (CVE-2021-42096)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5121-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  mailman - 1:2.1.26-1ubuntu0.4 No subscription required",
