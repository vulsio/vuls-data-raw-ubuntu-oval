		"description": "It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta data in some circumstances. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12655)  It was discovered that the bcache subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly release a lock in some error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12771)  Kyungtae Kim discovered that the USB testing driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory on disconnect events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-15393)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4465-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.3.0-1033-gke - 5.3.0-1033.35 linux-image-5.3.0-1033-aws - 5.3.0-1033.35 No subscription required  linux-image-5.3.0-1035-azure - 5.3.0-1035.36 No subscription required  linux-image-5.3.0-65-lowlatency - 5.3.0-65.59 linux-image-5.3.0-65-generic - 5.3.0-65.59 No subscription required  linux-image-gke-5.3 - 5.3.0.1033.18 No subscription required  linux-image-aws - 5.3.0.1033.32 No subscription required  linux-image-azure - 5.3.0.1035.31 No subscription required  linux-image-gkeop-5.3 - 5.3.0.65.121 No subscription required",
