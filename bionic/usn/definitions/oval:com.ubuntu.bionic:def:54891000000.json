		"description": "Alexander Bulekov discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled floppy disk emulation. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3507)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NVME controller emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-3929)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled QXL display device emulation. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4206, CVE-2021-4207)  Jietao Xiao, Jinku Li, Wenbo Shen, and Nanzi Yang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtiofsd shared file system daemon. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to create files with incorrect ownership, possibly leading to privilege escalation. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-0358)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled virtio-net devices. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-26353)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled vhost-vsock devices. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-26354)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5489-1` to fix the vulnerability.
