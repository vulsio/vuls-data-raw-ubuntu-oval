		"title": "USN-4115-2 -- Linux kernel regression",
		"description": "USN 4115-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux 4.15 kernel for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Unfortunately, as part of the update, a regression was introduced that caused a kernel crash when handling fragmented packets in some situations. This update addresses the issue.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the Option USB High Speed driver  in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata received from the  device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of  service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19985)   Zhipeng Xie discovered that an infinite loop could triggered in the CFS  Linux kernel process scheduler. A local attacker could possibly use this to  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-20784)   It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did  not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A  physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  (Wi-Fi disconnect). (CVE-2019-0136)   It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux  kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker  could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-10207)   Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not  sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking  protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux  devices. (CVE-2019-10638)   Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the location of kernel  addresses could be exposed by the implementation of connection-less network  protocols in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could possibly use this to  assist in the exploitation of another vulnerability in the Linux kernel.  (CVE-2019-10639)   It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when  reference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A  local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)  or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11487)   Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when  performing core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of  service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11599)   It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in  the LSI Logic MegaRAID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could  use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-11810)   It was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did  not properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A  physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-13631)   Praveen Pandey discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly validate  sent signals in some situations on PowerPC systems with transactional  memory disabled. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of  service. (CVE-2019-13648)   It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not  properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker  could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).  (CVE-2019-14283)   It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not  properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).  (CVE-2019-14284)   Tuba Yavuz discovered that a race condition existed in the DesignWare USB3  DRD Controller device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-14763)   It was discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the QLogic QEDI  iSCSI Initiator Driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly  use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15090)   It was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the  Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free.  A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15211)   It was discovered at a double-free error existed in the USB Rio 500 device  driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15212)   It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux Sound  Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a potential  use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a  denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2019-15214)   It was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux  device driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A  physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15215)   It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Softmac USB Prism54  device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could  use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15220)   It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the  AppleTalk implementation in the Linux kernel if an error occurs during  initialization. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of  service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15292)   Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the  virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could  possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.  (CVE-2019-3900)   Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered  that the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require  sufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker  could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-9506)   It was discovered that a race condition existed in the USB YUREX device  driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this  to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15216)   It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the  Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A  physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service  (system crash). (CVE-2019-15218)   It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel  did not properly validate data size information from the device. A  physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  (system crash). (CVE-2019-15221)   Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some  situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing  outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use  this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3701)   Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's  HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some  situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of  service (infinite loop). (CVE-2019-3819)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4115-2` to fix the vulnerability.
