		"description": "Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-25673)  It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-28688)  It was discovered that the fuse user space file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-28950)  Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)  Vince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell processors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)  It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28972)  It was discovered that the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver for the Linux kernel did not properly handle receive queue overrun when jumbo frames were enabled in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29264)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-29647)  Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)  马哲宇 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4982-1` to fix the vulnerability.
