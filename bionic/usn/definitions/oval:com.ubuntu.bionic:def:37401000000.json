		"description": "It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)  It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the kernel or other processes). (CVE-2018-3620)  Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5391)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3740-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1015-oem - 4.15.0-1015.18 No subscription required  linux-image-4.15.0-1017-gcp - 4.15.0-1017.18 No subscription required  linux-image-4.15.0-1019-aws - 4.15.0-1019.19 linux-image-4.15.0-1019-kvm - 4.15.0-1019.19 No subscription required  linux-image-4.15.0-1020-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1020.22 No subscription required  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1021-azure - 4.15.0-1021.21 No subscription required  linux-image-4.15.0-32-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-32.35 linux-image-4.15.0-32-lowlatency - 4.15.0-32.35 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-32-lowlatency - 4.15.0-32.35 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-32-generic - 4.15.0-32.35 linux-image-4.15.0-32-generic - 4.15.0-32.35 linux-image-4.15.0-32-snapdragon - 4.15.0-32.35 No subscription required",
