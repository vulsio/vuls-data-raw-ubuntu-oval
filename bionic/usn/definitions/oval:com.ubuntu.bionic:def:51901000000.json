		"description": "It was discovered that GraphicsMagick allowed reading arbitrary files via specially crafted images. An attacker could use this issue to expose sensitive information. This issue only affects Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-12921)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick did not correctly handle memory allocations for error messages. An attacker could use this issue to corrupt memory or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-19950)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick did not correctly handle type limits. An attacker could use these issues to cause heap-based buffer overflows, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. These issues only affect Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-19951, CVE-2019-19953)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick did not correctly handle the signed integer limit in 32-bit applications. An attacker could use this issue to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2020-10938)  It was discovered that GraphicsMagick did not properly magnify certain images. An attacker could use this issue to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12672)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5190-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libgraphics-magick-perl - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 libgraphicsmagick-q16-3 - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 libgraphicsmagick1-dev - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 graphicsmagick - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 libgraphicsmagick++-q16-12 - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 libgraphicsmagick++1-dev - 1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1+esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
