A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to use unencrypted connections. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2023-23914)  Harry Sintonen discovered that curl incorrectly handled HSTS support when multiple URLs are requested in parallel. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to use unencrypted connections. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2023-23915)  Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled memory when processing requests with multi-header compression. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2023-23916)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5891-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 libcurl3-gnutls - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 libcurl4-doc - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 libcurl3-nss - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 libcurl4 - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 curl - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.23 No subscription required",
