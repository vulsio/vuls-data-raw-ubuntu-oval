		"description": "It was discovered that the Go net/http module incorrectly handled Transfer-Encoding headers in the HTTP/1 client. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform an HTTP Request Smuggling attack. (CVE-2022-1705)  It was discovered that Go did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1962, CVE-2022-27664, CVE-2022-28131, CVE-2022-30630, CVE-2022-30631, CVE-2022-30632, CVE-2022-30633, CVE-2022-30635, CVE-2022-32189, CVE-2022-41715, CVE-2022-41717, CVE-2023-24534, CVE-2023-24537)  It was discovered that Go did not properly implemented the maximum size of file headers in Reader.Read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2022-2879)  It was discovered that the Go net/http module incorrectly handled query parameters in requests forwarded by ReverseProxy. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform an HTTP Query Parameter Smuggling attack. (CVE-2022-2880)  It was discovered that Go did not properly manage the permissions for Faccessat function. A attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29526)  It was discovered that Go did not properly generate the values for ticket_age_add in session tickets. An attacker could possibly use this issue to observe TLS handshakes to correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session resumption. (CVE-2022-30629)  It was discovered that Go did not properly manage client IP addresses in net/http. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ReverseProxy to set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header. (CVE-2022-32148)  It was discovered that Go did not properly validate backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. An attacker could possibly use this issue to inject arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. (CVE-2023-24538)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6038-1` to fix the vulnerability.
