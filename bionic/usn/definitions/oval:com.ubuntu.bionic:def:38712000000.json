		"description": "USN-3871-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Unfortunately, that update introduced regressions with docking station displays and mounting ext4 file systems with the meta_bg option enabled. This update fixes the problems.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4  filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this  to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a  denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2018-10876, CVE-2018-10879)   Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem  implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct  a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service  (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-10877)   Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the  ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use  this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a  denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2018-10878, CVE-2018-10882)   Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux  kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode  bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image  that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).  (CVE-2018-10880)   Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux  kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the  journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a  malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service  (system crash). (CVE-2018-10883)   It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family  implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free  condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to  expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). (CVE-2018-14625)   Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the  KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in  environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM  virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local  attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative  privileges in a host machine. (CVE-2018-16882)   Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the  Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel  stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose  sensitive information. (CVE-2018-17972)   Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did  not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a  physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose  sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-18281)   Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not  properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use  this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19407)   It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID  subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An  attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service  or possibly gain additional privileges. (CVE-2018-9516)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3871-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-45-generic - 4.15.0-45.48 linux-image-4.15.0-45-lowlatency - 4.15.0-45.48 linux-image-4.15.0-45-snapdragon - 4.15.0-45.48 linux-image-4.15.0-45-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-45.48 No subscription required  linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-16.04 - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-virtual-hwe-16.04 - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-16.04-edge - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-generic - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-virtual-hwe-16.04-edge - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-16.04-edge - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-16.04 - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-virtual - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-generic-hwe-16.04-edge - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-generic-lpae - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-snapdragon - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-lowlatency - 4.15.0.45.47 linux-image-generic-hwe-16.04 - 4.15.0.45.47 No subscription required",
