		"description": "It was discovered that the btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly detect that a block was marked dirty in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when unmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19377)  Tristan Madani discovered that the file locking implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-19769)  It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)  It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)  It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11608)  It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11609)  It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11668)  It was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4369-1` to fix the vulnerability.
