		"description": "USN-3816-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in systemd. However, the fix for CVE-2018-6954 was not sufficient. This update provides the remaining fixes.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Jann Horn discovered that unit_deserialize incorrectly handled status messages  above a certain length. A local attacker could potentially exploit this via  NotifyAccess to inject arbitrary state across re-execution and obtain root  privileges. (CVE-2018-15686)    Jann Horn discovered a race condition in chown_one(). A local attacker  could potentially exploit this by setting arbitrary permissions on certain  files to obtain root privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS  and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-15687)    It was discovered that systemd-tmpfiles mishandled symlinks in  non-terminal path components. A local attacker could potentially exploit  this by gaining ownership of certain files to obtain root privileges. This  issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
