		"description": "It was discovered that libmicrodns could recursively follow the same compression pointer, leading to an infinite loop. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6071)  It was discovered that libmicrodns did not check the return value of the rr_decode function, which could lead to a double free. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-6072)  It was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled certain inputs, which could lead to an integer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6073)  It was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled certain inputs, which could lead to a out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6077)  It was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled memory when parsing mDNS messages in mdns_recv, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6078)  It was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled memory, which could lead to excessive memory consumption due to memory leaks. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6079, CVE-2020-6080)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7239-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libmicrodns-dev - 0.0.8-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 libmicrodns0 - 0.0.8-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
