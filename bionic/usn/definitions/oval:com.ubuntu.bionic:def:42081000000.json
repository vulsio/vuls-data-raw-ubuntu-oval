		"description": "Jann Horn discovered that the OverlayFS and ShiftFS Drivers in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting during memory mapping operations when used in conjunction with AUFS. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15794)  Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-17133)  It was discovered that the ARM Komeda display driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-18810)  It was discovered that the VirtualBox guest driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19048)  It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19060, CVE-2019-19061)  It was discovered that the Intel OPA Gen1 Infiniband Driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19065)  It was discovered that the AMD Audio Coprocessor driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker with the ability to load modules could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19067)  It was discovered in the Qualcomm FastRPC Driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19069)  It was discovered that the Cascoda CA8210 SPI 802.15.4 wireless controller driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19075)  It was discovered that the AMD Display Engine Driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attack could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19083)  Nicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux kernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-17075)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4208-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.3.0-1009-gcp - 5.3.0-1009.10~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-gcp-edge - 5.3.0.1009.9 No subscription required",
