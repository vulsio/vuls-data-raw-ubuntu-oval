		"description": "It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16234)  It was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19051)  Tristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-19768)  It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl() calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-10942)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8648)  Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (soft lockup). (CVE-2020-8992)  Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-9383)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4344-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.0.0-1035-gke - 5.0.0-1035.36 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1050.55 No subscription required  linux-image-gke-5.0 - 5.0.0.1035.23 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0.1050.53 No subscription required",
