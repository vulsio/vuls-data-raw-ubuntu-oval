		"description": "It was discovered that Xerces-C++ was not properly handling memory management operations when parsing XML data containing external DTDs, which could trigger a use-after-free error. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XML document, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-1311)  It was discovered that Xerces-C++ was not properly performing bounds checks when processing XML Schema Definition files, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access via an HTTP request. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSD file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-37536)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6590-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libxerces-c-dev - 3.2.0+debian-2ubuntu0.1~esm3 libxerces-c3.2 - 3.2.0+debian-2ubuntu0.1~esm3 libxerces-c-samples - 3.2.0+debian-2ubuntu0.1~esm3 libxerces-c-doc - 3.2.0+debian-2ubuntu0.1~esm3 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
