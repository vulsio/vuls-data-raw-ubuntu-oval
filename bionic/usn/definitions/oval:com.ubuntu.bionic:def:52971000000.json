		"description": "Szymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain gadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39685)  Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)  Kirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-4155)  Lin Ma discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4202)  Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the aQuantia AQtion Ethernet device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data coming from the device. A local attacker who can control an emulated device can use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43975)  Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0330)  It was discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain failure conditions, leading to a stale entry in the file descriptor table. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2022-22942)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5297-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-gke-5.4-headers-5.4.0-1063 - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-image-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-modules-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-headers-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-tools-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-gke-5.4-tools-5.4.0-1063 - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1063-gke - 5.4.0-1063.66~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-gke-5.4 - 5.4.0.1063.66~18.04.27 linux-headers-gke-5.4 - 5.4.0.1063.66~18.04.27 linux-image-gke-5.4 - 5.4.0.1063.66~18.04.27 linux-tools-gke-5.4 - 5.4.0.1063.66~18.04.27 linux-modules-extra-gke-5.4 - 5.4.0.1063.66~18.04.27 No subscription required",
