		"description": "Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory allocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to potential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42703)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the memory address space accounting implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41222)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the instruction emulator of the Linux kernel on Arm 64-bit systems. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-20422)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle virtual CPUs without APICs in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2022-2153)  Hao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2978)  Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64 processors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29901)  Abhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-3028)  It was discovered that the Netlink device interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability with some network device drivers. A local attacker with admin access to the network device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3625)  It was discovered that the IDT 77252 ATM PCI device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly remove any pending timers during device exit, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3635)  Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX storage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-40768)  SÃ¶nke Huster discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42719)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5728-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-tools-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1 linux-image-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1 linux-raspi-5.4-tools-5.4.0-1074 - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1 linux-headers-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1 linux-modules-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1 linux-raspi-5.4-headers-5.4.0-1074 - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1074.73 linux-tools-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1074.73 linux-tools-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1074.73 linux-headers-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1074.73 linux-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1074.73 linux-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1074.73 linux-headers-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1074.73 linux-image-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1074.73 No subscription required",
