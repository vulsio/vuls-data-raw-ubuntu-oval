		"title": "USN-4369-2 -- Linux kernel regression",
		"description": "USN-4369-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the 5.3 Linux kernel. Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression in overlayfs. This update corrects the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not  properly detect that a block was marked dirty in some situations. An  attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when  unmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19377)   Tristan Madani discovered that the file locking implementation in the Linux  kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this  to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information.  (CVE-2019-19769)   It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel  did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose  sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)   It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain  mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker  with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial  of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)   It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux  kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).  (CVE-2020-11608)   It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux  kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).  (CVE-2020-11609)   It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the  Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically  proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system  crash). (CVE-2020-11668)   It was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race  condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could  possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute  arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4369-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.3.0-1026-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1026.28~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-raspi2-hwe-18.04 - 5.3.0.1026.15 No subscription required",
