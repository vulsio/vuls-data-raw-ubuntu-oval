		"description": "It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (Wi-Fi disconnect). (CVE-2019-0136)  It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-10207)  It was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did not properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-13631)  It was discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the QLogic QEDI iSCSI Initiator Driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15090)  Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15117)  Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the Linux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15118)  It was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15211)  It was discovered at a double-free error existed in the USB Rio 500 device driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15212)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux device driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15215)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Softmac USB Prism54 device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15220)  Benjamin Moody discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly handle an error condition when out of disk quota. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15538)  It was discovered that the Hisilicon HNS3 ethernet device driver in the Linux kernel contained an out of bounds access vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15925)  It was discovered that the Atheros mobile chipset driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15926)  Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered that the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require sufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-9506)  It was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15217)  It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15218)  It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data size information from the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15221)  It was discovered that the Line 6 USB driver for the Linux kernel contained a race condition when the device was disconnected. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15223)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4147-1` to fix the vulnerability.
