		"title": "USN-4516-1 -- GnuPG vulnerability",
		"description": "It was discovered that GnuPG signatures could be forged when the SHA-1 algorithm is being used. This update removes validating signatures based on SHA-1 that were generated after 2019-01-19. In environments where this is still required, a new option --allow-weak-key-signatures can be used to revert this behaviour.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4516-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  dirmngr - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpgv-static - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gnupg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 scdaemon - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpgsm - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpgv - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gnupg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gnupg2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gnupg-l10n - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpgv-udeb - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gnupg-utils - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpg-wks-server - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpgv-win32 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpg-wks-client - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpgconf - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 gpgv2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.3 No subscription required",
