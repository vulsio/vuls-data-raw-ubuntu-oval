		"description": "It was discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd were vulnerable to a side channel attack against EAP-pwd. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover certain passwords. (CVE-2019-9495)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that wpa_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly validated received scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a reflection attack and authenticate without the appropriate password. (CVE-2019-9497, CVE-2019-9498, CVE-2019-9499)  It was discovered that hostapd incorrectly handled obtaining random numbers. In rare cases where the urandom device isn't available, it would fall back to using a low-quality PRNG. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-10743)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3944-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  hostapd - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.2 wpagui - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.2 wpasupplicant-udeb - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.2 wpasupplicant - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.2 No subscription required",
