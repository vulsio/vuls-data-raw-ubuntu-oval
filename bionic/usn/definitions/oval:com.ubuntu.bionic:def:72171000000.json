		"description": "It was discovered that the PoDoFo library could dereference a NULL pointer when getting the number of pages in a PDF. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-11255)  It was discovered that PoDoFo library incorrectly handled memory when computing an encryption key, which could lead to a buffer overflow. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-12983)  It was discovered that the PoDoFo library incorrectly handled memory allocation. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-20797)  It was discovered that the PoDoFo library did not properly validate memcpy arguments. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-5308)  It was discovered that the PoDoFo library incorrectly handled memory in the GetNextToken function, which could lead to a buffer overflow. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2017-5886)  It was discovered that the PoDoFo library could enter an infinite loop, which could lead to a stack overflow. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-8002, CVE-2020-18971, CVE-2021-30471, CVE-2021-30470)  It was discovered that the PoDoFo library incorrectly handled memory allocation due to nInitialSize not being validated. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-10723)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7217-1` to fix the vulnerability.
