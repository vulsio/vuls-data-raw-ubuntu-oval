		"description": "USN-3977-1 and USN-3977-2 provided mitigations for Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) vulnerabilities in Intel Microcode for a large number of Intel processor families. This update provides the corresponding updated microcode mitigations for the Intel Sandy Bridge processor family  Ke Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Giorgi Maisuradze, Dan Horea Lutas, Andrei Lutas, Volodymyr Pikhur, Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, and Daniel Gruss discovered that memory previously stored in microarchitectural fill buffers of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-12130)  Brandon Falk, Ke Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that memory previously stored in microarchitectural load ports of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-12127)  Ke Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Marina Minkin, Daniel Moghimi, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Jo Van Bulck, Daniel Genkin, Daniel Gruss, Berk Sunar, Frank Piessens, and Yuval Yarom discovered that memory previously stored in microarchitectural store buffers of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-12126)  Ke Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Volodrmyr Pikhur, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that uncacheable memory previously stored in microarchitectural buffers of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11091)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3977-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  intel-microcode - 3.20190618.0ubuntu0.18.04.1 No subscription required",
