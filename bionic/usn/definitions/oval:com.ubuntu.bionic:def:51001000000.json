		"description": "It was discovered that containerd insufficiently restricted permissions on container root and plugin directories. If a user or automated system were tricked into launching a specially crafted container image, a remote attacker could traverse directory contents and modify files and execute programs on the host filesystem, possibly leading to privilege escalation.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5100-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  containerd - 1.5.2-0ubuntu1~18.04.3 golang-github-docker-containerd-dev - 1.5.2-0ubuntu1~18.04.3 golang-github-containerd-containerd-dev - 1.5.2-0ubuntu1~18.04.3 No subscription required",
