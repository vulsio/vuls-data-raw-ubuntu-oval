		"description": "It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing Vim buffers. An       attacker could possibly use this issue to perform illegal memory access and expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-4166)  It was discovered that Vim was using freed memory when dealing with regular expressions inside a visual selection. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution with user privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-4192)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling virtual column position operations, which could result in an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-4193)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks when updating windows present on a screen, which could result in a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0213)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing read and write operations when in visual block mode, going beyond the end of a line and causing a heap buffer overflow. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution with user privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-0261, CVE-2022-0318)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling window exchanging operations when in Visual mode, which could result in an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0319)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling recursion when parsing conditional expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0351)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly handling memory allocation when processing data in Ex mode, which could result in a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0359)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks when executing line operations in Visual mode, which could result in a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-0361, CVE-2022-0368)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly handling loop conditions when looking for spell suggestions, which could result in a stack buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0408)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling memory access when executing buffer operations, which could result in the usage of freed memory. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0443)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing Vim buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform illegal memory access and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0554)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks for column numbers when replacing tabs with spaces or spaces with tabs, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0572)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing Vim buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform illegal memory access and expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-0629)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing validation of data that contained special multi-byte characters, which could cause an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0685)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing data used to define indentation in a file, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0714)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing certain regular expression patterns and strings, which could cause an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0729)  It was discovered that Vim incorrectly handled memory access. An attacker could potentially use this issue to cause the corruption of sensitive information, a crash, or arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2022-2207)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6026-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  vim-common - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-gnome - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-athena - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 xxd - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-gtk - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-gui-common - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-doc - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-tiny - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-runtime - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-gtk3 - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 vim-nox - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.13 No subscription required",
