		"description": "Gaoning Pan discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the floppy disk emulator. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-20196)  Gaoning Pan discovered that the QEMU vmxnet3 NIC emulator incorrectly handled certain values. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-20203)  It was discovered that the QEMU vhost-user GPU device contained several security issues. An attacker inside the guest could use these issues to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, leak sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-3544, CVE-2021-3545, CVE-2021-3546)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled bulk transfers from SPICE clients. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3682)  It was discovered that the QEMU UAS device emulation incorrectly handled certain stream numbers. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-3713)  It was discovered that the QEMU virtio-net device incorrectly handled certain buffer addresses. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2021-3748)  It was discovered that the QEMU SCSI device emulation incorrectly handled certain MODE SELECT commands. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3930)  It was discovered that the QEMU ACPI logic incorrectly handled certain values. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-4158)  Jietao Xiao, Jinku Li, Wenbo Shen, and Nanzi Yang discovered that the QEMU virtiofsd device incorrectly handled permissions when creating files. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to create files inside the directory shared by virtiofs with unintended permissions, possibly allowing privilege escalation. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.10. (CVE-2022-0358)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5307-1` to fix the vulnerability.
