		"description": "Marcus Brinkmann discovered that GnuPG before 2.2.8 improperly handled certain command line parameters. A remote attacker could use this to spoof the output of GnuPG and cause unsigned e-mail to appear signed. (CVE-2018-12020)  It was discovered that python-gnupg incorrectly handled the GPG passphrase. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted passphrase that would allow them to control the output of encryption and decryption operations. (CVE-2019-6690)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3964-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python3-gnupg - 0.4.1-1ubuntu1.18.04.1 python-gnupg - 0.4.1-1ubuntu1.18.04.1 No subscription required",
