		"description": "It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain malformed gzip archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted gzip archive, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause BusyBox to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-28831)  It was discovered that BusyBox did not properly validate user input when performing certain arithmetic operations.
