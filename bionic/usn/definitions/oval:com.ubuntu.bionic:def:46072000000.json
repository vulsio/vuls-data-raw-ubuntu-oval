		"description": "USN-4607-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added features in OpenJDK. Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression that could cause TLS connections with client certificate authentication to fail in some situations. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled deserializing Proxy  class objects with many interfaces. A remote attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a  specially crafted input. (CVE-2020-14779)    Sergey Ostanin discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly restricted  authentication mechanisms. A remote attacker could possibly use this  issue to obtain sensitive information over an unencrypted connection.  (CVE-2020-14781)    It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled untrusted certificates.  An attacker could possibly use this issue to read or write sensitive  information. (CVE-2020-14782)    Zhiqiang Zang discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked for integer  overflows. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain  Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14792)    Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked permissions when  converting a file system path to an URI. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14796)    Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked for invalid  characters when converting an URI to a path. An attacker could possibly  use this issue to read or write sensitive information. (CVE-2020-14797)    Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked the length of  input strings. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain  Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14798)    It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled boundary checks. An  attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain Java sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2020-14803)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4607-2` to fix the vulnerability.
