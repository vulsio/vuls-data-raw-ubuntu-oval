		"description": "USN-4247-1 fixed vulnerabilities in python-apt. The updated packages caused a regression when attempting to upgrade to a new Ubuntu release. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that python-apt would still use MD5 hashes to validate  certain downloaded packages. If a remote attacker were able to perform a  machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to install  altered packages. (CVE-2019-15795)    It was discovered that python-apt could install packages from untrusted  repositories, contrary to expectations. (CVE-2019-15796)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4247-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python3-apt - 1.6.5ubuntu0.2 python-apt - 1.6.5ubuntu0.2 python-apt-common - 1.6.5ubuntu0.2 python-apt-dev - 1.6.5ubuntu0.2 python-apt-doc - 1.6.5ubuntu0.2 No subscription required",
