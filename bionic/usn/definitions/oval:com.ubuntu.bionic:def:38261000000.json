		"description": "Daniel Shapira and Arash Tohidi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NE2000 device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-10839)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Slirp networking back-end. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-11806)  Fakhri Zulkifli discovered that the QEMU guest agent incorrectly handled certain QMP commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to crash the QEMU guest agent, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-12617)  Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NVM Express Controller emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-16847)  Daniel Shapira and Arash Tohidi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled RTL8139 device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-17958)  Daniel Shapira and Arash Tohidi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled PCNET device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-17962)  Daniel Shapira discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled large packet sizes. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-17963)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled LSI53C895A device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-18849)  Moguofang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the IPowerNV LPC controller. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-18954)  Zhibin Hu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Plan 9 File System support. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2018-19364)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3826-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  qemu-system-common - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-user-static - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system-s390x - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-block-extra - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-kvm - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-user - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-guest-agent - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-utils - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-user-binfmt - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system-x86 - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system-arm - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system-misc - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system-sparc - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system-ppc - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 qemu-system-mips - 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.8 No subscription required",
