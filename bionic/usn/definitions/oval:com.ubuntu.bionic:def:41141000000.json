		"description": "Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux devices. (CVE-2019-10638)  Praveen Pandey discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly validate sent signals in some situations on PowerPC systems with transactional memory disabled. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-13648)  It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-14283)  It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-14284)  Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system. (CVE-2019-3900)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4114-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.0.0-1015-gke - 5.0.0-1015.15~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-1018-azure - 5.0.0-1018.19~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-27-lowlatency - 5.0.0-27.28~18.04.1 linux-image-5.0.0-27-generic - 5.0.0-27.28~18.04.1 linux-image-5.0.0-27-generic-lpae - 5.0.0-27.28~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-gke-5.0 - 5.0.0.1015.5 No subscription required  linux-image-azure - 5.0.0.1018.28 No subscription required  linux-image-snapdragon-hwe-18.04 - 5.0.0.27.84 linux-image-virtual-hwe-18.04 - 5.0.0.27.84 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-18.04 - 5.0.0.27.84 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-18.04 - 5.0.0.27.84 linux-image-generic-hwe-18.04 - 5.0.0.27.84 No subscription required",
