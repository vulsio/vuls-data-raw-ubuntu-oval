		"description": "USN-4134-1 fixed a vulnerability in IBus. The update caused a regression in some Qt applications and the fix was subsequently reverted in USN-4134-2. The regression has since been resolved and so this update fixes the original vulnerability.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Simon McVittie discovered that IBus did not enforce appropriate access  controls on its private D-Bus socket. A local unprivileged user who  discovers the IBus socket address of another user could exploit this to  capture the key strokes of the other user.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4134-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ibus-gtk - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 ibus-wayland - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 ibus - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 libibus-1.0-5 - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 gir1.2-ibus-1.0 - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 libibus-1.0-dev - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 ibus-gtk3 - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 ibus-doc - 1.5.17-3ubuntu5.3 No subscription required",
