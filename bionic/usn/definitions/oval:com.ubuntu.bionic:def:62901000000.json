		"title": "USN-6290-1 -- LibTIFF vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that LibTIFF could be made to write out of bounds when processing certain malformed image files with the tiffcrop utility. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause tiffcrop to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-48281)  It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-2731)  It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain image files with the tiffcp utility. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause tiffcp to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2023-2908)  It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain file paths. If a user were tricked into specifying certain output paths, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-3316)  It was discovered that LibTIFF could be made to write out of bounds when processing certain malformed image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3618)  It was discovered that LibTIFF could be made to write out of bounds when processing certain malformed image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-25433, CVE-2023-26966)  It was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly managed memory when processing certain malformed image files with the tiffcrop utility. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause tiffcrop to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-26965)  It was discovered that LibTIFF contained an arithmetic overflow. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-38288, CVE-2023-38289)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6290-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libtiff-opengl - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm2 libtiffxx5 - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm2 libtiff5-dev - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm2 libtiff-dev - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm2 libtiff5 - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm2 libtiff-tools - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm2 libtiff-doc - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
