		"description": "It was discovered that the F2FS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking on xattrs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-0067)  It was discovered that memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY read operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly exposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0543)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that race conditions existed in the file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12114)  It was discovered that the USB susbsystem's scatter-gather implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly take data references in some situations, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12464)  Bui Quang Minh discovered that the XDP socket implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data passed from user space, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12659)  Xiumei Mu discovered that the IPSec implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly encrypt IPv6 traffic in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-1749)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4388-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.0.0-1042-gke - 5.0.0-1042.43 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-1059-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1059.64 No subscription required  linux-image-gke-5.0 - 5.0.0.1042.27 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0.1059.58 No subscription required",
