		"description": "Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel could improperly let a nested (level 2) guest access the resources of a parent (level 1) guest in certain situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-2732)  Gregory Herrero discovered that the fix for CVE-2019-14615 to address the Linux kernel not properly clearing data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors was incomplete. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8832)  It was discovered that the IPMI message handler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19046)  It was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19051)  It was discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19056)  It was discovered that the Intel(R) Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19058)  It was discovered that the Brocade BFA Fibre Channel device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19066)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8xxx USB Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19068)  It was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15217)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4302-1` to fix the vulnerability.
