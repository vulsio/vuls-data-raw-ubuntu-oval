		"description": "It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly performed input verification. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to intercept sensitive information. (CVE-2020-13943, CVE-2020-17527, CVE-2021-25122, CVE-2021-30640)  It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly deserialize untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-9484, CVE-2021-33037)  It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly validate the input length. An attacker could possibly use this to trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-25329, CVE-2021-41079)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5360-1` to fix the vulnerability.
