		"description": "Jesse Michael and Mickey Shkatov discovered that the configuration parser in GRUB2 did not properly exit when errors were discovered, resulting in heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-10713)  Chris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not properly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-15706)  Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2 when handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311)  It was discovered that the memory allocator for GRUB2 did not validate allocation size, resulting in multiple integer overflows and heap-based buffer overflows when handling certain filesystems, PNG images or disk metadata. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-14308)  Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre discovered that in certain situations, GRUB2 failed to validate kernel signatures. A local attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-15705)  Colin Watson and Chris Coulson discovered that an integer overflow existed in GRUB2 when handling the initrd command, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-15707)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4432-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  grub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.93.18+2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.93.18+2.02-2ubuntu8.16 No subscription required  grub-ieee1275 - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-amd64 - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub2-common - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-uboot-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-common - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-firmware-qemu - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-theme-starfield - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-arm - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-coreboot-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub2 - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-xen-host - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-pc - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-emu - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-arm-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-linuxbios - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-xen - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-uboot - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-ia32 - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-coreboot - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-ia32-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-ieee1275-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-xen-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-rescue-pc - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-mount-udeb - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-pc-bin - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi-arm64 - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 grub-efi - 2.02-2ubuntu8.16 No subscription required",
