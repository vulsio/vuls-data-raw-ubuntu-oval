Original advisory details:   James Kettle discovered that the Apache HTTP Server HTTP/2 module  incorrectly handled certain crafted methods. A remote attacker could  possibly use this issue to perform request splitting or cache poisoning  attacks. (CVE-2021-33193)    It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled certain  malformed requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to  cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.  (CVE-2021-34798)    Li Zhi Xin discovered that the Apache mod_proxy_uwsgi module incorrectly  handled certain request uri-paths. A remote attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.  This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 21.04.  (CVE-2021-36160)    It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled escaping  quotes.

(CVE-2021-39275)    It was discovered that the Apache mod_proxy module incorrectly handled  certain request uri-paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue  to cause the server to forward requests to arbitrary origin servers.
