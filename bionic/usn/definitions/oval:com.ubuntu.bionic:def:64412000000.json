		"description": "Ross Lagerwall discovered that the Xen netback backend driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain unusual packets from a paravirtualized network frontend, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-34319)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the networking stack implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate skb object size in certain conditions. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42752)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate array offsets, leading to a out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42753)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). Please note that kernel packet classifier support for RSVP has been removed to resolve this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-42755)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in IP set operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42756)  Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered that the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4622)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inner classes, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4623)  Alex Birnberg discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate register length, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4881)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packets in certain conditions, leading to a use after free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4921)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6441-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-headers-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-modules-extra-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-tools-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-gcp-5.4-tools-5.4.0-1116 - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-modules-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-gcp-5.4-headers-5.4.0-1116 - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 linux-image-5.4.0-1116-gcp - 5.4.0-1116.125~18.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-headers-gcp-edge - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-tools-gcp - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-modules-extra-gcp-edge - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-image-gcp - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-modules-extra-gcp - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-tools-gcp-edge - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-gcp-edge - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-gcp - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-headers-gcp - 5.4.0.1116.92 linux-image-gcp-edge - 5.4.0.1116.92 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
