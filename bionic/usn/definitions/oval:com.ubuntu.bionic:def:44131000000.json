		"description": "Matthew Sheets discovered that the SELinux network label handling implementation in the Linux kernel could be coerced into de-referencing a NULL pointer. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-10711)  It was discovered that the SCSI generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions correctly. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12770)  It was discovered that the USB Gadget device driver in the Linux kernel did not validate arguments passed from configfs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-13143)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the SELinux netlink security hook in the Linux kernel did not validate messages in some situations. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions. (CVE-2020-10751)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory on initialization for some processors. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12768)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4413-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.0.0-1043-gke - 5.0.0-1043.44 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-1063-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1063.68 No subscription required  linux-image-gke-5.0 - 5.0.0.1043.28 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0.1063.61 No subscription required",
