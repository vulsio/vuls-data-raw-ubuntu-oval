		"description": "It was discovered that Vim incorrectly handled permissions on the .swp file. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2017-17087)  It was discovered that Vim incorrectly handled restricted mode. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass restricted mode and execute arbitrary commands. Note: This update only makes executing shell commands more difficult. Restricted mode should not be considered a complete security measure. (CVE-2019-20807)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4582-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  vim-common - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-gnome - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-athena - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-tiny - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-gtk - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-gui-common - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-doc - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 xxd - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-runtime - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-gtk3 - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 vim-nox - 2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.4 No subscription required",
