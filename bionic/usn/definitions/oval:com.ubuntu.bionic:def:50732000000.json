		"description": "Maxim Levitsky and Paolo Bonzini discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel allowed a guest VM to disable restrictions on VMLOAD/VMSAVE in a nested guest. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to read or write portions of the host's physical memory. (CVE-2021-3656)  Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent a guest VM from enabling AVIC in nested guest VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to write to portions of the host's physical memory. (CVE-2021-3653)  Norbert Slusarek discovered that the CAN broadcast manger (bcm) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-34693)  Murray McAllister discovered that the joystick device interface in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data passed via an ioctl(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on systems with a joystick device registered. (CVE-2021-3612)  It was discovered that the Virtio console implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate input lengths in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-38160)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5073-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-headers-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-image-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-gcp-4.15-tools-4.15.0-1108 - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-gcp-4.15-headers-4.15.0-1108 - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-tools-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122 linux-modules-4.15.0-1108-gcp - 4.15.0-1108.122 No subscription required  linux-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1108.127 linux-modules-extra-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1108.127 linux-tools-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1108.127 linux-headers-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1108.127 linux-image-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1108.127 No subscription required",
