		"description": "Ofek Kirzner, Adam Morrison, Benedict Schlueter, and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel missed possible mispredicted branches due to type confusion, allowing a side-channel attack. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-33624)  It was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)  It was discovered that the Virtio console implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate input lengths in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-38160)  Michael Wakabayashi discovered that the NFSv4 client implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly order connection setup operations. An attacker controlling a remote NFS server could use this to cause a denial of service on the client. (CVE-2021-38199)  It was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-38204)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5091-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-raspi-5.4-headers-5.4.0-1044 - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1 linux-modules-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1 linux-headers-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1 linux-raspi-5.4-tools-5.4.0-1044 - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1 linux-tools-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1 linux-image-5.4.0-1044-raspi - 5.4.0-1044.48~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1044.47 linux-headers-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1044.47 linux-image-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1044.47 linux-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1044.47 linux-headers-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1044.47 linux-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1044.47 linux-tools-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1044.47 linux-tools-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1044.47 No subscription required",
