		"title": "USN-4504-1 -- OpenSSL vulnerabilities",
		"description": "Robert Merget, Marcus Brinkmann, Nimrod Aviram, and Juraj Somorovsky discovered that certain Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites in the TLS specification and implemented by OpenSSL contained a flaw. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to eavesdrop on encrypted communications. This was fixed in this update by removing the insecure ciphersuites from OpenSSL. (CVE-2020-1968)  Cesar Pereida Garc√≠a, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri, Iaroslav Gridin, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Brumley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ECDSA signatures. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a timing side-channel attack and recover private ECDSA keys. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1547)  Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover private keys. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1551)  Bernd Edlinger discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain decryption functions. In certain scenarios, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle attack and decrypt traffic. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1563)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4504-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.4 openssl1.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.4 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.4 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.4 libssl1.0-dev - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.4 No subscription required",
