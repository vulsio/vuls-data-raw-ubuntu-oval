		"title": "USN-5727-2 -- Linux kernel (GCP) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the instruction emulator of the Linux kernel on Arm 64-bit systems. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-20422)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle virtual CPUs without APICs in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2022-2153)  Hao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2978)  Abhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-3028)  It was discovered that the IDT 77252 ATM PCI device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly remove any pending timers during device exit, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3635)  It was discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36879)  Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX storage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-40768)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5727-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-modules-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-gcp-4.15-tools-4.15.0-1138 - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-image-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-headers-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-tools-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-gcp-4.15-headers-4.15.0-1138 - 4.15.0-1138.154 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154 No subscription required  linux-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1138.154 linux-modules-extra-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1138.154 linux-tools-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1138.154 linux-headers-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1138.154 linux-image-gcp-lts-18.04 - 4.15.0.1138.154 No subscription required",
