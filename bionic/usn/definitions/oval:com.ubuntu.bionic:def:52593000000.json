We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the postinst maintainer script in Cron unsafely  handled file permissions during package install or update operations.  An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a privilege  escalation attack.

An attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-9704)    It was discovered that Cron incorrectly handled user input during crontab  file creation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial  of service. (CVE-2019-9705)    It was discovered that Cron contained a use-after-free vulnerability in  its force_rescan_user function.
