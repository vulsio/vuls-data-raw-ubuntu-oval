		"description": "It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15099)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2019-18683)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-18885)  It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19050, CVE-2019-19062)  It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19071)  It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19077)  It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19078)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router TUN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19079)  It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19082)  Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19227)  Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or have other unspecified impacts. (CVE-2019-19252)  It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19332)  It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19767)  It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15291)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4258-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.0.0-1010-oracle - 5.0.0-1010.15~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-1024-aws - 5.0.0-1024.27~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-1029-gke - 5.0.0-1029.30~18.04.1 linux-image-5.0.0-1029-gcp - 5.0.0-1029.30~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-oracle-edge - 5.0.0.1010.9 No subscription required  linux-image-aws-edge - 5.0.0.1024.38 No subscription required  linux-image-gke-5.0 - 5.0.0.1029.17 No subscription required  linux-image-gcp - 5.0.0.1029.33 No subscription required",
