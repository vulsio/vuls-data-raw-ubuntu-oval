		"description": "Al Viro discovered that the Linux kernel for s390x systems did not properly perform page table upgrades for kernel sections that use secondary address mode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-11884)  It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16234)  Tristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-19768)  It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl() calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-10942)  It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11608)  It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11609)  It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11668)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8648)  Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-9383)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4345-1` to fix the vulnerability.
