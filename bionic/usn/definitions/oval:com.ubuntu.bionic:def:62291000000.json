		"title": "USN-6229-1 -- LibTIFF vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly handling variables used to perform memory management operations when processing an image through tiffcrop, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25433, CVE-2023-26965)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly processing numerical values when dealing with little-endian input data, which could lead to the execution of an invalid operation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (CVE-2023-26966)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing bounds checks when closing a previously opened TIFF file, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-3316)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6229-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libtiff-opengl - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm1 libtiffxx5 - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm1 libtiff5-dev - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm1 libtiff-dev - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm1 libtiff5 - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm1 libtiff-tools - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm1 libtiff-doc - 4.0.9-5ubuntu0.10+esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
