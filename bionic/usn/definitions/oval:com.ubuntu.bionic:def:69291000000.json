		"description": "It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 was not properly performing bounds when handling certain UTF-8 strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-21131)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 could be made to run into an infinite loop. If an automated system were tricked into processing excessively large symbols, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-21138)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not properly perform range check elimination. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2024-21140)  Yakov Shafranovich discovered that the Concurrency component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly performed header validation in the Pack200 archive format. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-21144)  Sergey Bylokhov discovered that OpenJDK 8 did not properly manage memory when handling 2D images. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2024-21145)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly handled memory when performing range check elimination under certain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2024-21147)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6929-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-8-demo - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 openjdk-8-doc - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 openjdk-8-jdk - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 openjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 openjdk-8-jre - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 openjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 openjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 openjdk-8-source - 8u422-b05-1~18.04 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
