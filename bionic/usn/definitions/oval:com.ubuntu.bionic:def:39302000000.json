		"description": "USN-3930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.10. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.10 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.  Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19824)  Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460)  Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM crash). (CVE-2019-6974)  Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system. (CVE-2019-7221)  Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host system memory to a guest VM). (CVE-2019-7222)  Jann Horn discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel was insufficiently hardened against Spectre V1 attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-7308)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the user- space API for crypto (af_alg) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-8912)  Jakub Jirasek discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-8956)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory when handling certain errors while reading files. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption). (CVE-2019-8980)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IPMI implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to the IPMI character device files could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-9003)  Jann Horn discovered that the SNMP NAT implementation in the Linux kernel performed insufficient ASN.1 length checks. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-9162)  Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. (CVE-2019-9213)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3930-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.18.0-1014-azure - 4.18.0-1014.14~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-4.18.0-17-snapdragon - 4.18.0-17.18~18.04.1 linux-image-4.18.0-17-generic-lpae - 4.18.0-17.18~18.04.1 linux-image-4.18.0-17-generic - 4.18.0-17.18~18.04.1 linux-image-4.18.0-17-lowlatency - 4.18.0-17.18~18.04.1 No subscription required  linux-image-azure - 4.18.0.1014.13 No subscription required  linux-image-snapdragon-hwe-18.04 - 4.18.0.17.67 linux-image-lowlatency-hwe-18.04 - 4.18.0.17.67 linux-image-generic-lpae-hwe-18.04 - 4.18.0.17.67 linux-image-virtual-hwe-18.04 - 4.18.0.17.67 linux-image-generic-hwe-18.04 - 4.18.0.17.67 No subscription required",
