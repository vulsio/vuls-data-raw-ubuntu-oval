		"description": "It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled bulk transfers from SPICE clients. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-3682)  It was discovered that QEMU did not properly manage memory when it transfers the USB packets. A malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-3750)  It was discovered that the QEMU SCSI device emulation incorrectly handled certain MODE SELECT commands. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-3930)  It was discovered that QEMU did not properly manage memory when it processing repeated messages to cancel the current SCSI request. A malicious privileged guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0216)  It was discovered that QEMU did not properly manage memory when it using Tulip device emulation. A malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-2962)  It was discovered that QEMU did not properly manage memory when processing ClientCutText messages. A attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-3165)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5772-1` to fix the vulnerability.
