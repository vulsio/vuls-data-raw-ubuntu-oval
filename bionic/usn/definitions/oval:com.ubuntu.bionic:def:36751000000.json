		"title": "USN-3675-1 -- GnuPG vulnerabilities",
		"description": "Marcus Brinkmann discovered that during decryption or verification, GnuPG did not properly filter out terminal sequences when reporting the original filename. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file that would cause an application parsing GnuPG output to incorrectly interpret the status of the cryptographic operation reported by GnuPG. (CVE-2018-12020)  Lance Vick discovered that GnuPG did not enforce configurations where key certification required an offline primary Certify key. An attacker with access to a signing subkey could generate certifications that appeared to be valid. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-9234)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3675-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  dirmngr - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpgv-static - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gnupg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 scdaemon - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpgsm - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpgv - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gnupg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gnupg2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gnupg-l10n - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpgv-udeb - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gnupg-utils - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpg-wks-server - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpgv-win32 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpg-wks-client - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpgconf - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 gpgv2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1 No subscription required",
