		"description": "Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-25673)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28660)  Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)  Vince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell processors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)  It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28972)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-29647)  Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)  It was discovered that the CIPSO implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to use- after-free vulnerabilities. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33033)  Wolfgang Frisch discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow when handling metadata inode extents. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-3428)  马哲宇 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
