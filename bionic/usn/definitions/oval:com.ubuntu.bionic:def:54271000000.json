		"description": "Muqing Liu and neoni discovered that Apport incorrectly handled detecting if an executable was replaced after a crash. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code as the root user. (CVE-2021-3899)  Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled connections to Apport sockets inside containers. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to connect to arbitrary sockets as the root user. (CVE-2022-1242)  Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled user settings files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28652)  Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of logging from D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to fill up the Apport log file, leading to denial of service. (CVE-2022-28654)  Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not filter D-Bus connection strings. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to make arbitrary network connections. (CVE-2022-28655)  Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of memory being consumed during D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to consume memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28656)  Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not disable the python crash handler before chrooting into a container. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-28657)  Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled filename argument whitespace. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof arguments to the Apport daemon. (CVE-2022-28658)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5427-1` to fix the vulnerability.
