		"description": "It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for error conditions in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16089)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate file system metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19036)  It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check return values in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19462)  Chuhong Yuan discovered that go7007 USB audio device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some failure conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20810)  It was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-10732)  Fan Yang discovered that the mremap implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle DAX Huge Pages. A local attacker with access to DAX storage could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2020-10757)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) mitigations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-10766)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) mitigations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-10767)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel could incorrectly enable Indirect Branch Speculation after it has been disabled for a process via a prctl() call. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-10768)  Mauricio Faria de Oliveira discovered that the aufs implementation in the Linux kernel improperly managed inode reference counts in the vfsub_dentry_open() method. A local attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-11935)  It was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use this to have an unspecified impact. (CVE-2020-13974)  It was discovered that the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel did not handle memory allocation failures during early boot in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-12380)  Jason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict loading SSDT code from an EFI variable. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown restrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel. (CVE-2019-20908)  Jason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict loading ACPI tables via configfs. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown restrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel. (CVE-2020-15780)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4439-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-5.0.0-1045-gke - 5.0.0-1045.46 No subscription required  linux-image-5.0.0-1065-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1065.70 No subscription required  linux-image-gke-5.0 - 5.0.0.1045.30 No subscription required  linux-image-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0.1065.63 No subscription required",
