		"description": "It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly validate types in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a Java class that could possibly bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2825, CVE-2018-2826)  It was discovered that the PatternSyntaxException class in OpenJDK did not properly validate arguments passed to it. An attacker could use this to potentially construct a class that caused a denial of service (excessive memory consumption). (CVE-2018-2952)  Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered a vulnerability in the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) mode of operation for symmetric block ciphers in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-2972)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3747-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-11-doc - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 openjdk-11-jre-zero - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 openjdk-11-source - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 openjdk-11-jre-headless - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 openjdk-11-jdk - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 openjdk-11-jdk-headless - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 openjdk-11-jre - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 openjdk-11-demo - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1 No subscription required",
