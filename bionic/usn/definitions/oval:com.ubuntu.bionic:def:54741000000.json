		"description": "It was dicovered that Varnish Cache did not clear a pointer between the handling of one client request and the next request within the same connection. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-20637)  It was discovered that Varnish Cache could have an assertion failure when a TLS termination proxy uses PROXY version 2. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to restart the daemon and cause a performance loss. (CVE-2020-11653)  It was discovered that Varnish Cache allowed request smuggling and VCL authorization bypass via a large Content-Length header for a POST request. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2021-36740)  It was discovered that Varnish Cache allowed request smuggling for HTTP/1 connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-23959)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5474-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  varnish - 5.2.1-1ubuntu0.1 varnish-doc - 5.2.1-1ubuntu0.1 libvarnishapi-dev - 5.2.1-1ubuntu0.1 libvarnishapi1 - 5.2.1-1ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
