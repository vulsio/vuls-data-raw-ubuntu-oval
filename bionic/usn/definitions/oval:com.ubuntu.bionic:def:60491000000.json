(CVE-2021-37136)  It was discovered that Netty's Snappy frame decoder function did not limit chunk lengths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Netty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2021-37137)  It was discovered that Netty did not properly handle control chars at the beginning and end of header names. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to smuggle requests. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-43797)  It was discovered that Netty could be made into an infinite recursion when parsing a malformed crafted message. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Netty to crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-41881)  It was discovered that Netty did not validate header values under certain circumstances. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform HTTP response splitting via malicious header values. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-41915)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6049-1` to fix the vulnerability.
