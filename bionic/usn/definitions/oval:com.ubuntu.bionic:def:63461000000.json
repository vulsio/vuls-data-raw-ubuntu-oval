		"description": "Daniel Moghimi discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly clear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various instructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to sensitive information. (CVE-2022-40982)  Tavis Ormandy discovered that some AMD processors did not properly handle speculative execution of certain vector register instructions. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20593)  It was discovered that the universal 32bit network packet classifier implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3609)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing network scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3611)  It was discovered that the network packet classifier with netfilter/firewall marks implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3776)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6346-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-tools-5.4.0-1092-raspi - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1 linux-headers-5.4.0-1092-raspi - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1 linux-raspi-5.4-headers-5.4.0-1092 - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1 linux-raspi-5.4-tools-5.4.0-1092 - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1 linux-modules-5.4.0-1092-raspi - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1 linux-buildinfo-5.4.0-1092-raspi - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1 linux-image-5.4.0-1092-raspi - 5.4.0-1092.103~18.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1092.89 linux-tools-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1092.89 linux-headers-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1092.89 linux-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1092.89 linux-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1092.89 linux-headers-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1092.89 linux-image-raspi-hwe-18.04 - 5.4.0.1092.89 linux-tools-raspi-hwe-18.04-edge - 5.4.0.1092.89 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
