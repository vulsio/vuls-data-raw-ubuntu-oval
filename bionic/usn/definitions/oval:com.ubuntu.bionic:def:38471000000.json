		"description": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-10902)  It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-12896)  Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14734)  It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-16276)  It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-18445)  Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-18690)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-18710)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3847-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1026-gcp - 4.15.0-1026.27 No subscription required  linux-image-4.15.0-1028-kvm - 4.15.0-1028.28 No subscription required  linux-image-4.15.0-1030-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1030.32 No subscription required  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-oem - 4.15.0-1030.35 No subscription required  linux-image-4.15.0-1031-aws - 4.15.0-1031.33 No subscription required  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1036-azure - 4.15.0-1036.38 No subscription required  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-43-generic - 4.15.0-43.46 linux-image-4.15.0-43-snapdragon - 4.15.0-43.46 linux-image-4.15.0-43-generic - 4.15.0-43.46 linux-image-4.15.0-43-lowlatency - 4.15.0-43.46 linux-image-4.15.0-43-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-43.46 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-43-lowlatency - 4.15.0-43.46 No subscription required",
