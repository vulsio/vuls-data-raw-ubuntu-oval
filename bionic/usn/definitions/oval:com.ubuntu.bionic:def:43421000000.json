		"description": "Al Viro discovered that the Linux kernel for s390x systems did not properly perform page table upgrades for kernel sections that use secondary address mode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-11884)  It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16234)  Tristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-19768)  It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl() calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-10942)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8648)  Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (soft lockup). (CVE-2020-8992)  Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-9383)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4342-1` to fix the vulnerability.
