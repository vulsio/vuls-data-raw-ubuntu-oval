		"Title": "CVE-2022-1204 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Amateur Radio AX.25 protocol functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1204` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1049-dell300x - 4.15.0-1049.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1123-kvm - 4.15.0-1123.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1066-raspi - 5.4.0-1066.76~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1115-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1115.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-generic - 4.15.0-189.200\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-189-lowlatency - 4.15.0-189.200\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-aws - 4.15.0-1137.148\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-aws - 5.4.0-1081.88~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-azure - 5.4.0-1086.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1049-dell300x - 4.15.0-1049.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-gcp - 4.15.0-1131.147\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-gcp - 5.4.0-1084.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1078-gke - 5.4.0-1078.84~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gkeop - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-generic - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-122-lowlatency - 5.4.0-122.138~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-ibm - 5.4.0-1029.33~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1102-oracle - 4.15.0-1102.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-oracle - 5.4.0-1079.87~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1133-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1133.143\nNo subscription required",
