		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm btree remove: assign new_root only when removal succeedsremove_raw() in dm_btree_remove() may fail due to IO read error(e.g. read the content of origin block fails during shadowing),and the value of shadow_spine::root is uninitialized, butthe uninitialized value is still assign to new_root in theend of dm_btree_remove().For dm-thin, the value of pmd->details_root or pmd->root will becomean uninitialized value, so if trying to read details_info tree againout-of-bound memory may occur as showed below:  general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address0x3fdcb14c8d7520  CPU: 4 PID: 515 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 5.13.0-rc6  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC  RIP: 0010:metadata_ll_load_ie+0x14/0x30  Call Trace:   sm_metadata_count_is_more_than_one+0xb9/0xe0   dm_tm_shadow_block+0x52/0x1c0   shadow_step+0x59/0xf0   remove_raw+0xb2/0x170   dm_btree_remove+0xf4/0x1c0   dm_pool_delete_thin_device+0xc3/0x140   pool_message+0x218/0x2b0   target_message+0x251/0x290   ctl_ioctl+0x1c4/0x4d0   dm_ctl_ioctl+0xe/0x20   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x7b/0xb0   do_syscall_64+0x40/0xb0   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xaeFixing it by only assign new_root when removal succeeds",
