Convert simple snprintf to the more secure scnprintfwith size of PAGE_SIZE. Add condition checking if we are exceedingPAGE_SIZE and exit early from loop. Also add at the end a warning that weexceeded PAGE_SIZE and that stats is disabled. Return -EFBIG in the casewhere we don't have enough space to write the full transition table. Alsodocument in the ABI that this function can return -EFBIG error.",
