		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:fix data races when accessing the reserved amount of block reserves Atspace_info.c we have several places where we access the ->reserved field ofa block reserve without taking the block reserve's spinlock first, whichmakes KCSAN warn about a data race since that field is always updated whileholding the spinlock. The reports from KCSAN are like the following:[117.193526] BUG: KCSAN: data-race in btrfs_block_rsv_release [btrfs] /need_preemptive_reclaim [btrfs] [117.195148] read to 0x000000017f587190 of8 bytes by task 6303 on cpu 3: [117.195172]need_preemptive_reclaim+0x222/0x2f0 [btrfs] [117.195992]__reserve_bytes+0xbb0/0xdc8 [btrfs] [117.196807]btrfs_reserve_metadata_bytes+0x4c/0x120 [btrfs] [117.197620]btrfs_block_rsv_add+0x78/0xa8 [btrfs] [117.198434]btrfs_delayed_update_inode+0x154/0x368 [btrfs] [117.199300]btrfs_update_inode+0x108/0x1c8 [btrfs] [117.200122]btrfs_dirty_inode+0xb4/0x140 [btrfs] [117.200937]btrfs_update_time+0x8c/0xb0 [btrfs] [117.201754] touch_atime+0x16c/0x1e0[117.201789] filemap_read+0x674/0x728 [117.201823]btrfs_file_read_iter+0xf8/0x410 [btrfs] [117.202653] vfs_read+0x2b6/0x498[117.203454] ksys_read+0xa2/0x150 [117.203473] __s390x_sys_read+0x68/0x88[117.203495] do_syscall+0x1c6/0x210 [117.203517] __do_syscall+0xc8/0xf0[117.203539] system_call+0x70/0x98 [117.203579] write to 0x000000017f587190of 8 bytes by task 11 on cpu 0: [117.203604]btrfs_block_rsv_release+0x2e8/0x578 [btrfs] [117.204432]btrfs_delayed_inode_release_metadata+0x7c/0x1d0 [btrfs] [117.205259]__btrfs_update_delayed_inode+0x37c/0x5e0 [btrfs] [117.206093]btrfs_async_run_delayed_root+0x356/0x498 [btrfs] [117.206917]btrfs_work_helper+0x160/0x7a0 [btrfs] [117.207738]process_one_work+0x3b6/0x838 [117.207768] worker_thread+0x75e/0xb10[117.207797] kthread+0x21a/0x230 [117.207830] __ret_from_fork+0x6c/0xb8[117.207861] ret_from_fork+0xa/0x30 So add a helper to get the reservedamount of a block reserve while holding the lock. The value may be not beup to date anymore when used by need_preemptive_reclaim() andbtrfs_preempt_reclaim_metadata_space(), but that's ok since the worst itcan do is cause more reclaim work do be done sooner rather than later.Reading the field while holding the lock instead of using the data_race()annotation is used in order to prevent load tearing.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26905` to fix the vulnerability.
