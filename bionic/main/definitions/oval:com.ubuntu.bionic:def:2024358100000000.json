The buffer objects in vmw_plane_state instead of using the builtinmap_and_cache were trying to handle the lifetime of the mapped memorythemselves, leading to crashes. Use the map_and_cache instead of trying tomanage the lifetime of the buffer objects held by the vmw_plane_state.Fixes kernel oops'es in IGT's kms_cursor_legacy forked-bo.",
