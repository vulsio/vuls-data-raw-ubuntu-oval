		"title": "CVE-2022-23639 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scopedthreads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust.crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that thealignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, thealignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than`Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race.Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected bythis issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets arenot affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7.There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23639` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibstd-rust-1.59 - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-all - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-clippy - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-gdb - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-lldb - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrust-src - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrustc - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nrustfmt - 1.59.0+dfsg1~ubuntu1~llvm-1~ubuntu1~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
