		"description": "Tokio is a runtime for writing applications with Rust. Starting withversion 1.7.0 and prior to versions 1.18.4, 1.20.3, and 1.23.1, whenconfiguring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will reset`reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previouslyconfigured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes theconfiguration. Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the namedpipe's associated path is accessible via a publicly shared folder (SMB).Versions 1.23.1, 1.20.3, and 1.18.4 have been patched. The fix will also bepresent in all releases starting from version 1.24.0. Named pipes wereintroduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are notaffected. As a workaround, ensure that `pipe_mode` is set first afterinitializing a `ServerOptions`.",
