		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: skip netdev events generated on netns removal syzbotreported following (harmless) WARN: WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2648 atnet/netfilter/core.c:468 nft_netdev_unregister_hooksnet/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:230 [inline] nf_tables_unregister_hookinclude/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1090 [inline]__nft_release_basechain+0x138/0x640 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9524nft_netdev_event net/netfilter/nft_chain_filter.c:351 [inline]nf_tables_netdev_event+0x521/0x8a0 net/netfilter/nft_chain_filter.c:382reproducer: unshare -n bash -c 'ip link add br0 type bridge; nft add tablenetdev t ; \\ nft add chain netdev t ingress \\{ type filter hook ingressdevice \"br0\" \\ priority 0\\; policy drop\\; \\}' Problem is that when netnsdevice exit hooks create the UNREGISTER event, the .pre_exit hook fornf_tables core has already removed the base hook. Notifier attempts to dothis again. The need to do base hook unregister unconditionally was neededin the past, because notifier was last stage where reg->dev dereference wassafe. Now that nf_tables does the hook removal in .pre_exit, this isn'tneeded anymore.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47452` to fix the vulnerability.
