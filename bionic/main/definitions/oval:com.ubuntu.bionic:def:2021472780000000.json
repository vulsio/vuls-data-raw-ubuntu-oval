		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bus: mhi: pci_generic: Fix possible use-after-free in mhi_pci_remove()This driver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that functiondoes not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that thetimer handler may still be running after the driver's remove functionhas finished, which would result in a use-after-free.Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handlerhas finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.",
