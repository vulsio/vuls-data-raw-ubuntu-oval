		"title": "CVE-2024-26654 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs Thedreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the spu_dma_workcould also arm the dreamcastcard->timer. When the snd_pcm_substream isclosing, the aica_channel will be deallocated. But it could still bedereferenced in the worker thread. The reason is that del_timer() willreturn directly regardless of whether the timer handler is running or notand the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result, theUAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below: (Thread 1) |(Thread 2) snd_aicapcm_pcm_close() | ... | run_spu_dma() //worker |mod_timer() flush_work() | del_timer() | aica_period_elapsed() //timerkfree(dreamcastcard->channel) | schedule_work() | run_spu_dma() //worker... | dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE In order to mitigate this bug andother possible corner cases, call mod_timer() conditionally inrun_spu_dma(), then implement PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer andworker. The sync_stop op will be called from PCM core appropriately whenneeded.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26654` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-oracle - 5.4.0-1127.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
