		"Description": "A message-forgery issue was discovered incrypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go in supplementary Go cryptographylibraries 2019-03-25. According to the OpenPGP Message Format specificationin RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can contain one or moreoptional \"Hash\" Armor Headers. The \"Hash\" Armor Header specifies themessage digest algorithm(s) used for the signature. However, the Goclearsign package ignores the value of this header, which allows anattacker to spoof it. Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim tobelieve the signature was generated using a different message digestalgorithm than what was actually used. Moreover, since the library skipsArmor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitraryArmor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messageswithout invalidating the signatures.",
