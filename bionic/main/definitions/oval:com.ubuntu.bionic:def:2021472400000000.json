		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:qrtr: fix OOB Read in qrtr_endpoint_post Syzbot reported slab-out-of-boundsRead in qrtr_endpoint_post. The problem was in wrong _size_ type: if (len!= ALIGN(size, 4) + hdrlen) goto err; If size from qrtr_hdr is 4294967293(0xfffffffd), the result of ALIGN(size, 4) will be 0. In case of len ==hdrlen and size == 4294967293 in header this check won't fail andskb_put_data(skb, data + hdrlen, size); will read out of bound from data,which is hdrlen allocated block.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47240` to fix the vulnerability.
