		"Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.Versions prior to 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 have a potential issue in`msg_translator.c:2628` which might lead to a server crash. This issue wasfound while fuzzing the function `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` but could notbe reproduced against a running instance of OpenSIPS. This issue could notbe exploited against a running instance of OpenSIPS since no publicfunction was found to make use of this vulnerable code. Even in the case ofexploitation through unknown vectors, it is highly unlikely that this issuewould lead to anything other than Denial of Service. This issue has beenfixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.",
