Itreplaces mod_timer() by sk_reset_timer(), and del_timer() bysk_stop_timer(). Function sk_reset_timer() will increase the refcount ofsock if it is called on an inactive timer, hence, in case the timerexpires, we need to decrease the refcount ourselves in the handler,otherwise, the sock refcount will be unbalanced and the sock will never befreed.",
