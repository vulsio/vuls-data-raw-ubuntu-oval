		"title": "CVE-2022-31152 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by theMatrix.org Foundation. The Matrix specification specifies a list of [eventauthorizationrules](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/rooms/v9/#authorization-rules) whichmust be checked when determining if an event should be accepted into aroom. In versions of Synapse up to and including version 1.61.0, some ofthese rules are not correctly applied. An attacker could craft events whichwould be accepted by Synapse but not a spec-conformant server, potentiallycausing divergence in the room state between servers. Administrators ofhomeservers with federation enabled are advised to upgrade to version1.62.0 or higher. Federation can be disabled by setting[`federation_domain_whitelist`](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist)to an empty list (`[]`) as a workaround.",
