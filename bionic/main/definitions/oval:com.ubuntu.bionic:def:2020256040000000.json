		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a race conditionwhen migrating timers between x86 HVM vCPUs. When migrating timers of x86HVM guests between its vCPUs, the locking model used allows for a secondvCPU of the same guest (also operating on the timers) to release a lockthat it didn't acquire. The most likely effect of the issue is a hang orcrash of the hypervisor, i.e., a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions ofXen are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are notvulnerable. Only x86 HVM guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV andPVH cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only guests with more than one vCPUcan exploit the vulnerability.",
