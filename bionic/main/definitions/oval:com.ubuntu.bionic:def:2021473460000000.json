		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:coresight: tmc-etf: Fix global-out-of-bounds in tmc_update_etf_buffer()commit 6f755e85c332 (\"coresight: Add helper for inserting synchronizationpackets\") removed trailing '\\0' from barrier_pkt array and updated the callsites like etb_update_buffer() to have proper checks for barrier_pkt sizebefore read but missed updating tmc_update_etf_buffer() which still readsbarrier_pkt past the array size resulting in KASAN out-of-bounds bug. Fixthis by adding a check for barrier_pkt size before accessing like it isdone in etb_update_buffer().
