		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm:Check output polling initialized before disabling Indrm_kms_helper_poll_disable() check if output polling support isinitialized before disabling polling. If not flag this as a warning.Additionally in drm_mode_config_helper_suspend() anddrm_mode_config_helper_resume() calls, that re the callers of thesefunctions, avoid invoking them if polling is not initialized. For driverslike hyperv-drm, that do not initialize connector polling, if suspend iscalled without this check, it leads to suspend failure with following stack[ 770.719392] Freezing remaining freezable tasks ...
