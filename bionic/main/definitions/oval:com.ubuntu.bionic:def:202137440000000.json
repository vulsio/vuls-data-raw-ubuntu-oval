    "Title": "CVE-2021-3744 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3744` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-aws - 4.15.0-1116.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-aws - 5.4.0-1060.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-azure - 5.4.0-1064.67~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-dell300x - 4.15.0-1031.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-gcp - 4.15.0-1112.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-gcp - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gke - 5.4.0-1056.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gkeop - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-kvm - 4.15.0-1103.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-oracle - 4.15.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-oracle - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1047-raspi - 5.4.0-1047.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1099-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1099.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-generic - 4.15.0-163.171\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-163-lowlatency - 4.15.0-163.171\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-aws - 4.15.0-1116.123\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1060-aws - 5.4.0-1060.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1064-azure - 5.4.0-1064.67~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-dell300x - 4.15.0-1031.36\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-gcp - 4.15.0-1112.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-gcp - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1056-gke - 5.4.0-1056.59~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gkeop - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-generic - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-91-lowlatency - 5.4.0-91.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-oracle - 4.15.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1058-oracle - 5.4.0-1058.62~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1116-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1116.125\nNo subscription required",
