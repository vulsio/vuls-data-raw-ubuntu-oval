		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix potential index out of bounds in color transformationfunction Fixes index out of bounds issue in the color transformationfunction. The issue could occur when the index 'i' exceeds the number oftransfer function points (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS). The fix adds a check toensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing the transfer function points.If 'i' is out of bounds, an error message is logged and the functionreturns false to indicate an error.
