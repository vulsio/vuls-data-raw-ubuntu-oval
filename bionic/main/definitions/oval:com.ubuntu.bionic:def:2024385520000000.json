		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix potential index out of bounds in color transformationfunctionFixes index out of bounds issue in the color transformation function.The issue could occur when the index 'i' exceeds the number of transferfunction points (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS).The fix adds a check to ensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing thetransfer function points. If 'i' is out of bounds, an error message islogged and the function returns false to indicate an error.Reported by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn10/dcn10_cm_common.c:405cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.red' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn10/dcn10_cm_common.c:406cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.green' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn10/dcn10_cm_common.c:407cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.blue' 1025 <= s32max",
