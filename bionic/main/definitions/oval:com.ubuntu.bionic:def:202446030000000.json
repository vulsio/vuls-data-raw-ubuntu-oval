		"description": "Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be veryslow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functionsEVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public keyor DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parametersthat are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this maylead to a Denial of Service. The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() orEVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some ofthose computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is toolarge. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will notallow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in lengthfor signature verification. However the key and parameter check functionsdo not limit the modulus size when performing the checks. An applicationthat calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies akey or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable toa Denial of Service attack. These functions are not called by OpenSSLitself on untrusted DSA keys so only applications that directly call thesefunctions may be vulnerable. Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey andpkeyparam command line applications when using the `-check` option. TheOpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.",
