		"Title": "CVE-2023-32731 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it skippedparsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK table mutationsto also be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization of HPACK tablesbetween sender and receiver. If leveraged, say, between a proxy and abackend, this could lead to requests from the proxy being interpreted ascontaining headers from different proxy clients - leading to an informationleak that can be used for privilege escalation or data exfiltration.
