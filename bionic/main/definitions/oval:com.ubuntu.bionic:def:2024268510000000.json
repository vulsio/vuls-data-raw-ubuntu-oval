		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_conntrack_h323: Add protection for bmp length out of rangeUBSAN load reports an exception of BRK#5515 SHIFT_ISSUE:Bitwise shifts thatare out of bounds for their data type. vmlinux get_bitmap(b=75) + 712<net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.c:0> vmlinuxdecode_seq(bs=0xFFFFFFD008037000, f=0xFFFFFFD008037018, level=134443100) +1956 <net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.c:592> vmlinuxdecode_choice(base=0xFFFFFFD0080370F0, level=23843636) + 1216<net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.c:814> vmlinuxdecode_seq(f=0xFFFFFFD0080371A8, level=134443500) + 812<net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.c:576> vmlinuxdecode_choice(base=0xFFFFFFD008037280, level=0) + 1216<net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.c:814> vmlinux DecodeRasMessage() +304 <net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.c:833> vmlinux ras_help() + 684<net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_main.c:1728> vmlinux nf_confirm() + 188<net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto.c:137> Due to abnormal data in skb->data,the extension bitmap length exceeds 32 when decoding ras message then usesthe length to make a shift operation. It will change into negative afterseveral loop. UBSAN load could detect a negative shift as an undefinedbehaviour and reports exception. So we add the protection to avoid thelength exceeding 32. Or else it will return out of range error and stopdecoding.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26851` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1133-azure - 5.4.0-1133.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-gcp - 5.4.0-1132.141~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-ibm - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-oracle - 5.4.0-1127.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
