		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default deviceattribute group The DisplayPort driver's sysfs nodes may be present to theuserspace before typec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe.This means that a sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error bydeferencing dp->hpd in hpd_show or dp->lock in pin_assignment_show, asdev_get_drvdata() returns NULL in those cases. Remove manual sysfs nodecreation in favor of adding attribute group as default for devices bound tothe driver. The ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro is not used here otherwise thepath to the sysfs nodes is no longer compliant with the ABI.",
