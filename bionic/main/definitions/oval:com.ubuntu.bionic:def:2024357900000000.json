		"title": "CVE-2024-35790 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default deviceattribute group The DisplayPort driver's sysfs nodes may be present to theuserspace before typec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe.This means that a sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error bydeferencing dp->hpd in hpd_show or dp->lock in pin_assignment_show, asdev_get_drvdata() returns NULL in those cases. Remove manual sysfs nodecreation in favor of adding attribute group as default for devices bound tothe driver. The ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro is not used here otherwise thepath to the sysfs nodes is no longer compliant with the ABI.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35790` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
