		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run andteardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() wasrunning in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other badpossibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called byfree_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from atest case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this ispossible (see link below).Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stallswapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm thatthe swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between gettingthe reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly infree_swap_and_cache().Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrandfor deriving this):--8<-----__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in\"count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE\".swapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turnsi->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages arestill references by swap entries.Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHEProcess 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls__try_to_reclaim_swap().__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->swap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()->...WRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages, si->inuse_pages - nr_entries);What stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cachebut before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?--8<-----",
