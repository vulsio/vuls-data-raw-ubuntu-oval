		"Title": "CVE-2022-3640 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Linux Kernel. Affected is the function l2cap_conn_del of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211944. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth stack in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3640` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1136-kvm - 4.15.0-1136.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1080-raspi - 5.4.0-1080.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1128-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1128.136\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-aws - 5.4.0-1096.104~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-azure - 5.4.0-1103.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-gcp - 5.4.0-1100.109~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-generic - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-139-lowlatency - 5.4.0-139.156~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-ibm - 5.4.0-1044.49~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-oracle - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1146-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1146.156\nNo subscription required",
