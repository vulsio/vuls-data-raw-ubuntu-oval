		"description": "** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free(read) in the debugfs_remove function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is usedto remove a file or directory in debugfs that was previously created with acall to another debugfs function such as debugfs_create_file). NOTE: Linuxkernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs,instead this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19770` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1077-gke - 4.15.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1077-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1094-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1094.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1027-gke - 5.4.0-1027.28~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1003-gkeop - 5.4.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1010-dell300x - 4.15.0-1010.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
