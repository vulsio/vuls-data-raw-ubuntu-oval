		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: uvc: use correct buffer size when parsing configfs listsThis commit fixes uvc gadget support on 32-bit platforms.Commit 0df28607c5cb (\"usb: gadget: uvc: Generalise helper functions forreuse\") introduced a helper function __uvcg_iter_item_entries() to aidwith parsing lists of items on configfs attributes stores. This functionis a generalization of another very similar function, which used astack-allocated temporary buffer of fixed size for each item in the listand used the sizeof() operator to check for potential buffer overruns.The new function was changed to allocate the now variably sized tempbuffer on heap, but wasn't properly updated to also check for max buffersize using the computed size instead of sizeof() operator.As a result, the maximum item size was 7 (plus null terminator) on64-bit platforms, and 3 on 32-bit ones. While 7 is accidentally justbarely enough, 3 is definitely too small for some of UVC configfsattributes. For example, dwFrameInteval, specified in 100ns units,usually has 6-digit item values, e.g. 166666 for 60fps.",
