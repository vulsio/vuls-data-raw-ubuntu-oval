		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit archesThe hashtab code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number ofhash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if theresulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itselfcan overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncateneatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, whichcontains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. So apply the samefix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check to before the roundup.",
