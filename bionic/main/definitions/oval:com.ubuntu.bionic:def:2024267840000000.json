		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pmdomain: arm: Fix NULL dereference on scmi_perf_domain removalOn unloading of the scmi_perf_domain module got the below splat, when inthe DT provided to the system under test the '#power-domain-cells' propertywas missing. Indeed, this particular setup causes the probe to bail outearly without giving any error, which leads to the ->remove() callback getsto run too, but without all the expected initialized structures in place.Add a check and bail out early on remove too.
