		"title": "CVE-2023-0465 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low",
		"description": "Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates maybe vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certainchecks. Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silentlyignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for thatcertificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalidcertificate policies in order to circumvent policy checking on thecertificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can beenabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities orby calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0465` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.1 - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.22\nopenssl - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.12\nopenssl1.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.12\nNo subscription required",
