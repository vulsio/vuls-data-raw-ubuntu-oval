		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/kvm: Teardown PV features on boot CPU as well Various PV features(Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through memory shared with hypervisorand when we restore from hibernation we must properly teardown all thesefeatures to make sure hypervisor doesn't write to stale locations after wejump to the previously hibernated kernel (which can try to place anythingthere). For secondary CPUs the job is already done bykvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to do the same for boot CPU.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47112` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
