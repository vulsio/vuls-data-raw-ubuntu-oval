		"title": "CVE-2021-41125 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. Ifyou use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spiderattributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose yourcredentials to the request target. This includes requests generated byScrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the`ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached throughredirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain`spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive theconfigured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 ora lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you mayupgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTPauthentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the`w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into avalue that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request,instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.",
