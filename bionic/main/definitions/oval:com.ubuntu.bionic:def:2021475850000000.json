		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix memory leak in __add_inode_ref()Line 1169 (#3) allocates a memory chunk for victim_name by kmalloc(),but  when the function returns in line 1184 (#4) victim_name allocatedby line 1169 (#3) is not freed, which will lead to a memory leak.There is a similar snippet of code in this function as allocating a memorychunk for victim_name in line 1104 (#1) as well as releasing the memoryin line 1116 (#2).We should kfree() victim_name when the return value of backref_in_log()is less than zero and before the function returns in line 1184 (#4).1057 static inline int __add_inode_ref(struct btrfs_trans_handle *trans,1058 \t\t\t\t  struct btrfs_root *root,1059 \t\t\t\t  struct btrfs_path *path,1060 \t\t\t\t  struct btrfs_root *log_root,1061 \t\t\t\t  struct btrfs_inode *dir,1062 \t\t\t\t  struct btrfs_inode *inode,1063 \t\t\t\t  u64 inode_objectid, u64 parent_objectid,1064 \t\t\t\t  u64 ref_index, char *name, int namelen,1065 \t\t\t\t  int *search_done)1066 {1104 \tvictim_name = kmalloc(victim_name_len, GFP_NOFS);\t// #1: kmalloc (victim_name-1)1105 \tif (!victim_name)1106 \t\treturn -ENOMEM;1112\tret = backref_in_log(log_root, &search_key,1113\t\t\tparent_objectid, victim_name,1114\t\t\tvictim_name_len);1115\tif (ret < 0) {1116\t\tkfree(victim_name); // #2: kfree (victim_name-1)1117\t\treturn ret;1118\t} else if (!ret) {1169 \tvictim_name = kmalloc(victim_name_len, GFP_NOFS);\t// #3: kmalloc (victim_name-2)1170 \tif (!victim_name)1171 \t\treturn -ENOMEM;1180 \tret = backref_in_log(log_root, &search_key,1181 \t\t\tparent_objectid, victim_name,1182 \t\t\tvictim_name_len);1183 \tif (ret < 0) {1184 \t\treturn ret; // #4: missing kfree (victim_name-2)1185 \t} else if (!ret) {1241 \treturn 0;1242 }\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47585` to fix the vulnerability.
