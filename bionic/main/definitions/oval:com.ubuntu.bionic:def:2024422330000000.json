		"title": "CVE-2024-42233 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:filemap: replace pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock()The vmf->ptl in filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none() is still set fromhandle_pte_fault().  But at the same time, we did a pte_unmap(vmf->pte).After a pte_unmap(vmf->pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page tablemay be racily changed and vmf->ptl maybe fails to protect the actual pagetable.  Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() withpte_offset_map_nolock().As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to useit infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF.  Also, ifthe PTL fails, the issue fixed by commit 58f327f2ce80 (\"filemap: avoidunnecessary major faults in filemap_fault()\") might reappear.",
