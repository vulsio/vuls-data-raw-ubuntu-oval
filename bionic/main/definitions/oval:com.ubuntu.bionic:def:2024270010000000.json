		"title": "CVE-2024-27001 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: comedi:vmk80xx: fix incomplete endpoint checking While vmk80xx does have endpointchecking implemented, some things can fall through the cracks. Depending onthe hardware model, URBs can have either bulk or interrupt type, andcurrent version of vmk80xx_find_usb_endpoints() function does not take thatfully into account. While this warning does not seem to be too harmful, atthe very least it will crash systems with 'panic_on_warn' set on them. Fixthe issue found by Syzkaller [1] by somewhat simplifying the endpointchecking process with usb_find_common_endpoints() and ensuring that onlyexpected endpoint types are present. This patch has not been tested on realhardware.
