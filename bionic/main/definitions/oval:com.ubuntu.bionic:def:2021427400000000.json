If the output of this package ispassed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), anattacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows driveletter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z].Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Zand lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.",
