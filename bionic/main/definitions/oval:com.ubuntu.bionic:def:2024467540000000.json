		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops.The syzbot reported that the lwt_seg6 related BPF ops can be invokedvia bpf_test_run() without without entering input_action_end_bpf()first.Martin KaFai Lau said that self test for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCALprobably didn't work since it was introduced in commit 04d4b274e2a(\"ipv6: sr: Add seg6local action End.BPF\"). The reason is that theper-CPU variable seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh is never assigned in the selftest case but each BPF function expects it.Remove test_run for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL.",
