		"description": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Prior to versions6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Luascript can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash ofthe redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patchingthe redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is toblock access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.",
