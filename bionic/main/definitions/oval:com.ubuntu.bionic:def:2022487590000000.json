		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rpmsg: char: Fix race between the release of rpmsg_ctrldev and cdevstruct rpmsg_ctrldev contains a struct cdev. The current code freesthe rpmsg_ctrldev struct in rpmsg_ctrldev_release_device(), but thecdev is a managed object, therefore its release is not predictableand the rpmsg_ctrldev could be freed before the cdev is entirelyreleased, as in the backtrace below.[   93.625603] ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object type: timer_listhint: delayed_work_timer_fn+0x0/0x7c[   93.636115] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 12 at lib/debugobjects.c:488debug_print_object+0x13c/0x1b0[   93.644799] Modules linked in: veth xt_cgroup xt_MASQUERADE rfcommalgif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg uinput ip6table_nat fuse uvcvideovideobuf2_vmalloc venus_enc venus_dec videobuf2_dma_contig hci_uartbtandroid btqca snd_soc_rt5682_i2c bluetooth qcom_spmi_temp_alarmsnd_soc_rt5682v[   93.715175] CPU: 0 PID: 12 Comm: kworker/0:1 Tainted: G    B5.4.163-lockdep #26[   93.723855] Hardware name: Google Lazor (rev3 - 8) with LTE (DT)[   93.730055] Workqueue: events kobject_delayed_cleanup[   93.735271] pstate: 60c00009 (nZCv daif +PAN +UAO)[   93.740216] pc : debug_print_object+0x13c/0x1b0[   93.744890] lr : debug_print_object+0x13c/0x1b0[   93.749555] sp : ffffffacf5bc7940[   93.752978] x29: ffffffacf5bc7940 x28: dfffffd000000000[   93.758448] x27: ffffffacdb11a800 x26: dfffffd000000000[   93.763916] x25: ffffffd0734f856c x24: dfffffd000000000[   93.769389] x23: 0000000000000000 x22: ffffffd0733c35b0[   93.774860] x21: ffffffd0751994a0 x20: ffffffd075ec27c0[   93.780338] x19: ffffffd075199100 x18: 00000000000276e0[   93.785814] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: dfffffd000000000[   93.791291] x15: ffffffffffffffff x14: 6e6968207473696c[   93.796768] x13: 0000000000000000 x12: ffffffd075e2b000[   93.802244] x11: 0000000000000001 x10: 0000000000000000[   93.807723] x9 : d13400dff1921900 x8 : d13400dff1921900[   93.813200] x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000[   93.818676] x5 : 0000000000000080 x4 : 0000000000000000[   93.824152] x3 : ffffffd0732a0fa4 x2 : 0000000000000001[   93.829628] x1 : ffffffacf5bc7580 x0 : 0000000000000061[   93.835104] Call trace:[   93.837644]  debug_print_object+0x13c/0x1b0[   93.841963]  __debug_check_no_obj_freed+0x25c/0x3c0[   93.846987]  debug_check_no_obj_freed+0x18/0x20[   93.851669]  slab_free_freelist_hook+0xbc/0x1e4[   93.856346]  kfree+0xfc/0x2f4[   93.859416]  rpmsg_ctrldev_release_device+0x78/0xb8[   93.864445]  device_release+0x84/0x168[   93.868310]  kobject_cleanup+0x12c/0x298[   93.872356]  kobject_delayed_cleanup+0x10/0x18[   93.876948]  process_one_work+0x578/0x92c[   93.881086]  worker_thread+0x804/0xcf8[   93.884963]  kthread+0x2a8/0x314[   93.888303]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18The cdev_device_add/del() API was created to address this issue (seecommit '233ed09d7fda (\"chardev: add helper function to register chardevs with a struct device\")'), use it instead of cdev add/del().",
