		"Title": "CVE-2020-16166 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "The Linux kernel through 5.7.11 allows remote attackers to make observations that help to obtain sensitive information about the internal state of the network RNG, aka CID-f227e3ec3b5c. This is related to drivers/char/random.c and kernel/time/timer.c. It was discovered that the state of network RNG in the Linux kernel was potentially observable. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-16166` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-lowlatency - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-118-generic - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-118-lowlatency - 4.15.0-118.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1083-aws - 4.15.0-1083.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1025-aws - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-azure - 4.15.0-1096.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-azure - 5.4.0-1026.26~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-gcp - 4.15.0-1084.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gcp - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-gke - 4.15.0-1070.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1075-kvm - 4.15.0-1075.76\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1097-oem - 4.15.0-1097.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1054-oracle - 4.15.0-1054.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-oracle - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1019-raspi - 5.4.0-1019.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1071-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1071.75\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-4.15.0-118-lowlatency - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-118-generic - 4.15.0-118.119\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-118-lowlatency - 4.15.0-118.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1083-aws - 4.15.0-1083.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1025-aws - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-azure - 4.15.0-1096.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1026-azure - 5.4.0-1026.26~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1084-gcp - 4.15.0-1084.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gcp - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1070-gke - 4.15.0-1070.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-generic - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-48-lowlatency - 5.4.0-48.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1097-oem - 4.15.0-1097.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1054-oracle - 4.15.0-1054.58\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-oracle - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1087-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1087.95\nNo subscription required",
