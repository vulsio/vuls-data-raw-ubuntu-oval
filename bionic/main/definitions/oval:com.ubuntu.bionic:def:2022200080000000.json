		"Title": "CVE-2022-20008 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In mmc_blk_read_single of block.c, there is a possible way to read kernel heap memory due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure if reading from an SD card that triggers errors, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-216481035References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the MMC/SD subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle read errors from SD cards in certain situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-20008` to fix the vulnerability.
