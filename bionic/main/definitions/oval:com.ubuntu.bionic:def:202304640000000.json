		"Title": "CVE-2023-0464 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0464` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.1 - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.22\nopenssl - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.12\nopenssl1.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.12\nNo subscription required",
