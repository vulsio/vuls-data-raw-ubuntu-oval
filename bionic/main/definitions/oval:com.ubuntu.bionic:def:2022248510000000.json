The pdf editor tool has an editpdf profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properlysanitized and an user can enter relative paths like../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.pngvia tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the editedprofile the pdf icon has the image on that path(if image is present). Bothissues require an attacker to be able to login to LAM admin interface.
