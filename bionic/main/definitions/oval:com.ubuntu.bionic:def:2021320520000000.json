		"Title": "CVE-2021-32052 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32052` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.17\npython-django-common - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.17\npython3-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.17\nNo subscription required",
