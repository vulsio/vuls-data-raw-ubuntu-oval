		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool In practice thedriver should never send more commands than are allocated to a queue'sevent pool. In the unlikely event that this happens, the code asserts aBUG_ON, and in the case that the kernel is not configured to crash on panicreturns a junk event pointer from the empty event list causing things tospiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact of the ibmvfcdriver first being upstreamed, and it is well known now that the use ofBUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable scenario. There isnothing about this scenario that prevents the driver from recovering andcarrying on. Remove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() andreturn a NULL pointer in the case of an empty event pool. Update all callsites to ibmvfc_get_event() to check for a NULL pointer and perfrom theappropriate failure or recovery action.",
