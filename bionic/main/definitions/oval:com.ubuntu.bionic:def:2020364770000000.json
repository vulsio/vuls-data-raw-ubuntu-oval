		"description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.24.0. The verification ofX.509 certificates when matching the expected common name (the cn argumentof mbedtls_x509_crt_verify) with the actual certificate name is mishandled:when the subjecAltName extension is present, the expected name is comparedto any name in that extension regardless of its type. This means that anattacker could impersonate a 4-byte or 16-byte domain by getting acertificate for the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 address (this would requirethe attacker to control that IP address, though).",
