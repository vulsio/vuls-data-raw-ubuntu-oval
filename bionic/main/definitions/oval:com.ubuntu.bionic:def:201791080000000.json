		"description": "An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adnshost mishandles a missingfinal newline on a stdin read. It is wrong to increment used as well assetting r, since used is incremented according to r, later. Rather oneshould be doing what read() would have done. Without this fix, adnshost mayread and process one byte beyond the buffer, perhaps crashing or perhapssomehow leaking the value of that byte.",
