		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/ptrace: handle setting of fpc register correctly If the content of thefloating point control (fpc) register of a traced process is modified withthe ptrace interface the new value is tested for validity by temporarilyloading it into the fpc register. This may lead to corruption of the fpcregister of the tracing process: if an interrupt happens while the value istemporarily loaded into the fpc register, and within interrupt contextfloating point or vector registers are used, the current fp/vx registersare saved with save_fpu_regs() assuming they belong to user space and willbe loaded into fp/vx registers when returning to user space. test_fp_ctl()restores the original user space fpc register value, however it will bediscarded, when returning to user space. In result the tracer willincorrectly continue to run with the value that was supposed to be used forthe traced process. Fix this by saving fpu register contents withsave_fpu_regs() before using test_fp_ctl().",
