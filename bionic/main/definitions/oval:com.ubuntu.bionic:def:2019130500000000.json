    "Title": "CVE-2019-13050 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-13050` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndirmngr - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngnupg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngnupg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngnupg-l10n - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngnupg-utils - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngnupg2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpg - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpg-agent - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpg-wks-client - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpg-wks-server - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpgconf - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpgsm - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpgv - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpgv-static - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpgv-win32 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\ngpgv2 - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\nscdaemon - 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.5\nNo subscription required",
