		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: validate lwtstate->data before returning from skb_tunnel_info()skb_tunnel_info() returns pointer of lwtstate->data as ip_tunnel_infotype without validation. lwtstate->data can have various types such asmpls_iptunnel_encap, etc and these are not compatible.So skb_tunnel_info() should validate before returning that pointer.Splat looks like:BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan]Read of size 2 at addr ffff888106ec2698 by task ping/811CPU: 1 PID: 811 Comm: ping Not tainted 5.13.0+ #1195Call Trace: dump_stack_lvl+0x56/0x7b print_address_description.constprop.8.cold.13+0x13/0x2ee ? vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan] ? vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan] kasan_report.cold.14+0x83/0xdf ? vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan] vxlan_get_route+0x418/0x4b0 [vxlan] [ ... ] vxlan_xmit_one+0x148b/0x32b0 [vxlan] [ ... ] vxlan_xmit+0x25c5/0x4780 [vxlan] [ ... ] dev_hard_start_xmit+0x1ae/0x6e0 __dev_queue_xmit+0x1f39/0x31a0 [ ... ] neigh_xmit+0x2f9/0x940 mpls_xmit+0x911/0x1600 [mpls_iptunnel] lwtunnel_xmit+0x18f/0x450 ip_finish_output2+0x867/0x2040 [ ... ]",
