This normally doesn't happensince it's only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offloadwhich has its own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, dothat by returning an error code and converting that to success onthe cfg80211 boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers ofieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().",
