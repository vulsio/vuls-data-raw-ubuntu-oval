		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fwcomponent can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Whenfw_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct isalways copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problemwhen updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is alwayscalled on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt ofthe still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to ause-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit76e42ae831991c828cffa8c37736ebfb831ad5ec.",
