		"title": "CVE-2023-3341 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "The code that processes control channel messages sent to `named` callscertain functions recursively during packet parsing. Recursion depth isonly limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on theenvironment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of availablestack memory, causing `named` to terminate unexpectedly. Since eachincoming control channel message is fully parsed before its contents areauthenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the attacker to hold avalid RNDC key; only network access to the control channel's configured TCPport is necessary. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.2.0 through9.16.43, 9.18.0 through 9.18.18, 9.19.0 through 9.19.16, 9.9.3-S1 through9.16.43-S1, and 9.18.0-S1 through 9.18.18-S1.",
