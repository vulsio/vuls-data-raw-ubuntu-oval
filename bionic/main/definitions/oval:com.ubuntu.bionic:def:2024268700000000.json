		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFSv4.2: fix nfs4_listxattr kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102 A call tolistxattr() with a buffer size = 0 returns the actual size of the bufferneeded for a subsequent call. When size > 0, nfs4_listxattr() does notreturn an error because either generic_listxattr() ornfs4_listxattr_nfs4_label() consumes exactly all the bytes then size is 0when calling nfs4_listxattr_nfs4_user() which then triggers the followingkernel BUG: [ 99.403778] kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102!
