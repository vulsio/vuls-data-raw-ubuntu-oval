		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: arm64:dts: qcom: msm8998: Fix CPU/L2 idle state latency and residency Theentry/exit latency and minimum residency in state for the idle states ofMSM8998 were ..bad: first of all, for all of them the timings were writtenfor CPU sleep but the min-residency-us param was miscalculated (supposedly,while porting this from downstream); Then, the power collapse states aresetting PC on both the CPU cluster *and* the L2 cache, which have differenttimings: in the specific case of L2 the times are higher so these onesshould be taken into account instead of the CPU ones. This parametermisconfiguration was not giving particular issues because on MSM8998 therewas no CPU scaling at all, so cluster/L2 power collapse was rarely (ifever) hit. When CPU scaling is enabled, though, the wrong timings willproduce SoC unstability shown to the user as random, apparently error-less,sudden reboots and/or lockups. This set of parameters are stabilizing theSoC when CPU scaling is ON and when power collapse is frequently hit.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47187` to fix the vulnerability.
