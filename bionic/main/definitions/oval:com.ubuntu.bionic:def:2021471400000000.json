		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/amd: Clear DMA ops when switching domainSince commit 08a27c1c3ecf (\"iommu: Add support to change default domainof an iommu group\") a user can switch a device between IOMMU and directDMA through sysfs. This doesn't work for AMD IOMMU at the moment becausedev->dma_ops is not cleared when switching from a DMA to an identityIOMMU domain. The DMA layer thus attempts to use the dma-iommu ops on anidentity domain, causing an oops:  # echo 0000:00:05.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/unbind  # echo identity > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:05.0/iommu_group/type  # echo 0000:00:05.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/bind   ...  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028   ...   Call Trace:    iommu_dma_alloc    e1000e_setup_tx_resources    e1000e_openSince iommu_change_dev_def_domain() calls probe_finalize() again, clearthe dma_ops there like Vt-d does.",
