		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gfs2: ignore negated quota changesWhen lots of quota changes are made, there may be cases in which aninode's quota information is increased and then decreased, such as whenblocks are added to a file, then deleted from it. If the timing isright, function do_qc can add pending quota changes to a transaction,then later, another call to do_qc can negate those changes, resultingin a net gain of 0. The quota_change information is recorded in the qcbuffer (and qd element of the inode as well). The buffer is added to thetransaction by the first call to do_qc, but a subsequent call changesthe value from non-zero back to zero. At that point it's too late toremove the buffer_head from the transaction. Later, when the quota synccode is called, the zero-change qd element is discovered and flagged asan assert warning. If the fs is mounted with errors=panic, the kernelwill panic.This is usually seen when files are truncated and the quota changes arenegated by punch_hole/truncate which uses gfs2_quota_hold andgfs2_quota_unhold rather than block allocations that use gfs2_quota_lockand gfs2_quota_unlock which automatically do quota sync.This patch solves the problem by adding a check to qd_check_sync suchthat net-zero quota changes already added to the transaction are nolonger deemed necessary to be synced, and skipped.In this case references are taken for the qd and the slot from do_qcso those need to be put. The normal sequence of events for a normalnon-zero quota change is as follows:gfs2_quota_change   do_qc      qd_hold      slot_holdLater, when the changes are to be synced:gfs2_quota_sync   qd_fish      qd_check_sync         gets qd ref via lockref_get_not_dead   do_sync      do_qc(QC_SYNC)         qd_put\t    lockref_put_or_lock   qd_unlock      qd_put         lockref_put_or_lockIn the net-zero change case, we add a check to qd_check_sync so it putsthe qd and slot references acquired in gfs2_quota_change and skip theunneeded sync.",
