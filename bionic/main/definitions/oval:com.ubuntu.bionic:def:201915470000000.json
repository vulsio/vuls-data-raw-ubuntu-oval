		"title": "CVE-2019-1547 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low",
		"description": "Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this isused in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it ispossible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using anamed curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not havethe cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match aknown named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back tonon-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recoveryduring an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attackerwould have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number ofsignatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in useby an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is notvulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-1547` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.1 - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.6\nopenssl - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.4\nopenssl1.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.4\nNo subscription required",
