		"description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi packagematrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated InstantMessaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.33.2 \"Push rules\" canspecify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`,which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certainpatterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading toa denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue ispatched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might be to prevent usersfrom making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at areverse-proxy.",
