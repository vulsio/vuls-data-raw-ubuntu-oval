    "Title": "CVE-2021-44733 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object. It was discovered that the ARM Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-44733` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-aws - 4.15.0-1124.133\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-aws - 5.4.0-1069.73~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-azure - 4.15.0-1134.147\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-azure - 5.4.0-1073.76~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-dell300x - 4.15.0-1038.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-gcp - 4.15.0-1119.133\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gcp - 5.4.0-1068.72~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gke - 5.4.0-1066.69~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gkeop - 5.4.0-1037.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1110-kvm - 4.15.0-1110.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1090-oracle - 4.15.0-1090.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-oracle - 5.4.0-1067.72~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1056-raspi - 5.4.0-1056.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1106-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1106.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-generic - 4.15.0-173.182\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-173-lowlatency - 4.15.0-173.182\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-aws - 4.15.0-1124.133\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1069-aws - 5.4.0-1069.73~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-azure - 4.15.0-1134.147\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-azure - 5.4.0-1073.76~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1038-dell300x - 4.15.0-1038.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1119-gcp - 4.15.0-1119.133\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1068-gcp - 5.4.0-1068.72~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gke - 5.4.0-1066.69~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gkeop - 5.4.0-1037.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-generic - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-105-lowlatency - 5.4.0-105.119~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1090-oracle - 4.15.0-1090.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1067-oracle - 5.4.0-1067.72~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1123-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1123.132\nNo subscription required",
