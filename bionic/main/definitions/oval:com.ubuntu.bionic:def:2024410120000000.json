		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detectedWhen fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock withdo_lock_file_wait().However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lockwhile denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail toremove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a rangein the middle).After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur inlock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be usedto read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed toreliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file andfiles_struct and is also used by filp_flush().",
