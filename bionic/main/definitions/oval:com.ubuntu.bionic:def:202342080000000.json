		"title": "CVE-2023-4208 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high",
		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Whenu32_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result structis always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problemwhen updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is alwayscalled on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt ofthe still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to ause-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4208` to fix the vulnerability.
