Assumed that theconnection has been registered in a link group by smc_conn_create() but thermb_desc has not yet been initialized by smc_buf_create(), thus causing theillegal access to conn->rmb_desc. So fix it by checking before dump.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26615` to fix the vulnerability.
