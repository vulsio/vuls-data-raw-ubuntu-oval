		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: hwmon:(mlxreg-fan) Return non-zero value when fan current state is enforced fromsysfs Fan speed minimum can be enforced from sysfs. For example, settingcurrent fan speed to 20 is used to enforce fan speed to be at 100% speed,19 - to be not below 90% speed, etcetera. This feature provides ability tolimit fan speed according to some system wise considerations, like absenceof some replaceable units or high system ambient temperature. Request forchanging fan minimum speed is configuration request and can be set onlythrough 'sysfs' write procedure. In this situation value of argument'state' is above nominal fan speed maximum. Return non-zero code in thiscase to avoid thermal_cooling_device_stats_update() call, because in thiscase statistics update violates thermal statistics table range. The issuesis observed in case kernel is configured with optionCONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS. Here is the trace from KASAN: [ 159.506659] BUG:KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in thermal_cooling_device_stats_update+0x7d/0xb0[ 159.516016] Read of size 4 at addr ffff888116163840 by taskhw-management.s/7444 [ 159.545625] Call Trace: [ 159.548366]dump_stack+0x92/0xc1 [ 159.552084] ?thermal_cooling_device_stats_update+0x7d/0xb0 [ 159.635869]thermal_zone_device_update+0x345/0x780 [ 159.688711]thermal_zone_device_set_mode+0x7d/0xc0 [ 159.694174]mlxsw_thermal_modules_init+0x48f/0x590 [mlxsw_core] [ 159.700972] ?mlxsw_thermal_set_cur_state+0x5a0/0x5a0 [mlxsw_core] [ 159.731827]mlxsw_thermal_init+0x763/0x880 [mlxsw_core] [ 160.070233] RIP:0033:0x7fd995909970 [ 160.074239] Code: 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d 28 d5 2b 00 f7 d864 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 0f 1f 44 00 00 83 3d 99 2d 2c 00 00 75 10 b8 0100 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 01 f0 ff ..
