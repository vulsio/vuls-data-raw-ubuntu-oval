If this attemptfails due to a hardware or firmware problem, there is a chance that theSCLP facility might store data into buffers referenced by the originaloperation at a later time.Handle this situation by not releasing the referenced data buffers ifthe halt attempt fails. For current use cases, this might result in aleak of few pages of memory in case of a rare hardware/firmwaremalfunction.",
