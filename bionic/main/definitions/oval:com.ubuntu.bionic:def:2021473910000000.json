		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/cma: Ensure rdma_addr_cancel() happens before issuing more requestsThe FSM can run in a circle allowing rdma_resolve_ip() to be called twiceon the same id_priv. While this cannot happen without going through thework, it violates the invariant that the same address resolution backgroundrequest cannot be active twice. CPU 1 CPU 2 rdma_resolve_addr():RDMA_CM_IDLE -> RDMA_CM_ADDR_QUERY rdma_resolve_ip(addr_handler) #1process_one_req(): for #1 addr_handler(): RDMA_CM_ADDR_QUERY ->RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND mutex_unlock(&id_priv->handler_mutex); [.. handler stillrunning ..] rdma_resolve_addr(): RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND -> RDMA_CM_ADDR_QUERYrdma_resolve_ip(addr_handler) !! two requests are now on the req_listrdma_destroy_id(): destroy_id_handler_unlock(): _destroy_id():cma_cancel_operation(): rdma_addr_cancel() // process_one_req() selfremoves it spin_lock_bh(&lock); cancel_delayed_work(&req->work); if(!list_empty(&req->list)) == true ! rdma_addr_cancel() returns afterprocess_on_req #1 is done kfree(id_priv) process_one_req(): for #2addr_handler(): mutex_lock(&id_priv->handler_mutex); !! Use after free onid_priv rdma_addr_cancel() expects there to be one req on the list and onlycancels the first one. The self-removal behavior of the work only happensafter the handler has returned. This yields a situations where the req_listcan have two reqs for the same \"handle\" but rdma_addr_cancel() only cancelsthe first one. The second req remains active beyond rdma_destroy_id() andwill use-after-free id_priv once it inevitably triggers. Fix this byremembering if the id_priv has called rdma_resolve_ip() and always cancelbefore calling it again. This ensures the req_list never gets more than oneitem in it and doesn't cost anything in the normal flow that never usesthis strange error path.",
