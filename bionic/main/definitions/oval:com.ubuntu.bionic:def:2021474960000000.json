		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/tls: Fix flipped sign in tls_err_abort() calls sk->sk_err appears toexpect a positive value, a convention that ktls doesn't always follow andthat leads to memory corruption in other code. For instance, [kworker]tls_encrypt_done(..., err=<negative error from crypto request>)tls_err_abort(.., err) sk->sk_err = err; [task] splice_from_pipe_feed ...tls_sw_do_sendpage if (sk->sk_err) { ret = -sk->sk_err; // ret is positivesplice_from_pipe_feed (continued) ret = actor(...) // ret is still positiveand interpreted as bytes // written, resulting in underflow of buf->len and// sd->len, leading to huge buf->offset and bogus // addresses computed inlater calls to actor() Fix all tls_err_abort() callers to pass a negativeerror code consistently and centralize the error-prone sign flip there,throwing in a warning to catch future misuse and uninlining the function soit really does only warn once.",
