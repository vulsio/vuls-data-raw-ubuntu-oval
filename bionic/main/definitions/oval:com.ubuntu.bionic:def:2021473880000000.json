		"title": "CVE-2021-47388 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mac80211: fix use-after-free in CCMP/GCMP RX When PN checking is done inmac80211, for fragmentation we need to copy the PN to the RX struct so wecan later use it to do a comparison, since commit bf30ca922a0c (\"mac80211:check defrag PN against current frame\"). Unfortunately, in that commit Iused the 'hdr' variable without it being necessarily valid, souse-after-free could occur if it was necessary to reallocate (parts of) theframe. Fix this by reloading the variable after the code that results inthe reallocations, if any. This fixeshttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214401.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47388` to fix the vulnerability.
