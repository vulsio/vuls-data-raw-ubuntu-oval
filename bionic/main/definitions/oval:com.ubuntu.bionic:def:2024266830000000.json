		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe respWe recently added some validation that we don't try toconnect to an AP that is currently in a channel switchprocess, since that might want the channel to be quietor we might not be able to connect in time to hear theswitching in a beacon. This was in commit c09c4f31998b(\"wifi: mac80211: don't connect to an AP while it's ina CSA process\").However, we promptly got a report that this caused newconnection failures, and it turns out that the AP thatwe now cannot connect to is permanently advertising anextended channel switch announcement, even with quiet.The AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, with firmware3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898.As a first step, attempt to detect that we're dealingwith such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later.",
