		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageTypeThe current folio_test_hugetlb() can be fooled by a concurrent folio splitinto returning true for a folio which has never belonged to hugetlbfs.This can't happen if the caller holds a refcount on it, but we have a fewplaces (memory-failure, compaction, procfs) which do not and should nottake a speculative reference.Since hugetlb pages do not use individual page mapcounts (they are alwaysfully mapped and use the entire_mapcount field to record the number ofmappings), the PageType field is available now that page_mapcount()ignores the value in this field.In compaction and with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, the current implementationcan result in an oops, as reported by Luis. This happens since 9c5ccf2db04b(\"mm: remove HUGETLB_PAGE_DTOR\") effectively added some VM_BUG_ON() checksin the PageHuge() testing path.[willy@infradead.org: update vmcoreinfo]  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/ZgGZUvsdhaT1Va-T@casper.infradead.org",
