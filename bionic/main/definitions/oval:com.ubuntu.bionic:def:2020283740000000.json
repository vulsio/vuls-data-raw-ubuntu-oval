		"Title": "CVE-2020-28374 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high",
		"Description": "In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7,insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code can be used byremote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPYrequest, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over anetwork if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gainscontrol over file access because I/O operations are proxied via anattacker-selected backstore.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-28374` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-132-generic - 4.15.0-132.136\nlinux-image-4.15.0-132-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-132.136\nlinux-image-4.15.0-132-lowlatency - 4.15.0-132.136\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-132-generic - 4.15.0-132.136\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-132-lowlatency - 4.15.0-132.136\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-70-generic - 5.3.0-70.66\nlinux-image-5.3.0-70-lowlatency - 5.3.0-70.66\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-70-generic - 5.3.0-70.66\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-70-lowlatency - 5.3.0-70.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-62-generic - 5.4.0-62.70~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-62-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-62.70~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-62-lowlatency - 5.4.0-62.70~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-62-generic - 5.4.0-62.70~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-62-lowlatency - 5.4.0-62.70~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1084-kvm - 4.15.0-1084.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1093-aws - 4.15.0-1093.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1037-aws - 5.4.0-1037.39~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-azure - 4.15.0-1106.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-azure - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1092-gcp - 4.15.0-1092.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1036-gcp - 5.4.0-1036.39~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-gke - 4.15.0-1078.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1051-gke - 5.0.0-1051.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1040-gke - 5.3.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1035-gke - 5.4.0-1035.37~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1009-gkeop - 5.4.0-1009.10~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1064-oracle - 4.15.0-1064.71\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-oracle - 5.4.0-1037.40~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1078-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1078.83\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1037-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1037.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1028-raspi - 5.4.0-1028.31~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1095-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1095.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1011-dell300x - 4.15.0-1011.15\nNo subscription required",
