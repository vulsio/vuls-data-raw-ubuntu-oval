After returning to -ENOSPC, reserved_blocks += retwill not be executed. As a result, the reserved_blocks at this time isstill 0, which is not the real number of reserved blocks. Therefore, fsckcannot be set to repair the file. After this patch, the fsck flag will beset to fix this problem. unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48 112G112G 1.8M 100% /data unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apkF2FS_IOC_RESERVE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS failed: No space left on device adb rebootthen fsck will be executed unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48112G 112G 11M 100% /data unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk 924",
