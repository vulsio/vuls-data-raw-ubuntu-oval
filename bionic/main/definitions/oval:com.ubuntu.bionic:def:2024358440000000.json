After returningto -ENOSPC, reserved_blocks += ret will not be executed. As a result,the reserved_blocks at this time is still 0, which is not the realnumber of reserved blocks. Therefore, fsck cannot be set to repairthe file.After this patch, the fsck flag will be set to fix this problem.unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48/dev/block/dm-48             112G 112G  1.8M 100% /dataunisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apkF2FS_IOC_RESERVE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS failed: No space left on deviceadb reboot then fsck will be executedunisoc # df -h  | grep dm-48/dev/block/dm-48             112G 112G   11M 100% /dataunisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk924",
