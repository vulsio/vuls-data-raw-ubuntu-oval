		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entitySyzbot found a GPF in reweight_entity. This has been bisected tocommit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (\"kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalidsched_task_group\")There is a race between sched_post_fork() and setpriority(PRIO_PGRP)within a thread group that causes a null-ptr-deref inreweight_entity() in CFS. The scenario is that the main process spawnsnumber of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),wait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() getsinvoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()for it.In the above scenario there is a possibility thatsetpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a threadin the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and forwhich the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet. This willtrigger a null pointer dereference in reweight_entity(), as it willtry to access the run queue pointer, which hasn't been set.Before the mentioned change the cfs_rq pointer for the task  has beenset in sched_fork(), which is called much earlier in copy_process(),before the new task is added to the thread_group.  Now it is done inthe sched_post_fork(), which is called after that.  To fix the issuethe remove the update_load param from the update_load param() functionand call reweight_task() only if the task flag doesn't have theTASK_NEW flag set.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48921` to fix the vulnerability.
