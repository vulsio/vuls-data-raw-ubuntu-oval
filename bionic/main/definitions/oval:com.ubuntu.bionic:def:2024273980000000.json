		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by sco_sock_timeout When the scoconnection is established and then, the sco socket is releasing,timeout_work will be scheduled to judge whether the sco disconnection istimeout. The sock will be deallocated later, but it is dereferenced againin sco_sock_timeout. As a result, the use-after-free bugs will happen.
