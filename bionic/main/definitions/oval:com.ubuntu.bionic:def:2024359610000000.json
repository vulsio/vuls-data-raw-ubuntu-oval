		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Register devlink first under devlink lock In case device ishaving a non fatal FW error during probe, the driver will report the errorto user via devlink. This will trigger a WARN_ON, since mlx5 is callingdevlink_register() last. In order to avoid the WARN_ON[1], change mlx5 toinvoke devl_register() first under devlink lock.
