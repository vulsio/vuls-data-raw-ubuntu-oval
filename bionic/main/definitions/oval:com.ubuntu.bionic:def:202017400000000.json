When a user executes \"ansible-vault edit\", another user onthe same computer can read the old and new secret, as it is created in atemporary file with mkstemp and the returned file descriptor is closed andthe method write_data is called to write the existing secret in the file.This method will delete the file before recreating it insecurely.
