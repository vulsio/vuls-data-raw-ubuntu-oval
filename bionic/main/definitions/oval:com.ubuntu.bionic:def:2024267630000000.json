		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm-crypt: don't modify the data when using authenticated encryption It wassaid that authenticated encryption could produce invalid tag when the datathat is being encrypted is modified [1]. So, fix this problem by copyingthe data into the clone bio first and then encrypt them inside the clonebio. This may reduce performance, but it is needed to prevent the user fromcorrupting the device by writing data with O_DIRECT and modifying them atthe same time.
