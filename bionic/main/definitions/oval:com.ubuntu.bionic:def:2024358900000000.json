		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: gro:fix ownership transfer If packets are GROed with fraglist they might besegmented later on and continue their journey in the stack. Inskb_segment_list those skbs can be reused as-is. This is an issue as theirdestructor was removed in skb_gro_receive_list but not the reference totheir socket, and then they can't be orphaned. Fix this by also removingthe reference to the socket. For example this could be observed, kernel BUGat include/linux/skbuff.h:3131!
