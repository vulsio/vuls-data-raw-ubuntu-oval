		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs:sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection() Thesysfs_break_active_protection() routine has an obvious reference leak inits error path. If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails then kn will beNULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection() routine won't getcalled (and would only cause an access violation by trying to dereferencekn->parent if it was called). As a result, the reference to kobj acquiredat the start of the function will never be released. Fix the leak by addingan explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26993` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1133-azure - 5.4.0-1133.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-gcp - 5.4.0-1132.141~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-ibm - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-oracle - 5.4.0-1127.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
