		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:USB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in thedescriptorSyzbot has identified a bug in usbcore (see the Closes: tag below)caused by our assumption that the reserved bits in an endpointdescriptor's bEndpointAddress field will always be 0.  As a result ofthe bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possiblyother routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are fordistinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction andendpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bugidentified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbersand directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).To fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddresswhen we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1specs say these bits are \"Reserved, reset to zero\".)  This requires usto make a copy of the descriptor earlier in usb_parse_endpoint() anduse the copy instead of the original when checking for duplicates.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41035` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-generic - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-lowlatency - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-aws - 5.4.0-1132.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1137-azure - 5.4.0-1137.144~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1136-gcp - 5.4.0-1136.145~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-ibm - 5.4.0-1079.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1131-oracle - 5.4.0-1131.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
