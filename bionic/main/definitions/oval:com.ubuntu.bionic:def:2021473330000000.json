		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridgeThere is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,bus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL.Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link'sASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later byalcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can dohere is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simplyreturn when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.[    1.246492] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:00000000000000c0[    1.248731] RIP: 0010:pci_read_config_byte+0x5/0x40[    1.253998] Call Trace:[    1.254131]  ? alcor_pci_find_cap_offset.isra.0+0x3a/0x100 [alcor_pci][    1.254476]  alcor_pci_probe+0x169/0x2d5 [alcor_pci]",
