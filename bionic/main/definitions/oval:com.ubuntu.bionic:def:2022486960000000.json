		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:regmap: spi: Reserve space for register address/paddingCurrently the max_raw_read and max_raw_write limits in regmap_spi structdo not take into account the additional size of the transmitted registeraddress and padding.  This may result in exceeding the maximum permittedSPI message size, which could cause undefined behaviour, e.g. datacorruption.Fix regmap_get_spi_bus() to properly adjust the above mentioned limitsby reserving space for the register address/padding as set in the regmapconfiguration.",
