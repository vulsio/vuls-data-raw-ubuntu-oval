		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUsUse the kvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when encryptingVMSAs for SEV, which effectively switches to use online_vcpus instead ofcreated_vcpus.  This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference ascreated_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists, since it is updated atthe very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  created_vcpus exists to allow thebulk of vCPU creation to run in parallel, while still correctlyrestricting the max number of max vCPUs.",
