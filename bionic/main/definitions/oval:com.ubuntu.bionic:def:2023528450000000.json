If a link name which is not null-terminated is passed throughnetlink, strstr() and similar functions can cause buffer overrun. Thiscauses the above issue.This patch changes the nla_policy for bearer-related names from NLA_STRINGto NLA_NUL_STRING. This resolves the issue by ensuring that onlynull-terminated strings are accepted as bearer-related names.syzbot reported similar uninit-value issue related to bearer names [2]. Theroot cause of this issue is that a non-null-terminated bearer name waspassed. This patch also resolved this issue.",
