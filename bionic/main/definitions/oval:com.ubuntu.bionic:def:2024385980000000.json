Fix this problemby always set returned blocks from md_bitmap_get_counter\"(), as it used tobe. Noted that this patch just fix the softlockup problem in kernel, thecase that bitmap size doesn't match array size still need to be fixed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38598` to fix the vulnerability.
