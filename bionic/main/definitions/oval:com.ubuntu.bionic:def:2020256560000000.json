    "Title": "CVE-2020-25656 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free was found in the way the console subsystem was using ioctls KDGKBSENT and KDSKBSENT. A local user could use this flaw to get read memory access out of bounds. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. It was discovered that the console keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25656` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-lowlatency - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-129-generic - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-129-lowlatency - 4.15.0-129.132\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1091-aws - 4.15.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1034-aws - 5.4.0-1034.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1103-azure - 4.15.0-1103.114\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1035-azure - 5.4.0-1035.36~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1010-dell300x - 4.15.0-1010.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-gcp - 4.15.0-1091.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gcp - 5.4.0-1033.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1077-gke - 4.15.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-59-generic - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-59-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-59-lowlatency - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-59-generic - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-59-lowlatency - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1082-kvm - 4.15.0-1082.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1062-oracle - 4.15.0-1062.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-oracle - 5.4.0-1034.36~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1026-raspi - 5.4.0-1026.29~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1077-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-4.15.0-129-lowlatency - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-129-generic - 4.15.0-129.132\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-129-lowlatency - 4.15.0-129.132\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1091-aws - 4.15.0-1091.96\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1034-aws - 5.4.0-1034.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1103-azure - 4.15.0-1103.114\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1035-azure - 5.4.0-1035.36~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1010-dell300x - 4.15.0-1010.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-gcp - 4.15.0-1091.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gcp - 5.4.0-1033.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1077-gke - 4.15.0-1077.82\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-gke - 5.4.0-1033.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1008-gkeop - 5.4.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-59-generic - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-59-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-59-lowlatency - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-59-generic - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-59-lowlatency - 5.4.0-59.65~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1062-oracle - 4.15.0-1062.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1034-oracle - 5.4.0-1034.36~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1094-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1094.103\nNo subscription required",
