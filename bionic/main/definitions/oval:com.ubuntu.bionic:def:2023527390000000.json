Sometimes, it would also show up ascorruption in the free list pointer and cause crashes. After bisecting theissue, we found the issue started from commit e320d3012d25(\"mm/page_alloc.c: fix freeing non-compound pages\"): if(put_page_testzero(page)) free_the_page(page, order); else if(!PageHead(page)) while (order-- > 0) free_the_page(page + (1 << order),order); So the problem is the check PageHead is racy because at this pointwe already dropped our reference to the page. So even if we came in withcompound page, the page can already be freed and PageHead can return falseand we will end up freeing all the tail pages causing double free.",
