		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bonding: change ipsec_lock from spin lock to mutexIn the cited commit, bond->ipsec_lock is added to protect ipsec_list,hence xdo_dev_state_add and xdo_dev_state_delete are called insidethis lock. As ipsec_lock is a spin lock and such xfrmdev ops may sleep,\"scheduling while atomic\" will be triggered when changing bond'sactive slave.[  101.055189] BUG: scheduling while atomic: bash/902/0x00000200[  101.055726] Modules linked in:[  101.058211] CPU: 3 PID: 902 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.9.0-rc4+ #1[  101.058760] Hardware name:[  101.059434] Call Trace:[  101.059436]  <TASK>[  101.060873]  dump_stack_lvl+0x51/0x60[  101.061275]  __schedule_bug+0x4e/0x60[  101.061682]  __schedule+0x612/0x7c0[  101.062078]  ? __mod_timer+0x25c/0x370[  101.062486]  schedule+0x25/0xd0[  101.062845]  schedule_timeout+0x77/0xf0[  101.063265]  ? asm_common_interrupt+0x22/0x40[  101.063724]  ? __bpf_trace_itimer_state+0x10/0x10[  101.064215]  __wait_for_common+0x87/0x190[  101.064648]  ? usleep_range_state+0x90/0x90[  101.065091]  cmd_exec+0x437/0xb20 [mlx5_core][  101.065569]  mlx5_cmd_do+0x1e/0x40 [mlx5_core][  101.066051]  mlx5_cmd_exec+0x18/0x30 [mlx5_core][  101.066552]  mlx5_crypto_create_dek_key+0xea/0x120 [mlx5_core][  101.067163]  ? bonding_sysfs_store_option+0x4d/0x80 [bonding][  101.067738]  ? kmalloc_trace+0x4d/0x350[  101.068156]  mlx5_ipsec_create_sa_ctx+0x33/0x100 [mlx5_core][  101.068747]  mlx5e_xfrm_add_state+0x47b/0xaa0 [mlx5_core][  101.069312]  bond_change_active_slave+0x392/0x900 [bonding][  101.069868]  bond_option_active_slave_set+0x1c2/0x240 [bonding][  101.070454]  __bond_opt_set+0xa6/0x430 [bonding][  101.070935]  __bond_opt_set_notify+0x2f/0x90 [bonding][  101.071453]  bond_opt_tryset_rtnl+0x72/0xb0 [bonding][  101.071965]  bonding_sysfs_store_option+0x4d/0x80 [bonding][  101.072567]  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x10c/0x1a0[  101.073033]  vfs_write+0x2d8/0x400[  101.073416]  ? alloc_fd+0x48/0x180[  101.073798]  ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0[  101.074175]  do_syscall_64+0x52/0x110[  101.074576]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53As bond_ipsec_add_sa_all and bond_ipsec_del_sa_all are only calledfrom bond_change_active_slave, which requires holding the RTNL lock.And bond_ipsec_add_sa and bond_ipsec_del_sa are xfrm statexdo_dev_state_add and xdo_dev_state_delete APIs, which are in usercontext. So ipsec_lock doesn't have to be spin lock, change it tomutex, and thus the above issue can be resolved.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46678` to fix the vulnerability.
