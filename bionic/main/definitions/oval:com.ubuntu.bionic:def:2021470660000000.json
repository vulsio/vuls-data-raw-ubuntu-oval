		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:async_xor: increase src_offs when dropping destination pageNow we support sharing one page if PAGE_SIZE is not equal stripe size. Tosupport this, it needs to support calculating xor value with differentoffsets for each r5dev. One offset array is used to record those offsets.In RMW mode, parity page is used as a source page. It setsASYNC_TX_XOR_DROP_DST before calculating xor value in ops_run_prexor5.So it needs to add src_list and src_offs at the same time. Now it onlyneeds src_list. So the xor value which is calculated is wrong. It cancause data corruption problem.I can reproduce this problem 100% on a POWER8 machine. The steps are:  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --size=3G  mkfs.xfs /dev/md0  mount /dev/md0 /mnt/test  mount: /mnt/test: mount(2) system call failed: Structure needs cleaning.",
