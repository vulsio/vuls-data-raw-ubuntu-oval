		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: efi:runtime: avoid EFIv2 runtime services on Apple x86 machines Aditya reports[0] that his recent MacbookPro crashes in the firmware when using thevariable services at runtime. The culprit appears to be a call toQueryVariableInfo(), which we did not use to call on Apple x86 machines inthe past as they only upgraded from EFI v1.10 to EFI v2.40 firmware fairlyrecently, and QueryVariableInfo() (along with UpdateCapsule() et al) wasadded in EFI v2.00. The only runtime service introduced in EFI v2.00 thatwe actually use in Linux is QueryVariableInfo(), as the capsule based onesare optional, generally not used at runtime (all the LVFS/fwupd firmwareupdate infrastructure uses helper EFI programs that invoke capsule updateat boot time, not runtime), and not implemented by Apple machines in thefirst place. QueryVariableInfo() is used to 'safely' set variables, i.e.,only when there is enough space. This prevents machines with buggyfirmwares from corrupting their NVRAMs when they run out of space. Giventhat Apple machines have been using EFI v1.10 services only for the longesttime (the EFI v2.0 spec was released in 2006, and Linux support for thenewly introduced runtime services was added in 2011, but the MacbookPro12,1released in 2015 still claims to be EFI v1.10 only), let's avoid the EFIv2.0 ones on all Apple x86 machines.
