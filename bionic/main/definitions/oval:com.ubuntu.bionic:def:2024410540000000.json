		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: ufs: core: Fix ufshcd_clear_cmd racing issueWhen ufshcd_clear_cmd is racing with the completion ISR, the completed tagof the request's mq_hctx pointer will be set to NULL by the ISR.  Andufshcd_clear_cmd's call to ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq will get NULL pointer KE.Return success when the request is completed by ISR because sq does notneed cleanup.The racing flow is:Thread Aufshcd_err_handler\t\t\t\t\tstep 1\tufshcd_try_to_abort_task\t\tufshcd_cmd_inflight(true)\t\tstep 3\t\tufshcd_clear_cmd\t\t\t...\t\t\tufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq\t\t\tblk_mq_unique_tag\t\t\t\trq->mq_hctx->queue_num\tstep 5Thread Bufs_mtk_mcq_intr(cq complete ISR)\t\t\tstep 2\tscsi_done\t\t...\t\t__blk_mq_free_request\t\t\trq->mq_hctx = NULL;\t\tstep 4Below is KE back trace:  ufshcd_try_to_abort_task: cmd pending in the device. tag = 6  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address0000000000000194   pc : [0xffffffd589679bf8] blk_mq_unique_tag+0x8/0x14   lr : [0xffffffd5862f95b4] ufshcd_mcq_sq_cleanup+0x6c/0x1cc[ufs_mediatek_mod_ise]   Workqueue: ufs_eh_wq_0 ufshcd_err_handler [ufs_mediatek_mod_ise]   Call trace:    dump_backtrace+0xf8/0x148    show_stack+0x18/0x24    dump_stack_lvl+0x60/0x7c    dump_stack+0x18/0x3c    mrdump_common_die+0x24c/0x398 [mrdump]    ipanic_die+0x20/0x34 [mrdump]    notify_die+0x80/0xd8    die+0x94/0x2b8    __do_kernel_fault+0x264/0x298    do_page_fault+0xa4/0x4b8    do_translation_fault+0x38/0x54    do_mem_abort+0x58/0x118    el1_abort+0x3c/0x5c    el1h_64_sync_handler+0x54/0x90    el1h_64_sync+0x68/0x6c    blk_mq_unique_tag+0x8/0x14    ufshcd_clear_cmd+0x34/0x118 [ufs_mediatek_mod_ise]    ufshcd_try_to_abort_task+0x2c8/0x5b4 [ufs_mediatek_mod_ise]    ufshcd_err_handler+0xa7c/0xfa8 [ufs_mediatek_mod_ise]    process_one_work+0x208/0x4fc    worker_thread+0x228/0x438    kthread+0x104/0x1d4    ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20",
