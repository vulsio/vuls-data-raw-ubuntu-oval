		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:jfs: xattr: fix buffer overflow for invalid xattrWhen an xattr size is not what is expected, it is printed out to thekernel log in hex format as a form of debugging.  But when that xattrsize is bigger than the expected size, printing it out can cause anaccess off the end of the buffer.Fix this all up by properly restricting the size of the debug hex dumpin the kernel log.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40902` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-generic - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-lowlatency - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-aws - 5.4.0-1132.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1137-azure - 5.4.0-1137.144~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1136-gcp - 5.4.0-1136.145~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-ibm - 5.4.0-1079.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1131-oracle - 5.4.0-1131.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
