		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soc: xilinx: rename cpu_number1 to dummy_cpu_numberThe per cpu variable cpu_number1 is passed to xlnx_event_handler asargument \"dev_id\", but it is not used in this function. So drop theinitialization of this variable and rename it to dummy_cpu_number.This patch is to fix the following call trace when the kernel optionCONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is enabled:BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context atinclude/linux/sched/mm.h:274    in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 1, name:swapper/0    preempt_count: 1, expected: 0    CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 6.1.0 #53    Hardware name: Xilinx Versal vmk180 Eval board rev1.1 (QSPI) (DT)    Call trace:     dump_backtrace+0xd0/0xe0     show_stack+0x18/0x40     dump_stack_lvl+0x7c/0xa0     dump_stack+0x18/0x34     __might_resched+0x10c/0x140     __might_sleep+0x4c/0xa0     __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0xf4/0x168     kmalloc_trace+0x28/0x38     __request_percpu_irq+0x74/0x138     xlnx_event_manager_probe+0xf8/0x298     platform_probe+0x68/0xd8",
