		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:interconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulated Theicc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lock mutexes in[1] to avoid lockdep splats. However, this didn't adequately protect accessto icc_node::req_list. The icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterateover req_list while only holding icc_bw_lock, but req_list can be modifiedwhile only holding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw(),of_icc_get(), and icc_put(). Example A: CPU0 CPU1 ---- ----icc_set_bw(path_a) mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock); icc_put(path_b)mutex_lock(&icc_lock); aggregate_requests() hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...hlist_del(... <r = invalid pointer> Example B: CPU0 CPU1 ---- ----icc_set_bw(path_a) mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock); path_b = of_icc_get()of_icc_get_by_index() mutex_lock(&icc_lock); path_find() path_init()aggregate_requests() hlist_for_each_entry(r, ... hlist_add_head(... <r =invalid pointer> Fix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held beforemanipulating icc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is helddon't perform any memory allocations, so we should still be safe from theoriginal lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.
