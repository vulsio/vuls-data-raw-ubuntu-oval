		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:sun6i: reduce DMA RX transfer width to single byte Through empiricaltesting it has been determined that sometimes RX SPI transfers with DMAenabled return corrupted data. This is down to single or even multiplebytes lost during DMA transfer from SPI peripheral to memory. It seems theRX FIFO within the SPI peripheral can become confused when performing busread accesses wider than a single byte to it during an active SPI transfer.This patch reduces the width of individual DMA read accesses to the RX FIFOto a single byte to mitigate that issue.",
