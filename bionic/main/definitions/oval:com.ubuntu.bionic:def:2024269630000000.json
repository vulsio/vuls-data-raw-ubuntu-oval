		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior As runtime PM is enabled, themodule can be runtime suspended when .remove() is called. Do apm_runtime_get_sync() to make sure module is active before doing anyregister operations. Doing a pm_runtime_put_sync() should disable therefclk so no need to disable it again. Fixes the below warning at moduleremovel.

Get rid of the now unnnecessarydwc3_ti_remove_core(). Without this, module re-load doesn't work properly.",
