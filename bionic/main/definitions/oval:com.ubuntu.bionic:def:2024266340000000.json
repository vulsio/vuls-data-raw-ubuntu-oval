		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames Mark reports a BUG()when a net namespace is removed. kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:11520!Physical interfaces moved outside of init_net get \"refunded\" to init_netwhen that namespace disappears. The main interface name may get overwrittenin the process if it would have conflicted. We need to also discard allconflicting altnames. Recent fixes addressed ensuring that altnames getmoved with the main interface, which surfaced this problem.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26634` to fix the vulnerability.
