		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: Fix potential data-race in __nft_flowtable_type_get()nft_unregister_flowtable_type() within nf_flow_inet_module_exit() canconcurrent with __nft_flowtable_type_get() within nf_tables_newflowtable().And thhere is not any protection when iterate over nf_tables_flowtableslist in __nft_flowtable_type_get(). Therefore, there is pertentialdata-race of nf_tables_flowtables list entry. Use list_for_each_entry_rcu()to iterate over nf_tables_flowtables list in __nft_flowtable_type_get(),and use rcu_read_lock() in the caller nft_flowtable_type_get() to protectthe entire type query process.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35898` to fix the vulnerability.
