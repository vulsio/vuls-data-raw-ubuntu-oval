		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md/raid1: Fix data corruption for degraded array with slow diskread_balance() will avoid reading from slow disks as much as possible,however, if valid data only lands in slow disks, and a new normal diskis still in recovery, unrecovered data can be read:raid1_read_request read_balance  raid1_should_read_first  -> return false  choose_best_rdev  -> normal disk is not recovered, return -1  choose_bb_rdev  -> missing the checking of recovery, return the normal disk -> read unrecovered dataRoot cause is that the checking of recovery is missing inchoose_bb_rdev(). Hence add such checking to fix the problem.Also fix similar problem in choose_slow_rdev().",
