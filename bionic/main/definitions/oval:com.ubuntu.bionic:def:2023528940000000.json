		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: f_ncm: fix potential NULL ptr deref in ncm_bitrate()In Google internal bug 265639009 we've received an (as yet) unreproduciblecrash report from an aarch64 GKI 5.10.149-android13 running device.AFAICT the source code is at:https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/tags/ASB-2022-12-05_13-5.10The call stack is:  ncm_close() -> ncm_notify() -> ncm_do_notify()with the crash at:  ncm_do_notify+0x98/0x270Code: 79000d0b b9000a6c f940012a f9400269 (b9405d4b)Which I believe disassembles to (I don't know ARM assembly, but it lookssane enough to me...):  // halfword (16-bit) store presumably to event->wLength (at offset 6 ofstruct usb_cdc_notification)  0B 0D 00 79    strh w11, [x8, #6]  // word (32-bit) store presumably to req->Length (at offset 8 of structusb_request)  6C 0A 00 B9    str  w12, [x19, #8]  // x10 (NULL) was read here from offset 0 of valid pointer x9  // IMHO we're reading 'cdev->gadget' and getting NULL  // gadget is indeed at offset 0 of struct usb_composite_dev  2A 01 40 F9    ldr  x10, [x9]  // loading req->buf pointer, which is at offset 0 of struct usb_request  69 02 40 F9    ldr  x9, [x19]  // x10 is null, crash, appears to be attempt to readcdev->gadget->max_speed  4B 5D 40 B9    ldr  w11, [x10, #0x5c]which seems to line up with ncm_do_notify() case NCM_NOTIFY_SPEED codefragment:  event->wLength = cpu_to_le16(8);  req->length = NCM_STATUS_BYTECOUNT;  /* SPEED_CHANGE data is up/down speeds in bits/sec */  data = req->buf + sizeof *event;  data[0] = cpu_to_le32(ncm_bitrate(cdev->gadget));My analysis of registers and NULL ptr deref crash offset  (Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address000000000000005c)heavily suggests that the crash is due to 'cdev->gadget' being NULL whenexecuting:  data[0] = cpu_to_le32(ncm_bitrate(cdev->gadget));which calls:  ncm_bitrate(NULL)which then calls:  gadget_is_superspeed(NULL)which reads  ((struct usb_gadget *)NULL)->max_speedand hits a panic.AFAICT, if I'm counting right, the offset of max_speed is indeed 0x5C.(remember there's a GKI KABI reservation of 16 bytes in struct work_struct)It's not at all clear to me how this is all supposed to work...but returning 0 seems much better than panic-ing...\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52894` to fix the vulnerability.
