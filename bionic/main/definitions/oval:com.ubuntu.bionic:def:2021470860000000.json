		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phonet/pep: refuse to enable an unbound pipe This ioctl() implicitlyassumed that the socket was already bound to a valid local socket name,i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not bound, two separate problemswould occur: 1) We'd send an pipe enablement request with an invalid sourceobject. 2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket unexpectedly beingconnected yet not bound to a valid object.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47086` to fix the vulnerability.
