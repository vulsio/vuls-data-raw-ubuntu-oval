		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tipc: wait and exit until all work queues are doneOn some host, a crash could be triggered simply by repeating thesecommands several times:  # modprobe tipc  # tipc bearer enable media udp name UDP1 localip 127.0.0.1  # rmmod tipc  [] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffc096bb00  [] Workqueue: events 0xffffffffc096bb00  [] Call Trace:  []  ? process_one_work+0x1a7/0x360  []  ? worker_thread+0x30/0x390  []  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0  []  ? kthread+0x116/0x130  []  ? kthread_flush_work_fn+0x10/0x10  []  ? ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40When removing the TIPC module, the UDP tunnel sock will be delayed torelease in a work queue as sock_release() can't be done in rtnl_lock().If the work queue is schedule to run after the TIPC module is removed,kernel will crash as the work queue function cleanup_beareri() code nolonger exists when trying to invoke it.To fix it, this patch introduce a member wq_count in tipc_net to trackthe numbers of work queues in schedule, and  wait and exit until allwork queues are done in tipc_exit_net().",
