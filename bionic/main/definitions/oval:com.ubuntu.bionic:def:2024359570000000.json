		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Fix WARN_ON in iommu probe path Commit 1a75cc710b95(\"iommu/vt-d: Use rbtree to track iommu probed devices\") adds all devicesprobed by the iommu driver in a rbtree indexed by the source ID of eachdevice. It assumes that each device has a unique source ID. This assumptionis incorrect and the VT-d spec doesn't state this requirement either. Thereason for using a rbtree to track devices is to look up the device withPCI bus and devfunc in the paths of handling ATS invalidation time outerror and the PRI I/O page faults. Both are PCI ATS feature related. Onlytrack the devices that have PCI ATS capabilities in the rbtree to avoidunnecessary WARN_ON in the iommu probe path. Otherwise, on some platformsbelow kernel splat will be displayed and the iommu probe results infailure.
