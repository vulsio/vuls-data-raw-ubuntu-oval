		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix OOB in nilfs_set_de_typeThe size of the nilfs_type_by_mode array in the fs/nilfs2/dir.c file isdefined as \"S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT\", but the nilfs_set_de_type() function,which uses this array, specifies the index to read from the array in thesame way as \"(mode & S_IFMT) >> S_SHIFT\".static void nilfs_set_de_type(struct nilfs_dir_entry *de, struct inode *inode){\tumode_t mode = inode->i_mode;\tde->file_type = nilfs_type_by_mode[(mode & S_IFMT)>>S_SHIFT]; // oob}However, when the index is determined this way, an out-of-bounds (OOB)error occurs by referring to an index that is 1 larger than the array sizewhen the condition \"mode & S_IFMT == S_IFMT\" is satisfied.  Therefore, apatch to resize the nilfs_type_by_mode array should be applied to preventOOB errors.",
