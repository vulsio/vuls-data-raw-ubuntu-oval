		"title": "CVE-2024-26981 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix OOB in nilfs_set_de_type The size of the nilfs_type_by_mode array inthe fs/nilfs2/dir.c file is defined as \"S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT\", but thenilfs_set_de_type() function, which uses this array, specifies the index toread from the array in the same way as \"(mode & S_IFMT) >> S_SHIFT\". staticvoid nilfs_set_de_type(struct nilfs_dir_entry *de, struct inode *inode) {umode_t mode = inode->i_mode; de->file_type = nilfs_type_by_mode[(mode &S_IFMT)>>S_SHIFT]; // oob } However, when the index is determined this way,an out-of-bounds (OOB) error occurs by referring to an index that is 1larger than the array size when the condition \"mode & S_IFMT == S_IFMT\" issatisfied. Therefore, a patch to resize the nilfs_type_by_mode array shouldbe applied to prevent OOB errors.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26981` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1133-azure - 5.4.0-1133.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-gcp - 5.4.0-1132.141~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-ibm - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-oracle - 5.4.0-1127.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
