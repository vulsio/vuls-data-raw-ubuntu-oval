		"Title": "CVE-2019-6690 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "python-gnupg 0.4.3 allows context-dependent attackers to trick gnupg to decrypt other ciphertext than intended. To perform the attack, the passphrase to gnupg must be controlled by the adversary and the ciphertext should be trusted. Related to a \"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\" issue affecting the affect functionality component. It was discovered that python-gnupg incorrectly handled the GPG passphrase. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted passphrase that would allow them to control the output of encryption and decryption operations.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-6690` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-gnupg - 0.4.1-1ubuntu1.18.04.1\npython3-gnupg - 0.4.1-1ubuntu1.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
