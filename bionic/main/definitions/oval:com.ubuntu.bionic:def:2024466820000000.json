		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: prevent panic for nfsv4.0 closed files in nfs4_show_openPrior to commit 3f29cc82a84c (\"nfsd: split sc_status out ofsc_type\") states_show() relied on sc_type field to be of validtype before calling into a subfunction to show content of aparticular stateid. From that commit, we split the validity ofthe stateid into sc_status and no longer changed sc_type to 0while unhashing the stateid. This resulted in kernel oopsingfor nfsv4.0 opens that stay around and in nfs4_show_open()would derefence sc_file which was NULL.Instead, for closed open stateids forgo displaying informationthat relies of having a valid sc_file.To reproduce: mount the server with 4.0, read and closea file and then on the server cat /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/2/states[  513.590804] Call trace:[  513.590925]  _raw_spin_lock+0xcc/0x160[  513.591119]  nfs4_show_open+0x78/0x2c0 [nfsd][  513.591412]  states_show+0x44c/0x488 [nfsd][  513.591681]  seq_read_iter+0x5d8/0x760[  513.591896]  seq_read+0x188/0x208[  513.592075]  vfs_read+0x148/0x470[  513.592241]  ksys_read+0xcc/0x178",
