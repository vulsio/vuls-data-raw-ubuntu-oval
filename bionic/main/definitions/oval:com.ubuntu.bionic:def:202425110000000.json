		"description": "Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can causeunboundedmemory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessionsImpact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations totriggerunbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of ServiceThis problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKEToption isbeing used (but not if early_data support is also configured and thedefaultanti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions,thesession cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flushproperlyas it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unboundedmanner. Amalicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure toforce a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normaloperation.This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affectTLSclients.The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.OpenSSL1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.",
