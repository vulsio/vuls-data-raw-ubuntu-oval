		"Title": "CVE-2022-40768 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "drivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case. Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX storage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-40768` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-197-generic - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-4.15.0-197-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-4.15.0-197-lowlatency - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-197-generic - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-197-lowlatency - 4.15.0-197.208\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1143-aws - 4.15.0-1143.155\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-aws - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-azure - 5.4.0-1095.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1055-dell300x - 4.15.0-1055.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-gcp - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-ibm - 5.4.0-1037.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1129-kvm - 4.15.0-1129.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-oracle - 4.15.0-1108.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-oracle - 5.4.0-1087.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1121-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1121.129\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-197-generic - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-4.15.0-197-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-4.15.0-197-lowlatency - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-197-generic - 4.15.0-197.208\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-197-lowlatency - 4.15.0-197.208\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1143-aws - 4.15.0-1143.155\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-aws - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-azure - 5.4.0-1095.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1055-dell300x - 4.15.0-1055.60\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-gcp - 4.15.0-1138.154\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-gcp - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-ibm - 5.4.0-1037.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1108-oracle - 4.15.0-1108.119\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-oracle - 5.4.0-1087.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1139-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1139.149\nNo subscription required",
