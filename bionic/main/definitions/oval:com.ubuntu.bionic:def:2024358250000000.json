		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: ncm: Fix handling of zero block length packetsWhile connecting to a Linux host with CDC_NCM_NTB_DEF_SIZE_TXset to 65536, it has been observed that we receive short packets,which come at interval of 5-10 seconds sometimes and have blocklength zero but still contain 1-2 valid datagrams present.According to the NCM spec:\"If wBlockLength = 0x0000, the block is terminated by ashort packet. In this case, the USB transfer must stillbe shorter than dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize. Ifexactly dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize bytes are sent,and the size is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize for thegiven pipe, then no ZLP shall be sent.wBlockLength= 0x0000 must be used with extreme care, becauseof the possibility that the host and device may get out ofsync, and because of test issues.wBlockLength = 0x0000 allows the sender to reduce latency bystarting to send a very large NTB, and then shortening it whenthe sender discovers that thereâ€™s not sufficient data to justifysending a large NTB\"However, there is a potential issue with the current implementation,as it checks for the occurrence of multiple NTBs in a singlegiveback by verifying if the leftover bytes to be processed is zeroor not. If the block length reads zero, we would process the sameNTB infintely because the leftover bytes is never zero and it leadsto a crash. Fix this by bailing out if block length reads zero.",
