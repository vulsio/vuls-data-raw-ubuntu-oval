		"Title": "CVE-2021-3659 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networking subsystem in the way the user closes the LR-WPAN connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 wireless network subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3659` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-lowlatency - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-lowlatency - 4.15.0-144.148\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-aws - 4.15.0-1103.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1049-aws - 5.4.0-1049.51~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-azure - 5.4.0-1048.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-dell300x - 4.15.0-1022.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1100-gcp - 4.15.0-1100.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-gcp - 5.4.0-1044.47~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-gke - 5.4.0-1044.46~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1016-gkeop - 5.4.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-74-generic - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-74-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-74-lowlatency - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-74-generic - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-74-lowlatency - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1092-kvm - 4.15.0-1092.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1072-oracle - 4.15.0-1072.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-oracle - 5.4.0-1046.50~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1036-raspi - 5.4.0-1036.39~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1086-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1086.91\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-4.15.0-144-lowlatency - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-generic - 4.15.0-144.148\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-144-lowlatency - 4.15.0-144.148\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-aws - 4.15.0-1103.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1049-aws - 5.4.0-1049.51~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1048-azure - 5.4.0-1048.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1022-dell300x - 4.15.0-1022.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1100-gcp - 4.15.0-1100.113\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-gcp - 5.4.0-1044.47~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1044-gke - 5.4.0-1044.46~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1016-gkeop - 5.4.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-74-generic - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-74-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-74-lowlatency - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-74-generic - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-74-lowlatency - 5.4.0-74.83~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1072-oracle - 4.15.0-1072.80\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-oracle - 5.4.0-1046.50~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1103.112\nNo subscription required",
