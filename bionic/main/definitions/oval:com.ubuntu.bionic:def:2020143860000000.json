    "Title": "CVE-2020-14386 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. Or Cohen discovered that the AF_PACKET implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-14386` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-117-generic - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-4.15.0-117-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-4.15.0-117-lowlatency - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-117-generic - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-117-lowlatency - 4.15.0-117.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1082-aws - 4.15.0-1082.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1035-aws - 5.3.0-1035.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-aws - 5.4.0-1024.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1095-azure - 4.15.0-1095.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-azure - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-gcp - 4.15.0-1083.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-gcp - 5.4.0-1024.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1069-gke - 4.15.0-1069.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1047-gke - 5.0.0-1047.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1036-gke - 5.3.0-1036.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-67-generic - 5.3.0-67.61\nlinux-image-5.3.0-67-lowlatency - 5.3.0-67.61\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-67-generic - 5.3.0-67.61\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-67-lowlatency - 5.3.0-67.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-47-generic - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-47-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-47-lowlatency - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-47-generic - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-47-lowlatency - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1074-kvm - 4.15.0-1074.75\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-oem - 4.15.0-1096.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1068-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1068.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1053-oracle - 4.15.0-1053.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-oracle - 5.4.0-1024.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-raspi - 5.4.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1070-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1070.74\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1033-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-117-generic - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-4.15.0-117-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-4.15.0-117-lowlatency - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-117-generic - 4.15.0-117.118\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-117-lowlatency - 4.15.0-117.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1082-aws - 4.15.0-1082.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1024-aws - 5.4.0-1024.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1095-azure - 4.15.0-1095.105\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-azure - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1083-gcp - 4.15.0-1083.94\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-gcp - 5.4.0-1024.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1069-gke - 4.15.0-1069.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1047-gke - 5.0.0-1047.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1036-gke - 5.3.0-1036.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-67-generic - 5.3.0-67.61\nlinux-image-5.3.0-67-lowlatency - 5.3.0-67.61\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-67-generic - 5.3.0-67.61\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-67-lowlatency - 5.3.0-67.61\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-47-generic - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-47-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-47-lowlatency - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-47-generic - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-47-lowlatency - 5.4.0-47.51~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-oem - 4.15.0-1096.106\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1068-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1068.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1053-oracle - 4.15.0-1053.57\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1024-oracle - 5.4.0-1024.24~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1086-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1086.94\nNo subscription required",
