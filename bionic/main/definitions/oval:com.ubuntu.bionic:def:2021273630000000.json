		"title": "CVE-2021-27363 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernelpointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transportstructure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem,the transport's handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfsfile system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. Whenread, the show_transport_handle function (indrivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle.This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in thekernel module's global variables.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-27363` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-generic - 5.3.0-72.68\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-72-lowlatency - 5.3.0-72.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1015-dell300x - 4.15.0-1015.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1041-gke - 5.3.0-1041.44\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1039-gke - 5.4.0-1039.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1012-gkeop - 5.4.0-1012.13~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1081-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1081.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1038-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1038.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1098-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1098.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
