		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_writeAccording to a syzbot report, end_buffer_async_write(), which handles thecompletion of block device writes, may detect abnormal condition of thebuffer async_write flag and cause a BUG_ON failure when using nilfs2.Nilfs2 itself does not use end_buffer_async_write().  But, the async_writeflag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 (\"nilfs2: fix issuewith race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks\") asa means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks innilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and theresulting crash.This modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-treenode blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it wasirrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summaryand super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.  Thisled to the possibility that the BUG_ON check in end_buffer_async_writewould fail as described above, if independent writebacks of the backingdevice occurred in parallel.The use of async_write for segment summary buffers has already beenremoved in a previous change.Fix this issue by removing the manipulation of the async_write flag forthe remaining super root block buffer.",
