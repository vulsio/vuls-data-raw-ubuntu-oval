		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak during rehashThe rehash delayed work migrates filters from one region to another.This is done by iterating over all chunks (all the filters with the samepriority) in the region and in each chunk iterating over all thefilters.If the migration fails, the code tries to migrate the filters back tothe old region. However, the rollback itself can also fail in which caseanother migration will be erroneously performed. Besides the fact thatthis ping pong is not a very good idea, it also creates a problem.Each virtual chunk references two chunks: The currently used one('vchunk->chunk') and a backup ('vchunk->chunk2'). During migration thefirst holds the chunk we want to migrate filters to and the second holdsthe chunk we are migrating filters from.The code currently assumes - but does not verify - that the backup chunkdoes not exist (NULL) if the currently used chunk does not reference thetarget region. This assumption breaks when we are trying to rollback arollback, resulting in the backup chunk being overwritten and leaked[1].Fix by not rolling back a failed rollback and add a warning to avoidfuture cases.[1]WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1063 at lib/parman.c:291 parman_destroy+0x17/0x20Modules linked in:CPU: 5 PID: 1063 Comm: kworker/5:11 Tainted: G        W6.9.0-rc2-custom-00784-gc6a05c468a0b #14Hardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
