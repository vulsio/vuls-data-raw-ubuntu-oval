		"title": "CVE-2023-4622 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high",
		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af_unix component canbe exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Theunix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in thepeer's recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race whereunix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is beingreleased by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free. We recommendupgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4622` to fix the vulnerability.
