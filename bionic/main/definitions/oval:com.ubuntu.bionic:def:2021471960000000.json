		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/core: Set send and receive CQ before forwarding to the driver Presetboth receive and send CQ pointers prior to call to the drivers andoverwrite it later again till the mlx4 is going to be changed do notoverwrite ibqp properties. This change is needed for mlx5, because in caseof QP creation failure, it will go to the path of QP destroy which relieson proper CQ pointers.
