At thesame time, the workqueue will do the flush_to_ldisc to pop data in a loopuntil there is no more data left. When the sender and workqueue running indifferent core, the sender sends data fastly in full time which will resultin workqueue doing work in loop for a long time and occuring softlockup inflush_to_ldisc with kernel configured without preempt. So I addneed_resched check and cond_resched in the flush_to_ldisc loop to avoid it.",
