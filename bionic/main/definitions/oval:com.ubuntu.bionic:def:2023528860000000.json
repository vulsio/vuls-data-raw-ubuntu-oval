		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:USB: core: Fix race by not overwriting udev->descriptor in hub_port_init()Syzbot reported an out-of-bounds read in sysfs.c:read_descriptors():BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in read_descriptors+0x263/0x280drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:883Read of size 8 at addr ffff88801e78b8c8 by task udevd/5011CPU: 0 PID: 5011 Comm: udevd Not tainted6.4.0-rc6-syzkaller-00195-g40f71e7cd3c6 #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 05/27/2023Call Trace: <TASK> __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:88 [inline] dump_stack_lvl+0xd9/0x150 lib/dump_stack.c:106 print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x3c0 mm/kasan/report.c:351 print_report mm/kasan/report.c:462 [inline] kasan_report+0x11c/0x130 mm/kasan/report.c:572 read_descriptors+0x263/0x280 drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:883...Allocated by task 758:... __do_kmalloc_node mm/slab_common.c:966 [inline] __kmalloc+0x5e/0x190 mm/slab_common.c:979 kmalloc include/linux/slab.h:563 [inline] kzalloc include/linux/slab.h:680 [inline] usb_get_configuration+0x1f7/0x5170 drivers/usb/core/config.c:887 usb_enumerate_device drivers/usb/core/hub.c:2407 [inline] usb_new_device+0x12b0/0x19d0 drivers/usb/core/hub.c:2545As analyzed by Khazhy Kumykov, the cause of this bug is a race betweenread_descriptors() and hub_port_init(): The first routine uses a fieldin udev->descriptor, not expecting it to change, while the secondoverwrites it.Prior to commit 45bf39f8df7f (\"USB: core: Don't hold device lock whilereading the \"descriptors\" sysfs file\") this race couldn't occur,because the routines were mutually exclusive thanks to the devicelocking.  Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it tothe race.The best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changingudev->descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.Drivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;we should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change shouldhave been made long ago.So now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying abuffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev hasnot yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and thenhub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)This eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.The changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they reallyare, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoidwriting to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has beeninitialized.  Similar changes should be made to the code that readsthe BOS descriptor, but that can be handled in a separate patch lateron.  This patch is sufficient to fix the bug found by syzbot.",
