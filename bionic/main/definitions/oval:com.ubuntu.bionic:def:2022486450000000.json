		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:enetc: deny offload of tc-based TSN features on VF interfaces TSN featureson the ENETC (taprio, cbs, gate, police) are configured through a mix ofcommand BD ring messages and port registers: enetc_port_rd(),enetc_port_wr(). Port registers are a region of the ENETC memory map whichare only accessible from the PCIe Physical Function. They are notaccessible from the Virtual Functions. Moreover, attempting to access theseregisters crashes the kernel: $ echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\\:00\\:00.0/sriov_numvfs pci 0000:00:01.0:[1957:ef00] type 00 class 0x020001 fsl_enetc_vf 0000:00:01.0: Adding toiommu group 15 fsl_enetc_vf 0000:00:01.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)fsl_enetc_vf 0000:00:01.0 eno0vf0: renamed from eth0 $ tc qdisc replace deveno0vf0 root taprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \\ queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@31@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 base-time 0 \\ sched-entry S 0x7f 900000 sched-entry S 0x80100000 flags 0x2 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual addressffff800009551a08 Internal error: Oops: 96000007 [#1] PREEMPT SMP pc :enetc_setup_tc_taprio+0x170/0x47c lr : enetc_setup_tc_taprio+0x16c/0x47cCall trace: enetc_setup_tc_taprio+0x170/0x47c enetc_setup_tc+0x38/0x2dctaprio_change+0x43c/0x970 taprio_init+0x188/0x1e0 qdisc_create+0x114/0x470tc_modify_qdisc+0x1fc/0x6c0 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x12c/0x390 Splitenetc_setup_tc() into separate functions for the PF and for the VF drivers.Also remove enetc_qos.o from being included into enetc-vf.ko, since itserves absolutely no purpose there.",
