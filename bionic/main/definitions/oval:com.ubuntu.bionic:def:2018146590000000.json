		"Title": "CVE-2018-14659 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "The Gluster file system through versions 4.1.4 and 3.1.2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via use of the 'GF_XATTR_IOSTATS_DUMP_KEY' xattr. A remote, authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a Gluster volume and repeatedly calling 'setxattr(2)' to trigger a state dump and create an arbitrary number of files in the server's runtime directory. It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled certain files. A remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to create arbitrary files.",
