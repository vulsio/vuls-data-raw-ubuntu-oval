Then, in thefollowing call graph: ip_do_fragment() ip_skb_dst_mtu()ip_dst_mtu_maybe_forward() ip_mtu_locked() the pointer to struct dst_entryis used as pointer to struct rtable: this turns the access to structmembers like rt_mtu_locked into an OOB read in the stack. Fix this changingthe temporary variable used for IPv4 packets in sch_fragment(), similarlyto what is done for IPv6 few lines below.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46954` to fix the vulnerability.
