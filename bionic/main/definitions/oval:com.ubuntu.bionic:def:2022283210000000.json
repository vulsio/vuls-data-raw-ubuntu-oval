		"Title": "CVE-2022-28321 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - negligible.",
		"Description": "The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows authentication bypass for SSH logins. The pam_access.so module doesn't correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue is largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not affect Linux-PAM upstream.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-28321` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibpam-cracklib - 1.1.8-3.6ubuntu2.18.04.4\nlibpam-modules - 1.1.8-3.6ubuntu2.18.04.4\nlibpam-modules-bin - 1.1.8-3.6ubuntu2.18.04.4\nlibpam-runtime - 1.1.8-3.6ubuntu2.18.04.4\nlibpam0g - 1.1.8-3.6ubuntu2.18.04.4\nNo subscription required",
