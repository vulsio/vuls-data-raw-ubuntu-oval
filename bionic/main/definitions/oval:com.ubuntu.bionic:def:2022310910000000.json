		"description": "Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` and `Cookie` headerson requests are sensitive information. In affected versions on making arequest which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different port, ifwe choose to follow it, we should remove the `Authorization` and `Cookie`headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we would onlyconsider a change in host or scheme. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgradeto Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlierseries of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that apartial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host wouldtrigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however thisearlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. Analternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, ratherthan ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expectredirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.",
