		"title": "CVE-2021-47063 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm:bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach If we don't calldrm_connector_cleanup() manually in panel_bridge_detach(), the connectorwill be cleaned up with the other DRM objects in the call todrm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our drm_connector isdevm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup() will be called, ourconnector will be long gone. Therefore, the connector must be cleaned upwhen the bridge is detached to avoid use-after-free conditions. v2: Cleanupconnector only if it was created v3: Add FIXME v4: (Use connector->dev)directly in if() block\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47063` to fix the vulnerability.
