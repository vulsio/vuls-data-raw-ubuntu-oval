    "Title": "CVE-2023-1073 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1073` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1154-aws - 4.15.0-1154.167\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-aws - 5.4.0-1100.108~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1163-azure - 4.15.0-1163.178\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-azure - 5.4.0-1106.112~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1063-dell300x - 4.15.0-1063.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1148-gcp - 4.15.0-1148.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-gcp - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-ibm - 5.4.0-1047.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1138-kvm - 4.15.0-1138.143\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1117-oracle - 4.15.0-1117.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-oracle - 5.4.0-1099.108~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1083-raspi - 5.4.0-1083.94~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1130-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1130.138\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-generic - 4.15.0-209.220\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-209-lowlatency - 4.15.0-209.220\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1154-aws - 4.15.0-1154.167\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1100-aws - 5.4.0-1100.108~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1163-azure - 4.15.0-1163.178\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1106-azure - 5.4.0-1106.112~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1063-dell300x - 4.15.0-1063.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1148-gcp - 4.15.0-1148.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-gcp - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-generic - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-147-lowlatency - 5.4.0-147.164~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1047-ibm - 5.4.0-1047.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1117-oracle - 4.15.0-1117.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1099-oracle - 5.4.0-1099.108~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1148-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1148.158\nNo subscription required",
