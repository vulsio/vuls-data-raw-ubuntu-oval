		"description": "telnetd in GNU Inetutils through 2.3, MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3, andderivative works has a NULL pointer dereference via 0xff 0xf7 or 0xff 0xf8.In a typical installation, the telnetd application would crash but thetelnet service would remain available through inetd. However, if thetelnetd application has many crashes within a short time interval, thetelnet service would become unavailable after inetd logs a \"telnet/tcpserver failing (looping), service terminated\" error. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl isnot supported upstream but is shipped by a few Linux distributions. Theaffected code was removed from the supported MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5)product many years ago, at version 1.8.",
