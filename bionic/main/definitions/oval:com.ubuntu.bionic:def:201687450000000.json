		"title": "CVE-2016-8745 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTPconnector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in the currentProcessor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This inturn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests.Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requestsincluding, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bugwas first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of theConnector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug wasobserved. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introducedthe bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in allcurrently supported Tomcat versions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-8745` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibservlet3.1-java - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\nlibtomcat8-embed-java - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\nlibtomcat8-java - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\ntomcat8 - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\ntomcat8-admin - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\ntomcat8-common - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\ntomcat8-examples - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\ntomcat8-user - 8.0.38-2ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
