But inthe second if statement, we're not checking if 'replay' is NULL againbefore calling replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt().if (replay == NULL && force_static)    return false;...if (link->replay_settings.replay_feature_enabled &&    replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt) {\treplay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt(replay, *power_opts, panel_inst);\tlink->replay_settings.replay_power_opt_active = *power_opts;}If 'replay' is NULL, this will cause a null pointer dereference.Fixes the below found by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/link/protocols/link_edp_panel_control.c:895edp_set_replay_allow_active() error: we previously assumed 'replay' couldbe null (see line 887)",
