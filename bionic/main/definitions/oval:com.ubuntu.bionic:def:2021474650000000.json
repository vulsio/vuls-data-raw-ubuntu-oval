		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle_kvm_start_guest()In commit 10d91611f426 (\"powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code inC\") kvm_start_guest() became idle_kvm_start_guest(). The old codeallocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use theframe to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller'sframe.idle_kvm_start_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal Cfunction, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into itscallers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no callerframe on the emergency stack.The emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:  paca_ptrs[i]->emergency_sp = alloc_stack(limit, i) + THREAD_SIZE;So emergency_sp actually points to the first address above the emergencystack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it withoutfirst decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to theregular kernel stack, paca->kstack, which is initialised to point at aninitial frame that is ready to use.idle_kvm_start_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of whichwrite outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates astack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately theframe it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and sothe saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside theemergency stack allocation.The end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248bytes above the emergency stack allocation.In practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately abovethe emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,either another CPUs mc_emergency_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order ofcalls to irqstack_early_init() and emergency_stack_init().The low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so areonly used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentiallynever happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'dcrash due to that stack overflowing.Still, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purelyluck that we aren't corrupting something else.To fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 onentry, we then create a SWITCH_FRAME_SIZE frame (which has space forpt_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to theexisting stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on theemergency stack.",
