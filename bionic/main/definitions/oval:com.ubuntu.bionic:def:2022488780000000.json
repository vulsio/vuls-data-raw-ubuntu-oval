		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix driver shutdown on closed serdevThe driver shutdown callback (which sends EDL_SOC_RESET to the deviceover serdev) should not be invoked when HCI device is not open (e.g. ifhci_dev_open_sync() failed), because the serdev and its TTY are not openeither.  Also skip this step if device is powered off(qca_power_shutdown()).The shutdown callback causes use-after-free during system reboot withQualcomm Atheros Bluetooth:  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address  0072662f67726fd7  ...
