		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload When a qdisc is deleted froma net device the stack instructs the underlying driver to remove its flowoffload callback from the associated filter block using the'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack then continues to replay the removalof the filters in the block for this driver by iterating over the chains inthe block and invoking the 'reoffload' operation of the classifier beingused. In turn, the classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares andemits a 'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter. However, the stack doesnot do the same for chain templates and the underlying driver neverreceives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when a qdisc is deleted. Thisresults in a memory leak [1] which can be reproduced using [2]. Fix byintroducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack invoke it withthe appropriate arguments as part of the replay. Implement the operation inthe sole classifier that supports chain templates (flower) by emitting the'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}' command based on whether a flow offloadcallback is being bound to a filter block or being unbound from one. As faras I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which reorderedtcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains() in__tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block isexpected to be freed after flushing all the chains.
