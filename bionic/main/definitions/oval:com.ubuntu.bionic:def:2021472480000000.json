		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: udp:fix race between close() and udp_abort() Kaustubh reported and diagnosed apanic in udp_lib_lookup(). The root cause is udp_abort() racing withclose(). Both racing functions acquire the socket lock, butudp{v6}_destroy_sock() release it before performing destructive actions. Wecan't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race, instead usethe SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent udp_abort from doing any action when thecritical race happens. Diagnosed-and-tested-by: Kaustubh Pandey<kapandey@codeaurora.org>\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47248` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
