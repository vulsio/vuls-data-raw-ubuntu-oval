		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: aoe:fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts This patch isagainst CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is: A flaw was found in theATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts()function improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and ause-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the structand the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. This could lead to adenial of service condition or potential code execution. Inaoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial code isfinished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in latertx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the dev_put(ifp) shouldNOT be called in the success path of skb initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts().Otherwise tx() may run into use-after-free because the net_device is freed.This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path inaoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().",
