		"description": "An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and otherproducts. When the Urgent flag is set in a TCP packet, and the stack isconfigured to ignore the urgent data, the stack attempts to use the valueof the Urgent pointer bytes to separate the Urgent data from the normaldata, by calculating the offset at which the normal data should be presentin the global buffer. However, the length of this offset is not checked;therefore, for large values of the Urgent pointer bytes, the data pointercan point to memory that is way beyond the data buffer in uip_process inuip.c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-17437` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\niscsiuio - 2.0.874-5ubuntu2.11+esm1\nopen-iscsi - 2.0.874-5ubuntu2.11+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
