		"title": "CVE-2024-26926 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder:check offset alignment in binder_get_object() Commit 6d98eb95b450 (\"binder:avoid potential data leakage when copying txn\") introduced changes to howbinder objects are copied. In doing so, it unintentionally removed anoffset alignment check done through calls tobinder_alloc_copy_from_buffer() -> check_buffer(). These calls werereplaced in binder_get_object() with copy_from_user(), so now an explicitoffset alignment check is needed here. This avoids later complications whenunwinding the objects gets harder. It is worth noting this check existedprior to commit 7a67a39320df (\"binder: add function to copy binder objectfrom buffer\"), likely removed due to redundancy at the time.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26926` to fix the vulnerability.
