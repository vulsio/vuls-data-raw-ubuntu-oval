Rough callgraph:inetdev_destroy -> ip_mc_destroy_dev -> igmpv3_clear_delrec ->ip_mc_clear_src -> RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->ip_ptr, NULL) However,ip_mc_clear_src() called in igmpv3_clear_delrec() doesn't releasein_dev->mc_list->sources. And RCU_INIT_POINTER() assigns the NULL todev->ip_ptr. As a result, in_dev cannot be obtained throughinetdev_by_index() and then in_dev->mc_list->sources cannot be released byip_mc_del1_src() in the sock_close. Rough call sequence goes like:sock_close -> __sock_release -> inet_release -> ip_mc_drop_socket ->inetdev_by_index -> ip_mc_leave_src -> ip_mc_del_src -> ip_mc_del1_src Sowe still need to call ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() to freein_dev->mc_list->sources.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47238` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
