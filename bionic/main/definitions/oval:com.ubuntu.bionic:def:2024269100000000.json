		"title": "CVE-2024-26910 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation The patch\"netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy and kernel sideadd/del/test\", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition. But thesynchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows it down:it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead. Eric Dumazetpointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as rcu callback doesnot work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors which need cancelling atdestroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy functions are split into two:cancelling garbage collectors safely at executing the command received bynetlink and moving the remaining part only into the rcu callback.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26910` to fix the vulnerability.
