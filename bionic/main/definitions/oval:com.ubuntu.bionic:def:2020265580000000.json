    "Title": "CVE-2020-26558 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time. It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform access control. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26558` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbluetooth - 5.48-0ubuntu3.5\nbluez - 5.48-0ubuntu3.5\nbluez-cups - 5.48-0ubuntu3.5\nbluez-hcidump - 5.48-0ubuntu3.5\nbluez-obexd - 5.48-0ubuntu3.5\nbluez-tests - 5.48-0ubuntu3.5\nlibbluetooth3 - 5.48-0ubuntu3.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1054-aws - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-azure - 5.4.0-1055.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gcp - 5.4.0-1049.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gke - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gkeop - 5.4.0-1021.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1097-kvm - 4.15.0-1097.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-oracle - 5.4.0-1052.56~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1041-raspi - 5.4.0-1041.45~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1092-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1092.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-generic - 4.15.0-151.157\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-151-lowlatency - 4.15.0-151.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-aws - 4.15.0-1109.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1054-aws - 5.4.0-1054.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1055-azure - 5.4.0-1055.57~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1106-gcp - 4.15.0-1106.120\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gcp - 5.4.0-1049.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1049-gke - 5.4.0-1049.52~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gkeop - 5.4.0-1021.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-generic - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-80-lowlatency - 5.4.0-80.90~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1078-oracle - 4.15.0-1078.86\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1052-oracle - 5.4.0-1052.56~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required",
