		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:ngene: Fix out-of-bounds bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() Fix an11-year old bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() while addressing thefollowing warnings caught with -Warray-bounds:arch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:22:16: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset[12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referencedsubobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset[12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referencedsubobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]The problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes of datainto a one-byte size member _config_ of the wrong structueFW_CONFIGURE_BUFFERS, in a single call to memcpy(). This causes alegitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the length of&com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config. It seems that the right structure isFW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains 6 more membersapart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name of the functionngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actual intention is toConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers (which takes place in thefunction ngene_command_config_buf(), above). Fix this by enclosing those 6members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS into new struct config, and use&com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config as the destination address, instead of&com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config, when calling memcpy(). This also helpswith the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds and get uscloser to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines on memcpy().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47288` to fix the vulnerability.
