    "Title": "CVE-2022-3621 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component nilfs2. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211920. It was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3621` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-200-generic - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-4.15.0-200-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-4.15.0-200-lowlatency - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-200-generic - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-200-lowlatency - 4.15.0-200.211\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-aws - 4.15.0-1146.158\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-aws - 5.4.0-1092.100~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-dell300x - 4.15.0-1057.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1141-gcp - 4.15.0-1141.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-gcp - 5.4.0-1096.105~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-lowlatency - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-lowlatency - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-ibm - 5.4.0-1040.45~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1132-kvm - 4.15.0-1132.137\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-oracle - 4.15.0-1111.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-oracle - 5.4.0-1090.99~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1077-raspi - 5.4.0-1077.88~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1124-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1124.132\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-200-generic - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-4.15.0-200-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-4.15.0-200-lowlatency - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-200-generic - 4.15.0-200.211\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-200-lowlatency - 4.15.0-200.211\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-aws - 4.15.0-1146.158\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1092-aws - 5.4.0-1092.100~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1098-azure - 5.4.0-1098.104~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1057-dell300x - 4.15.0-1057.62\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1141-gcp - 4.15.0-1141.157\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1096-gcp - 5.4.0-1096.105~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-135-lowlatency - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-generic - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-135-lowlatency - 5.4.0-135.152~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-ibm - 5.4.0-1040.45~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1111-oracle - 4.15.0-1111.122\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1090-oracle - 5.4.0-1090.99~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1142-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1142.152\nNo subscription required",
