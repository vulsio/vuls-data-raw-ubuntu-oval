		"title": "CVE-2021-31829 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.1 performsundesirable speculative loads, leading to disclosure of stack content viaside-channel attacks, aka CID-801c6058d14a. The specific concern is notprotecting the BPF stack area against speculative loads. Also, the BPFstack can contain uninitialized data that might represent sensitiveinformation previously operated on by the kernel.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-31829` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-dell300x - 4.15.0-1027.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1046-gke - 5.4.0-1046.48~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-gkeop - 5.4.0-1018.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1092-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1092.98\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1109-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1109.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
