    "Title": "CVE-2023-3776 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If tcf_change_indev() fails, fw_set_parms() will immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 0323bce598eea038714f941ce2b22541c46d488f. It was discovered that the network packet classifier with netfilter/firewall marks implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
