		"description": "The NSS code used for checking PKCS#1 v1.5 was leaking information usefulin mounting Bleichenbacher-like attacks. Both the overall correctness ofthe padding as well as the length of the encrypted message was leakingthrough timing side-channel. By sending large number of attacker-selectedciphertexts, the attacker would be able to decrypt a previously interceptedPKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext (for example, to decrypt a TLS session that used RSAkey exchange), or forge a signature using the victim's key. The issue wasfixed by implementing the implicit rejection algorithm, in which the NSSreturns a deterministic random message in case invalid padding is detected,as proposed in the Marvin Attack paper. This vulnerability affects NSS <3.61.",
