		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-freeIn dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freedin several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULLafter dvbdev's deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places,for example, in the following call chain:budget_register  |-> dvb_dmxdev_init        |-> dvb_register_device  |-> dvb_dmxdev_release        |-> dvb_unregister_device              |-> dvb_remove_device                    |-> dvb_device_put                          |-> kref_putWhen calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev indvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed indvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred tokref_put and triggering a use-after-free.",
