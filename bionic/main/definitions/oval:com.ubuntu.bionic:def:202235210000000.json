		"Title": "CVE-2022-3521 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function kcm_tx_work of the file net/kcm/kcmsock.c of the component kcm. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211018 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection Multiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing sockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3521` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1136-kvm - 4.15.0-1136.141\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1081-raspi - 5.4.0-1081.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1128-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1128.136\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-generic - 4.15.0-206.217\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-206-lowlatency - 4.15.0-206.217\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1151-aws - 4.15.0-1151.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1097-aws - 5.4.0-1097.105~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-azure - 5.4.0-1104.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1061-dell300x - 4.15.0-1061.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-gcp - 4.15.0-1146.162\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1101-gcp - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-generic - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-144-lowlatency - 5.4.0-144.161~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1045-ibm - 5.4.0-1045.50~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-oracle - 4.15.0-1115.126\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1094-oracle - 5.4.0-1094.103~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1146-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1146.156\nNo subscription required",
