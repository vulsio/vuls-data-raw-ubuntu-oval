		"description": "In DCE/RPC it is possible to share the handles (cookies for resource state)between multiple connections via a mechanism called 'association groups'.These handles can reference connections to our sam.ldb database. Howeverwhile the database was correctly shared, the user credentials state wasonly pointed at, and when one connection within that association groupended, the database would be left pointing at an invalid 'structsession_info'. The most likely outcome here is a crash, but it is possiblethat the use-after-free could instead allow different user state to bepointed at and this might allow more privileged access.",
