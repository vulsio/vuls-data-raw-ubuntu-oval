		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: NFSD:Fix READDIR buffer overflow If a client sends a READDIR count argument thatis too small (say, zero), then the buffer size calculation in the newinit_dirlist helper functions results in an underflow, allowing the XDRstream functions to write beyond the actual buffer. This calculation hasalways been suspect. NFSD has never sanity- checked the READDIR countargument, but the old entry encoders managed the problem correctly. Withthe commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing the underflow to thepointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space(). Modern NFS clients attempt toretrieve as much data as possible for each READDIR request. Also, we haveno unit tests that exercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of@count values. Thus this case was missed during testing.",
