		"title": "CVE-2017-5120 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Inappropriate use of www mismatch redirects in browser navigation in GoogleChrome prior to 61.0.3163.79 for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and 61.0.3163.81for Android, allowed a remote attacker to potentially downgrade HTTPSrequests to HTTP via a crafted HTML page. In other words, Chrome couldtransmit cleartext even though the user had entered an https URL, becauseof a misdesigned workaround for cases where the domain name in a URL almostmatches the domain name in an X.509 server certificate (but differs in theinitial \"www.\" substring).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5120` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nchromium-browser - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-browser-l10n - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-chromedriver - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-codecs-ffmpeg - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nchromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra - 61.0.3163.100-0ubuntu1.1378\nNo subscription required",
