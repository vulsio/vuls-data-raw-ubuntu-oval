		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offlineWith PREEMPT_COUNT=y, when a CPU is offlined and then onlined again, weget:BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0/0x00000000no locks held by swapper/1/0.CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #100Call Trace: dump_stack_lvl+0xac/0x108 __schedule_bug+0xac/0xe0 __schedule+0xcf8/0x10d0 schedule_idle+0x3c/0x70 do_idle+0x2d8/0x4a0 cpu_startup_entry+0x38/0x40 start_secondary+0x2ec/0x3a0 start_secondary_prolog+0x10/0x14This is because powerpc's arch_cpu_idle_dead() decrements the idle task'spreempt count, for reasons explained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 (\"powerpc:Re-enable preemption before cpu_die()\"), specifically \"start_secondary()expects a preempt_count() of 0.\"However, since commit 2c669ef6979c (\"powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idletask's preempt_count during hotplug\") and commit f1a0a376ca0c (\"sched/core:Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled\"), that justification nolonger holds.The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove thevestigial preempt_enable() from the CPU offline path.Tested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.",
