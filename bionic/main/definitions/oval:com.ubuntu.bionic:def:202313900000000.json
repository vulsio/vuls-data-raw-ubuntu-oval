		"description": "A remote denial of service vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™sTIPC kernel module. The while loop in tipc_link_xmit() hits an unknownstate while attempting to parse SKBs, which are not in the queue. Sendingtwo small UDP packets to a system with a UDP bearer results in the CPUutilization for the system to instantly spike to 100%, causing a denial ofservice condition.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1390` to fix the vulnerability.
