		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_coreThe seg6_input() function is responsible for adding the SRH into apacket, delegating the operation to the seg6_input_core(). This functionuses the skb_cow_head() to ensure that there is sufficient headroom inthe sk_buff for accommodating the link-layer header.In the event that the skb_cow_header() function fails, theseg6_input_core() catches the error but it does not release the sk_buff,which will result in a memory leak.This issue was introduced in commit af3b5158b89d (\"ipv6: sr: fix BUG dueto headroom too small after SRH push\") and persists even after commit7a3f5b0de364 (\"netfilter: add netfilter hooks to SRv6 data plane\"),where the entire seg6_input() code was refactored to deal with netfilterhooks.The proposed patch addresses the identified memory leak by requiring theseg6_input_core() function to release the sk_buff in the event thatskb_cow_head() fails.",
