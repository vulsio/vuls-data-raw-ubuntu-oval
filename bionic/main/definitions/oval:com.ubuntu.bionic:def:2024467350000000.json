		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ublk_drv: fix NULL pointer dereference in ublk_ctrl_start_recovery()When two UBLK_CMD_START_USER_RECOVERY commands are submitted, thefirst one sets 'ubq->ubq_daemon' to NULL, and the second one triggersWARN in ublk_queue_reinit() and subsequently a NULL pointer dereferenceissue.Fix it by adding the check in ublk_ctrl_start_recovery() and returnimmediately in case of zero 'ub->nr_queues_ready'.
