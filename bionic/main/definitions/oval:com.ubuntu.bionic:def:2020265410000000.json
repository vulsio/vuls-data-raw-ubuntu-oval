    "Title": "CVE-2020-26541 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel through 5.8.13 does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This affects certs/blacklist.c and certs/system_keyring.c. It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce certain types of entries in the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. An attacker could use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26541` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-aws - 5.4.0-1061.64~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-azure - 5.4.0-1065.68~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-gcp - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gke - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gkeop - 5.4.0-1029.30~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-oracle - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1048-raspi - 5.4.0-1048.53~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1061-aws - 5.4.0-1061.64~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1065-azure - 5.4.0-1065.68~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-gcp - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gke - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gkeop - 5.4.0-1029.30~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-generic - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-92-lowlatency - 5.4.0-92.103~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1059-oracle - 5.4.0-1059.63~18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
