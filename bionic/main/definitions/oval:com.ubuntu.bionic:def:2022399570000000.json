		"description": "The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response bodybypass. A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing anoptional \"charset\" parameter in order to receive the response in an encodedform. Depending on the \"charset\", this response can not be decoded by theweb application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which wouldordinarily be detected, may therefore bypass detection. The legacy CRSversions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supportedversions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.",
