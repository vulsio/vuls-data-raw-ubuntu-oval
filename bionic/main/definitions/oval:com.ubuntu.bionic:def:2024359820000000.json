		"title": "CVE-2024-35982 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:batman-adv: Avoid infinite loop trying to resize local TT If the MTU of oneof an attached interface becomes too small to transmit the localtranslation table then it must be resized to fit inside all fragments (whenenabled) or a single packet. But if the MTU becomes too low to transmiteven the header + the VLAN specific part then the resizing of the local TTwill never succeed. This can for example happen when the usable space is110 bytes and 11 VLANs are on top of batman-adv. In this case, at least 116byte would be needed. There will just be an endless spam of batman_adv:batadv0: Forced to purge local tt entries to fit new maximum fragment MTU(110) in the log but the function will never finish. Problem here is thatthe timeout will be halved all the time and will then stagnate at 0 andtherefore never be able to reduce the table even more. There are otherscenarios possible with a similar result. The number ofBATADV_TT_CLIENT_NOPURGE entries in the local TT can for example be toohigh to fit inside a packet. Such a scenario can therefore happen also withonly a single VLAN + 7 non-purgable addresses - requiring at least 120bytes. While this should be handled proactively when: * interface with toolow MTU is added * VLAN is added * non-purgeable local mac is added * MTUof an attached interface is reduced * fragmentation setting gets disabled(which most likely requires dropping attached interfaces) not all of thesescenarios can be prevented because batman-adv is only consuming eventswithout the the possibility to prevent these actions (non-purgable MACaddress added, MTU of an attached interface is reduced). It is thereforenecessary to also make sure that the code is able to handle also thesituations when there were already incompatible system configuration arepresent.",
