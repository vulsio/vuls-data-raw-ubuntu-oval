		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: hwrng:core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng There is a dead-lock inthe hwrng device read path. This triggers when the user reads from/dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from /dev/hwrng. The resulting pagefault triggers a recursive read which then dead-locks. Fix this by using astack buffer when calling copy_to_user.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52615` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-226-generic - 4.15.0-226.238\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-226-generic - 4.15.0-226.238\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-226-lowlatency - 4.15.0-226.238\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-181-generic - 5.4.0-181.201~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-181-lowlatency - 5.4.0-181.201~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1153-kvm - 4.15.0-1153.158\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1169-aws - 4.15.0-1169.182\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1124-aws - 5.4.0-1124.134~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1178-azure - 4.15.0-1178.193\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1129-azure - 5.4.0-1129.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1163-gcp - 4.15.0-1163.180\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1128-gcp - 5.4.0-1128.137~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-ibm - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1132-oracle - 4.15.0-1132.143\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1123-oracle - 5.4.0-1123.132~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1108-raspi - 5.4.0-1108.120~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
