		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powercap: intel_rapl: Fix a NULL pointer dereferenceA NULL pointer dereference is triggered when probing the MMIO RAPLdriver on platforms with CPU ID not listed in intel_rapl_common CPUmodel list.This is because the intel_rapl_common module still probes on suchplatforms even if 'defaults_msr' is not set after commit 1488ac990ac8(\"powercap: intel_rapl: Allow probing without CPUID match\"). Thus theMMIO RAPL rp->priv->defaults is NULL when registering to RAPL framework.Fix the problem by adding sanity check to ensure rp->priv->rapl_defaultsis always valid.",
