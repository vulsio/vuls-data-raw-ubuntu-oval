		"title": "CVE-2023-52733 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/decompressor: specify __decompress() buf len to avoid overflowHistorically calls to __decompress() didn't specify \"out_len\" parameter onmany architectures including s390, expecting that no writes beyonduncompressed kernel image are performed. This has changed since commit2aa14b1ab2c4 (\"zstd: import usptream v1.5.2\") which includes zstd librarycommit 6a7ede3dfccb (\"Reduce size of dctx by reutilizing dst buffer(#2751)\"). Now zstd decompression code might store literal buffer in theunwritten portion of the destination buffer. Since \"out_len\" is not set, itis considered to be unlimited and hence free to use for optimization needs.On s390 this might corrupt initrd or ipl report which are often placedright after the decompressor buffer. Luckily the size of uncompressedkernel image is already known to the decompressor, so to avoid the problemsimply specify it in the \"out_len\" parameter.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52733` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-149.166~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1103.111~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1108.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1105.114~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1049.54~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1101.110~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1085.96~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
