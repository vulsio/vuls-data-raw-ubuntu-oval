In versions 0.9.7 and prior, 0.10.0 through 0.10.6, and 0.11.0through 0.11.2, there is a vulnerability that leads to possible remote codeexecution in the mailing action mail-whois. Command `mail` from mailutilspackage used in mail actions like `mail-whois` can execute command ifunescaped sequences (`\\n~`) are available in \"foreign\" input (for instancein whois output). To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need toinsert malicious characters into the response sent by the whois server,either via a MITM attack or by taking over a whois server. The issue ispatched in versions 0.10.7 and 0.11.3. As a workaround, one may avoid theusage of action `mail-whois` or patch the vulnerability manually.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32749` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfail2ban - 0.10.2-2ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
