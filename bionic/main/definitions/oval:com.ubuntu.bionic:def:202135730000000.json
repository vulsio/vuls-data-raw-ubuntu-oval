		"Title": "CVE-2021-3573 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct HCIUNBLOCKADDR or other way triggers race condition of the call hci_unregister_dev() together with one of the calls hci_sock_blacklist_add(), hci_sock_blacklist_del(), hci_get_conn_info(), hci_get_auth_info(). A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects the Linux kernel versions prior to 5.13-rc5. It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle HCI device detach events, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3573` to fix the vulnerability.
