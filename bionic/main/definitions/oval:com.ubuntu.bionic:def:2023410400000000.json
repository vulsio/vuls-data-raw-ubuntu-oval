		"description": " GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. Inorder to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git`directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided bythe user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is located outside the`.git` directory. This allows an attacker to make GitPython read any filefrom the system. This vulnerability is present inhttps://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175.That code joins the base directory with a user given string withoutchecking if the final path is located outside the base directory. Thisvulnerability cannot be used to read the contents of files but could intheory be used to trigger a denial of service for the program. This issuehas not yet been addressed.",
