		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/ioremap: Map EFI-reserved memory as encrypted for SEVSome drivers require memory that is marked as EFI boot servicesdata. In order for this memory to not be re-used by the kernelafter ExitBootServices(), efi_mem_reserve() is used to preserve itby inserting a new EFI memory descriptor and marking it with theEFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.Under SEV, memory marked with the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute needs tobe mapped encrypted by Linux, otherwise the kernel might crash at bootlike below:  EFI Variables Facility v0.08 2004-May-17  general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address0x3597688770a868b2: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI  CPU: 13 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 5.12.4-2-default #1 openSUSETumbleweed  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015  RIP: 0010:efi_mokvar_entry_next  [...]  Call Trace:   efi_mokvar_sysfs_init   ? efi_mokvar_table_init   do_one_initcall   ? __kmalloc   kernel_init_freeable   ? rest_init   kernel_init   ret_from_forkExpand the __ioremap_check_other() function to additionally check forthis other type of boot data reserved at runtime and indicate that itshould be mapped encrypted for an SEV guest.
