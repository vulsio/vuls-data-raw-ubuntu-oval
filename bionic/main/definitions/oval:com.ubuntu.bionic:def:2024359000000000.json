		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: reject new basechain after table flag update Whendormant flag is toggled, hooks are disabled in the commit phase byiterating over current chains in table (existing and new). The followingconfiguration allows for an inconsistent state: add table x add chain x y {type filter hook input priority 0; } add table x { flags dormant; } addchain x w { type filter hook input priority 1; } which triggers thefollowing warning when trying to unregister chain w which is alreadyunregistered.
