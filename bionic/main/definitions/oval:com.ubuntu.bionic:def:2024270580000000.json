Fetching therb_tree root node must also be protected by the dqopt->dqio_sem, otherwise,giving the right timing, shmem_release_dquot() will trigger a warningbecause it couldn't find a node in the tree, when the real reason was theroot node changing before the search starts: Thread 1 Thread 2 -shmem_release_dquot() - shmem_{acquire,release}_dquot() - fetch ROOT -Fetch ROOT - acquire dqio_sem - wait dqio_sem - do something, triger a treerebalance - release dqio_sem - acquire dqio_sem - start searching for thenode, but from the wrong location, missing the node, and triggering awarning.",
