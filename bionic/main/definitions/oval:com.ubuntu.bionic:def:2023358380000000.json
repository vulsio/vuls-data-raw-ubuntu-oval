		"description": "The WireGuard client 0.5.3 on Windows insecurely configures the operatingsystem and firewall such that traffic to a local network that usesnon-RFC1918 IP addresses is blocked. This allows an adversary to trick thevictim into blocking IP traffic to selected IP addresses and services evenwhile the VPN is enabled. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com websiteuses this CVE ID to refer more generally to \"LocalNet attack resulting inthe blocking of traffic\" rather than to only WireGuard.",
