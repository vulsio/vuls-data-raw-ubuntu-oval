This could happen when: * new (say invalid) source caps are advertised * the existing source caps are unregistered * tcpm_register_source_caps() returns with an error as   usb_power_delivery_register_capabilities() failsThis causes port->partner_source_caps to hold on to the now freed sourcecaps.Reset port->partner_source_caps value to NULL after unregisteringexisting source caps.",
