		"Title": "CVE-2019-19319 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.2, a setxattr operation, after a mount of a crafted ext4 image, can cause a slab-out-of-bounds write access because of an ext4_xattr_set_entry use-after-free in fs/ext4/xattr.c when a large old_size value is used in a memset call, aka CID-345c0dbf3a30. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle setxattr operations in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19319` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-66-generic - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-4.15.0-66-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-4.15.0-66-lowlatency - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-66-generic - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-66-lowlatency - 4.15.0-66.75\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1052-aws - 4.15.0-1052.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1016-aws - 5.3.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1007-azure - 5.3.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1046-gke - 4.15.0-1046.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1023-gke - 5.0.0-1023.23~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.0.0-32-generic - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.0.0-32-generic-lpae - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.0.0-32-lowlatency - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-32-generic - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-32-lowlatency - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1048-kvm - 4.15.0-1048.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1059-oem - 4.15.0-1059.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1025-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-oracle - 4.15.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1049-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1049.53\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1017-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1017.19~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-66-generic - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-4.15.0-66-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-4.15.0-66-lowlatency - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-66-generic - 4.15.0-66.75\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-66-lowlatency - 4.15.0-66.75\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1052-aws - 4.15.0-1052.54\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1007-azure - 5.3.0-1007.8~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1008-gcp - 5.3.0-1008.9~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1046-gke - 4.15.0-1046.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1023-gke - 5.0.0-1023.23~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-gke - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.0.0-32-generic - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.0.0-32-generic-lpae - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.0.0-32-lowlatency - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-32-generic - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-32-lowlatency - 5.0.0-32.34~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1059-oem - 4.15.0-1059.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1025-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1025.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1027-oracle - 4.15.0-1027.30\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1066-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1066.73\nNo subscription required",
