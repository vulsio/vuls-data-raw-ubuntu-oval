		"Title": "CVE-2021-39636 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In do_ipt_get_ctl and do_ipt_set_ctl of ip_tables.c, there is a possible way to leak kernel information due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure with system execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-120612905References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the network packet filtering implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize information in certain circumstances. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-39636` to fix the vulnerability.
