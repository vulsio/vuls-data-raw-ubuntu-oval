		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i2c: core: Run atomic i2c xfer when !preemptibleSince bae1d3a05a8b, i2c transfers are non-atomic if preemption isdisabled. However, non-atomic i2c transfers require preemption (e.g. inwait_for_completion() while waiting for the DMA).panic() calls preempt_disable_notrace() before callingemergency_restart(). Therefore, if an i2c device is used for therestart, the xfer should be atomic. This avoids warnings like:[   12.667612] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:318rcu_note_context_switch+0x33c/0x6b0[   12.676926] Voluntary context switch within RCU read-side criticalsection!...[   12.742376]  schedule_timeout fromwait_for_completion_timeout+0x90/0x114[   12.749179]  wait_for_completion_timeout fromtegra_i2c_wait_completion+0x40/0x70...[   12.994527]  atomic_notifier_call_chain from machine_restart+0x34/0x58[   13.001050]  machine_restart from panic+0x2a8/0x32cUse !preemptible() instead, which is basically the same check aspre-v5.2.",
