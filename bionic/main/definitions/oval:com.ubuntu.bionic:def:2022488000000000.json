The root of theproblem is that kcompact0 is not rescheduling on a CPU while a task thathas isolated a large number of the pages from the LRU is waiting onkcompact0 to reschedule so the pages can be released.  Whileshrink_inactive_list() only loops once around too_many_isolated, reclaimcan continue without rescheduling if sc->skipped_deactivate == 1 whichcould happen if there was no file LRU and the inactive anon list was notlow.",
