    "Title": "CVE-2019-9514 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both. It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9514` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-core - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-mail - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-names - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-news - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-runner - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-web - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-words - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required\n\npython-twisted-conch - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
