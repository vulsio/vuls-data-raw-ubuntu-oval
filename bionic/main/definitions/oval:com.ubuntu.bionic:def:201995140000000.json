		"title": "CVE-2019-9514 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentiallyleading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams andsends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream ofRST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues theRST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9514` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-core - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-mail - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-names - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-news - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-runner - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-web - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-words - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython3-twisted-bin - 17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\npython-twisted-conch - 1:17.9.0-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
