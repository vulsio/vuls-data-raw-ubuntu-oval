		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3: gadget: Bail from dwc3_gadget_exit() if dwc->gadget is NULL Thereexists a possible scenario in which dwc3_gadget_init() can fail: duringduring host -> peripheral mode switch in dwc3_set_mode(), and a pendinggadget driver fails to bind. Then, if the DRD undergoes another mode switchfrom peripheral->host the resulting dwc3_gadget_exit() will attempt toreference an invalid and dangling dwc->gadget pointer as well as calldma_free_coherent() on unmapped DMA pointers. The exact scenario can bereproduced as follows: - Start DWC3 in peripheral mode - Configure ConfigFSgadget with FunctionFS instance (or use g_ffs) - Run FunctionFS userspaceapplication (open EPs, write descriptors, etc) - Bind gadget driver toDWC3's UDC - Switch DWC3 to host mode => dwc3_gadget_exit() is called.usb_del_gadget() will put the ConfigFS driver instance on thegadget_driver_pending_list - Stop FunctionFS application (closes the epfiles) - Switch DWC3 to peripheral mode => dwc3_gadget_init() fails asusb_add_gadget() calls check_pending_gadget_drivers() and attempts torebind the UDC to the ConfigFS gadget but fails with -19 (-ENODEV) becausethe FFS instance is not in FFS_ACTIVE state (userspace has not re-openedand written the descriptors yet, i.e. desc_ready!=0). - Switch DWC3 back tohost mode => dwc3_gadget_exit() is called again, but this time dwc->gadgetis invalid. Although it can be argued that userspace should takeresponsibility for ensuring that the FunctionFS application be ready priorto allowing the composite driver bind to the UDC, failure to do so shouldnot result in a panic from the kernel driver. Fix this by settingdwc->gadget to NULL in the failure path of dwc3_gadget_init() and add acheck to dwc3_gadget_exit() to bail out unless the gadget pointer is valid.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47272` to fix the vulnerability.
