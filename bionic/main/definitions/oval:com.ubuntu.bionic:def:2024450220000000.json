		"title": "CVE-2024-45022 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/vmalloc: fix page mapping if vm_area_alloc_pages() with high orderfallback to order 0The __vmap_pages_range_noflush() assumes its argument pages** containspages with the same page shift.  However, since commit e9c3cda4d86e (\"mm,vmalloc: fix high order __GFP_NOFAIL allocations\"), if gfp_flags includes__GFP_NOFAIL with high order in vm_area_alloc_pages() and page allocationfailed for high order, the pages** may contain two different page shifts(high order and order-0).  This could lead __vmap_pages_range_noflush() toperform incorrect mappings, potentially resulting in memory corruption.Users might encounter this as follows (vmap_allow_huge = true, 2M is forPMD_SIZE):kvmalloc(2M, __GFP_NOFAIL|GFP_X)    __vmalloc_node_range_noprof(vm_flags=VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP)        vm_area_alloc_pages(order=9) ---> order-9 allocation failed andfallback to order-0            vmap_pages_range()                vmap_pages_range_noflush()                    __vmap_pages_range_noflush(page_shift = 21) ----> wrongmapping happensWe can remove the fallback code because if a high-order allocation fails,__vmalloc_node_range_noprof() will retry with order-0.  Therefore, it isunnecessary to fallback to order-0 here.  Therefore, fix this by removingthe fallback code.",
