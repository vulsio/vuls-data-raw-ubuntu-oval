		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/gma500: Fix BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context errorsgma_crtc_page_flip() was holding the event_lock spinlock while callingcrtc_funcs->mode_set_base() which takes ww_mutex. The only reason to holdevent_lock is to clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event on mode_set_base() errors.Instead unlock it after setting gma_crtc->page_flip_event and on errorsre-take the lock and clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event it it is still set.This fixes the following WARN/stacktrace: [ 512.122953] BUG: sleepingfunction called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:870 [512.123004] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 1253,name: gnome-shell [ 512.123031] preempt_count: 1, expected: 0 [ 512.123048]RCU nest depth: 0, expected: 0 [ 512.123066] INFO: lockdep is turned off.
