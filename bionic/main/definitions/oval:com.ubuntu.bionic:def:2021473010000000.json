		"title": "CVE-2021-47301 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: igb:Fix use-after-free error during reset Cleans the next descriptor to watch(next_to_watch) when cleaning the TX ring. Failure to do so can causeinvalid memory accesses. If igb_poll() runs while the controller is resetthis can lead to the driver try to free a skb that was already freed. (Thecrash is harder to reproduce with the igb driver, but the same potentialproblem exists as the code is identical to igc)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47301` to fix the vulnerability.
