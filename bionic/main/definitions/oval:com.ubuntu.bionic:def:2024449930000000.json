		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/v3d: Fix out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()`When enabling UBSAN on Raspberry Pi 5, we get the following warning:[  387.894977] UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds indrivers/gpu/drm/v3d/v3d_sched.c:320:3[  387.903868] index 7 is out of range for type '__u32 [7]'[  387.909692] CPU: 0 PID: 1207 Comm: kworker/u16:2 Tainted: G        WC     6.10.3-v8-16k-numa #151[  387.919166] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)[  387.925961] Workqueue: v3d_csd drm_sched_run_job_work [gpu_sched][  387.932525] Call trace:[  387.935296]  dump_backtrace+0x170/0x1b8[  387.939403]  show_stack+0x20/0x38[  387.942907]  dump_stack_lvl+0x90/0xd0[  387.946785]  dump_stack+0x18/0x28[  387.950301]  __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds+0x98/0xd0[  387.955383]  v3d_csd_job_run+0x3a8/0x438 [v3d][  387.960707]  drm_sched_run_job_work+0x520/0x6d0 [gpu_sched][  387.966862]  process_one_work+0x62c/0xb48[  387.971296]  worker_thread+0x468/0x5b0[  387.975317]  kthread+0x1c4/0x1e0[  387.978818]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20[  387.983014] ---[ end trace ]---This happens because the UAPI provides only seven configurationregisters and we are reading the eighth position of this u32 array.Therefore, fix the out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()` byaccessing only seven positions on the '__u32 [7]' array. The eighthregister exists indeed on V3D 7.1, but it isn't currently used. Thatbeing so, let's guarantee that it remains unused and add a note that itcould be set in a future patch.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-44993` to fix the vulnerability.
