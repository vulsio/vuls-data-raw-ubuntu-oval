		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:virtio_net: Do not send RSS key if it is not supportedThere is a bug when setting the RSS options in virtio_net that can breakthe whole machine, getting the kernel into an infinite loop.Running the following command in any QEMU virtual machine with virtionetwill reproduce this problem:    # ethtool -X eth0  hfunc toeplitzThis is how the problem happens:1) ethtool_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_set_rxfh()2) virtnet_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_commit_rss_command()3) virtnet_commit_rss_command() populates 4 entries for the rssscatter-gather4) Since the command above does not have a key, then the lastscatter-gatter entry will be zeroed, since rss_key_size == 0.sg_buf_size = vi->rss_key_size;5) This buffer is passed to qemu, but qemu is not happy with a bufferwith zero length, and do the following in virtqueue_map_desc() (QEMUfunction):  if (!sz) {      virtio_error(vdev, \"virtio: zero sized buffers are not allowed\");6) virtio_error() (also QEMU function) set the device as broken    vdev->broken = true;7) Qemu bails out, and do not repond this crazy kernel.8) The kernel is waiting for the response to come back (functionvirtnet_send_command())9) The kernel is waiting doing the following :      while (!virtqueue_get_buf(vi->cvq, &tmp) &&\t     !virtqueue_is_broken(vi->cvq))\t      cpu_relax();10) None of the following functions above is true, thus, the kernelloops here forever. Keeping in mind that virtqueue_is_broken() doesnot look at the qemu `vdev->broken`, so, it never realizes that thevitio is broken at QEMU side.Fix it by not sending RSS commands if the feature is not available inthe device.",
