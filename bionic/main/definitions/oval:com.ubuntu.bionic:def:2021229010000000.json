    "Title": "CVE-2021-22901 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-22901` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.13\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.13\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.13\nlibcurl4 - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.13\nNo subscription required",
