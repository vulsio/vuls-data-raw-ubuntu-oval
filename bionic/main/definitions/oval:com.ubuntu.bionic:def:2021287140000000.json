		"title": "CVE-2021-28714 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memoryT[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explainswhich aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Incoming datapackets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered untilthe guest is ready to process them. There are some measures taken foravoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest:There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stopconsuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but thistimeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on afast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time.(CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest managesto have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next packagewould require more than one free slot, which may be the case when usingGSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28714` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1035-dell300x - 4.15.0-1035.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1066-gke - 5.4.0-1066.69~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-gkeop - 5.4.0-1037.38~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1103-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1103.110\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1120-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1120.129\nNo subscription required",
