		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache There is apotential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation cache hit racingwith an operation that invalidates the cache, such as a DISCARD ITScommand. The root of the problem is that vgic_its_check_cache() does notelevate the refcount on the vgic_irq before dropping the lock thatserializes refcount changes. Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcounton the returned vgic_irq and add the corresponding decrement after queueingthe interrupt.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26598` to fix the vulnerability.
