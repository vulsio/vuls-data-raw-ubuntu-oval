		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slub: actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoningIt turns out that SLUB redzoning (\"slub_debug=Z\") checks froms->object_size rather than from s->inuse (which is normally bumped tomake room for the freelist pointer), so a cache created with an objectsize less than 24 would have the freelist pointer written beyonds->object_size, causing the redzone to be corrupted by the freelistpointer.  This was very visible with \"slub_debug=ZF\":  BUG test (Tainted: G    B            ): Right Redzone overwritten-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  INFO: 0xffff957ead1c05de-0xffff957ead1c05df @offset=1502.
