		"Title": "CVE-2018-17187 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer toperform TLS, enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless averification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modespreviously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate,with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificateverification mode with or without hostname verification being performed.The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache QpidProton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in anexception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted,leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Usesof the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transportTLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-Jutilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enablehostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later andutilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now thedefault for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.",
