		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:fix memory corruption bug with suspend and rebuild The ice driver wouldpreviously panic after suspend. This is caused from the driver *only*calling the ice_vsi_free_q_vectors() function by itself, when it issuspending. Since commit b3e7b3a6ee92 (\"ice: prevent NULL pointer derefduring reload\") the driver has zeroed out num_q_vectors, and only restoredit in ice_vsi_cfg_def(). This further causes the ice_rebuild() function toallocate a zero length buffer, after which num_q_vectors is updated, andthen the new value of num_q_vectors is used to index into the zero lengthbuffer, which corrupts memory. The fix entails making sure all the codereferencing num_q_vectors only does so after it has been reset viaice_vsi_cfg_def(). I didn't perform a full bisect, but I was able to testagainst 6.1.77 kernel and that ice driver works fine for suspend/resumewith no panic, so sometime since then, this problem was introduced. Alsoclean up an un-needed init of a local variable in the function beingmodified.
