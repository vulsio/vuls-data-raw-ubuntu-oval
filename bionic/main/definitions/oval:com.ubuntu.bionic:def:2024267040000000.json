		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: fix double-free of blocks due to wrong extents moved_lenIn ext4_move_extents(), moved_len is only updated when all moves aresuccessfully executed, and only discards orig_inode and donor_inodepreallocations when moved_len is not zero. When the loop fails to exitafter successfully moving some extents, moved_len is not updated andremains at 0, so it does not discard the preallocations.If the moved extents overlap with the preallocated extents, theoverlapped extents are freed twice in ext4_mb_release_inode_pa() andext4_process_freed_data() (as described in commit 94d7c16cbbbd (\"ext4:Fix double-free of blocks with EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT\")), and bb_free isincremented twice. Hence when trim is executed, a zero-division bug istriggered in mb_update_avg_fragment_size() because bb_free is not zeroand bb_fragments is zero.Therefore, update move_len after each extent move to avoid the issue.",
