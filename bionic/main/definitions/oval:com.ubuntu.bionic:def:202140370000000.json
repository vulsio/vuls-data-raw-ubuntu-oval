		"title": "CVE-2021-4037 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() functionlogic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for theXFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group executionand SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID andbelongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member ofthis group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case whenthey should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previousCVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4037` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1033-dell300x - 4.15.0-1033.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1057-gke - 5.4.0-1057.60~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1029-gkeop - 5.4.0-1029.30~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1101-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1101.108\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1118-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1118.127\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
