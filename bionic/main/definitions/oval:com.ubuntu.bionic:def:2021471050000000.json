		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: xsk: return xsk buffers back to pool when cleaning the ringCurrently we only NULL the xdp_buff pointer in the internal SW ring butwe never give it back to the xsk buffer pool. This means that bufferscan be leaked out of the buff pool and never be used again.Add missing xsk_buff_free() call to the routine that is supposed toclean the entries that are left in the ring so that these buffers in theumem can be used by other sockets.Also, only go through the space that is actually left to be cleanedinstead of a whole ring.",
