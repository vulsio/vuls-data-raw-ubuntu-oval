		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ocfs2:fix data corruption by fallocate When fallocate punches holes out of inodesize, if original isize is in the middle of last cluster, then the partfrom isize to the end of the cluster will be zeroed with buffer write, atthat time isize is not yet updated to match the new size, if writeback iskicked in, it will invoke ocfs2_writepage()->block_write_full_page() wherethe pages out of inode size will be dropped. That will cause filecorruption. Fix this by zero out eof blocks when extending the inode size.Running the following command with qemu-image 4.2.1 can get a corruptedcoverted image file easily. qemu-img convert -p -t none -T none -f qcow2$qcow_image \\ -O qcow2 -o compat=1.1 $qcow_image.conv The usage offallocate in qemu is like this, it first punches holes out of inode size,then extend the inode size. fallocate(11,FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE|FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, 2276196352, 65536) = 0fallocate(11, 0, 2276196352, 65536) = 0 v1:https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-fsdevel/msg193999.html v2:https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20210525093034.GB4112@quack2.suse.cz/T/",
