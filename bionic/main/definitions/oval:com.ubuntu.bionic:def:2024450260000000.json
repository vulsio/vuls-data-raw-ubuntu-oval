		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/dasd: fix error recovery leading to data corruption on ESE devicesExtent Space Efficient (ESE) or thin provisioned volumes need to beformatted on demand during usual IO processing.The dasd_ese_needs_format function checks for error codes that signalthe non existence of a proper track format.The check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error casesleading to transport of insufficient data also have this flag set.This might lead to data corruption in certain error cases for exampleduring a storage server warmstart.Fix by removing the check for incorrect length and replacing byexplicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode.Also remove the check for file protected since this is not a validESE handling case.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45026` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required",
