		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix racing between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free and bpf_timer_cancelThe following race is possible between bpf_timer_cancel_and_freeand bpf_timer_cancel. It will lead a UAF on the timer->timer.bpf_timer_cancel();\tspin_lock();\tt = timer->time;\tspin_unlock();\t\t\t\t\tbpf_timer_cancel_and_free();\t\t\t\t\t\tspin_lock();\t\t\t\t\t\tt = timer->timer;\t\t\t\t\t\ttimer->timer = NULL;\t\t\t\t\t\tspin_unlock();\t\t\t\t\t\thrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);\t\t\t\t\t\tkfree(t);\t/* UAF on t */\thrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free, this patch frees the timer->timerafter a rcu grace period. This requires a rcu_head additionto the \"struct bpf_hrtimer\". Another kfree(t) happens in bpf_timer_init,this does not need a kfree_rcu because it is still under thespin_lock and timer->timer has not been visible by others yet.In bpf_timer_cancel, rcu_read_lock() is added because this helpercan be used in a non rcu critical section context (e.g. froma sleepable bpf prog). Other timer->timer usages in helpers.chave been audited, bpf_timer_cancel() is the only place wheretimer->timer is used outside of the spin_lock.Another solution considered is to mark a t->flag in bpf_timer_canceland clear it after hrtimer_cancel() is done.  In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free,it busy waits for the flag to be cleared before kfree(t). This patchgoes with a straight forward solution and frees timer->timer aftera rcu grace period.",
