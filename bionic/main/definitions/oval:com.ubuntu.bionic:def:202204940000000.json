		"Title": "CVE-2022-0494 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
		"Description": "A kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with confidentiality. It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0494` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-dell300x - 4.15.0-1051.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1125-kvm - 4.15.0-1125.130\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1068-raspi - 5.4.0-1068.78~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1117-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1117.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-generic - 4.15.0-191.202\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-191-lowlatency - 4.15.0-191.202\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1139-aws - 4.15.0-1139.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-aws - 5.4.0-1083.90~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-azure - 5.4.0-1089.94~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-dell300x - 4.15.0-1051.56\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1134-gcp - 4.15.0-1134.150\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1086-gcp - 5.4.0-1086.94~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1080-gke - 5.4.0-1080.86~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-gkeop - 5.4.0-1051.54~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-generic - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-124-lowlatency - 5.4.0-124.140~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1031-ibm - 5.4.0-1031.35~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1104-oracle - 4.15.0-1104.115\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1081-oracle - 5.4.0-1081.89~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1135.145\nNo subscription required",
