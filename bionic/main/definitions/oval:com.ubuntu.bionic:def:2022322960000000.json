    "Title": "CVE-2022-32296 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are used. This occurs because of use of Algorithm 4 (\"Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm\") of RFC 6056. Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-32296` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-194-generic - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-4.15.0-194-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-4.15.0-194-lowlatency - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-194-generic - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-194-lowlatency - 4.15.0-194.205\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-aws - 4.15.0-1142.154\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1054-dell300x - 4.15.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-gcp - 4.15.0-1137.153\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1128-kvm - 4.15.0-1128.133\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1107-oracle - 4.15.0-1107.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1070-raspi - 5.4.0-1070.80~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1120-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1120.128\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-194-generic - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-4.15.0-194-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-4.15.0-194-lowlatency - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-194-generic - 4.15.0-194.205\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-194-lowlatency - 4.15.0-194.205\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-aws - 4.15.0-1142.154\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1085-aws - 5.4.0-1085.92~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1091-azure - 5.4.0-1091.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1054-dell300x - 4.15.0-1054.59\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-gcp - 4.15.0-1137.153\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-gcp - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-generic - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-126-lowlatency - 5.4.0-126.142~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1033-ibm - 5.4.0-1033.37~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1107-oracle - 4.15.0-1107.118\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-oracle - 5.4.0-1083.91~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1138-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1138.148\nNo subscription required",
