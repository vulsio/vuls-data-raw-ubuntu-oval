		"title": "CVE-2024-35794 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm-raid: really frozen sync_thread during suspend 1) commit f52f5c71f3d4(\"md: fix stopping sync thread\") remove MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN from__md_stop_writes() and doesn't realize that dm-raid relies on__md_stop_writes() to frozen sync_thread indirectly. Fix this problem byadding MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN in md_stop_writes(), and since stop_sync_thread()is only used for dm-raid in this case, also move stop_sync_thread() tomd_stop_writes(). 2) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that syncthread is frozen, it only prevent new sync_thread to start, and it can'tstop the running sync thread; In order to frozen sync_thread, after setingthe flag, stop_sync_thread() should be used. 3) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZENdoesn't mean that writes are stopped, use it as condition formd_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend() doesn't look correct. Consider thatreentrant stop_sync_thread() do nothing, always call md_stop_writes() inraid_postsuspend(). 4) raid_message can set/clear the flagMD_RECOVERY_FROZEN at anytime, and if MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is cleared whilethe array is suspended, new sync_thread can start unexpected. Fix this bydisallow raid_message() to change sync_thread status during suspend. Notethat after commit f52f5c71f3d4 (\"md: fix stopping sync thread\"), the testshell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang in stop_sync_thread(), andwith previous fixes, the test won't hang there anymore, however, the testwill still fail and complain that ext4 is corrupted. And with this patch,the test won't hang due to stop_sync_thread() or fail due to ext4 iscorrupted anymore. However, there is still a deadlock related to dm-raid456that will be fixed in following patches.",
