		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: block:fix deadlock between bd_link_disk_holder and partition scan 'open_mutex' ofgendisk is used to protect open/close block devices. But inbd_link_disk_holder(), it is used to protect the creation of symlinkbetween holding disk and slave bdev, which introduces some issues. Whenbd_link_disk_holder() is called, the driver is usually in the process ofinitialization/modification and may suspend submitting io. At this time,any io hold 'open_mutex', such as scanning partitions, can cause deadlocks.For example, in raid: T1 T2 bdev_open_by_dev lock open_mutex [1] ...efi_partition ... md_submit_bio md_ioctl mddev_syspend -> suspend all iomd_add_new_disk bind_rdev_to_array bd_link_disk_holder try lock open_mutex[2] md_handle_request -> wait mddev_resume T1 scan partition, T2 add a newdevice to raid. T1 waits for T2 to resume mddev, but T2 waits foropen_mutex held by T1. Deadlock occurs. Fix it by introducing a local mutex'blk_holder_mutex' to replace 'open_mutex'.",
