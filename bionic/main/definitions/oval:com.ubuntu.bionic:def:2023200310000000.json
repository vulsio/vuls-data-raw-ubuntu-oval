		"description": "A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS certificate handling of Snort 3 DetectionEngine integration with Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software couldallow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 detectionengine to restart. This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurswhen an SSL/TLS certificate that is under load is accessed when it isinitiating an SSL connection. Under specific, time-based constraints, anattacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of SSL/TLSconnection requests to be inspected by the Snort 3 detection engine on anaffected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause theSnort 3 detection engine to reload, resulting in either a bypass or adenial of service (DoS) condition, depending on device configuration. TheSnort detection engine will restart automatically. No manual interventionis required.",
