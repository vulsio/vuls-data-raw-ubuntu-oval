		"description": "Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linuxkernels, did not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user()correctly. These could lead to either a double-free situation or memory notbeing freed at all. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service(kernel memory exhaustion) or gain privileges via executing arbitrary code.AKA ZDI-CAN-13562.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3492` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-73-generic - 5.3.0-73.69\nlinux-image-5.3.0-73-lowlatency - 5.3.0-73.69\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-73-generic - 5.3.0-73.69\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-73-lowlatency - 5.3.0-73.69\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1042-gke - 5.3.0-1042.45\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1042-gke - 5.4.0-1042.44~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1014-gkeop - 5.4.0-1014.15~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1039-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1039.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
