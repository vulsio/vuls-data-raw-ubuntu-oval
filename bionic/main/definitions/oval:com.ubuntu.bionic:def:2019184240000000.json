		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gainhost OS privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain hasaccess to a physical device. This occurs because passed through PCI devicesmay corrupt host memory after deassignment. When a PCI device is assignedto an untrusted domain, it is possible for that domain to program thedevice to DMA to an arbitrary address. The IOMMU is used to protect thehost from malicious DMA by making sure that the device addresses can onlytarget memory assigned to the guest. However, when the guest domain is torndown, or the device is deassigned, the device is assigned back to dom0,thus allowing any in-flight DMA to potentially target critical host data.An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into hostmemory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where guests aregiven direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through)are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are notvulnerable.",
