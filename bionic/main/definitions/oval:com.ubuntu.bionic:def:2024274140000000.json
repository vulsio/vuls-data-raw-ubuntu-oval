		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: fix error logic of IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS writing back In the commitd73ef2d69c0d (\"rtnetlink: let rtnl_bridge_setlink checks IFLA_BRIDGE_MODElength\"), an adjustment was made to the old loop logic in the function`rtnl_bridge_setlink` to enable the loop to also check the length of theIFLA_BRIDGE_MODE attribute. However, this adjustment removed the `break`statement and led to an error logic of the flags writing back at the end ofthis function. if (have_flags) memcpy(nla_data(attr), &flags,sizeof(flags)); // attr should point to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS NLA !!! Beforethe mentioned commit, the `attr` is granted to be IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS.However, this is not necessarily true fow now as the updated loop will letthe attr point to the last NLA, even an invalid NLA which could causeoverflow writes. This patch introduces a new variable `br_flag` to save theNLA pointer that points to IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS and uses it to resolve thementioned error logic.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27414` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-186-generic - 5.4.0-186.206~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-186-lowlatency - 5.4.0-186.206~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1126-aws - 5.4.0-1126.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1131-azure - 5.4.0-1131.138~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1130-gcp - 5.4.0-1130.139~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1073-ibm - 5.4.0-1073.78~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1125-oracle - 5.4.0-1125.134~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1110-raspi - 5.4.0-1110.122~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
