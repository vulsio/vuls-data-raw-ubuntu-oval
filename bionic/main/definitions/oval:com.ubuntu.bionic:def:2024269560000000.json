		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappingsPatch series \"nilfs2: fix kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()\".This resolves a kernel BUG reported by syzbot.  Since there are twoflaws involved, I've made each one a separate patch.The first patch alone resolves the syzbot-reported bug, but I thinkboth fixes should be sent to stable, so I've tagged them as such.This patch (of 2):Syzbot has reported a kernel bug in submit_bh_wbc() when writing file datato a nilfs2 file system whose metadata is corrupted.There are two flaws involved in this issue.The first flaw is that when nilfs_get_block() locates a data block usingbtree or direct mapping, if the disk address translation routinenilfs_dat_translate() fails with internal code -ENOENT due to DAT metadatacorruption, it can be passed back to nilfs_get_block().  This causesnilfs_get_block() to misidentify an existing block as non-existent,causing both data block lookup and insertion to fail inconsistently.The second flaw is that nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status inthis inconsistent state.  This causes the caller __block_write_begin_int()or others to request a read even though the buffer is not mapped,resulting in a BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc()failing.This fixes the first issue by changing the return value to code -EINVALwhen a conversion using DAT fails with code -ENOENT, avoiding theconflicting condition that leads to the kernel bug described above.  Here,code -EINVAL indicates that metadata corruption was detected during theblock lookup, which will be properly handled as a file system error andconverted to -EIO when passing through the nilfs2 bmap layer.",
