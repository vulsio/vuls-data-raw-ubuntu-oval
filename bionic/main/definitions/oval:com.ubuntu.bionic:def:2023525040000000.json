It includes KASAN code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on__VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches theKASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_STARTstatic, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue.Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patchingalternatives.[ mingo: updated the changelog ]",
