		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xdp: Remove WARN() from __xdp_reg_mem_model()syzkaller reports a warning in __xdp_reg_mem_model().The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. Itreturns the error in two cases:  1. memory allocation fails;  2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params     struct are not initialized properly.The second case cannot happen since there is a static constrhashtable_paramsstruct with valid fields. So, warning is only triggered when there is aproblem with memory allocation.Thus, there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can besafely removed.WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5065 at net/core/xdp.c:299__xdp_reg_mem_model+0x2d9/0x650 net/core/xdp.c:299CPU: 0 PID: 5065 Comm: syz-executor883 Not tainted6.8.0-syzkaller-05271-gf99c5f563c17 #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOSGoogle 03/27/2024RIP: 0010:__xdp_reg_mem_model+0x2d9/0x650 net/core/xdp.c:299Call Trace: xdp_reg_mem_model+0x22/0x40 net/core/xdp.c:344 xdp_test_run_setup net/bpf/test_run.c:188 [inline] bpf_test_run_xdp_live+0x365/0x1e90 net/bpf/test_run.c:377 bpf_prog_test_run_xdp+0x813/0x11b0 net/bpf/test_run.c:1267 bpf_prog_test_run+0x33a/0x3b0 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:4240 __sys_bpf+0x48d/0x810 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5649 __do_sys_bpf kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5738 [inline] __se_sys_bpf kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5736 [inline] __x64_sys_bpf+0x7c/0x90 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5736 do_syscall_64+0xfb/0x240 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6d/0x75Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42082` to fix the vulnerability.
