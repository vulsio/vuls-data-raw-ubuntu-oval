		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/type1: Unpin zero pagesThere's currently a reference count leak on the zero page.  We incrementthe reference via pin_user_pages_remote(), but the page is later handledas an invalid/reserved page, therefore it's not accounted against theuser and not unpinned by our put_pfn().Introducing special zero page handling in put_pfn() would resolve theleak, but without accounting of the zero page, a single user couldstill create enough mappings to generate a reference count overflow.The zero page is always resident, so for our purposes there's no reasonto keep it pinned.  Therefore, add a loop to walk pages returned frompin_user_pages_remote() and unpin any zero pages.",
