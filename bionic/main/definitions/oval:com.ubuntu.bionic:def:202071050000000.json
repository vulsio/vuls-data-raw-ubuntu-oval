    "Title": "CVE-2020-7105 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "async.c and dict.c in libhiredis.a in hiredis through 0.14.0 allow a NULL pointer dereference because malloc return values are unchecked. It was discovered that Hiredis did not properly catch unsuccessful attempts to allocate memory, resulting in null pointer dereferences. An attacker could potentially use this to cause Hiredis to crash.",
