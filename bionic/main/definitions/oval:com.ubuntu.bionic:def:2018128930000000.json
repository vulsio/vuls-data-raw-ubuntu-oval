		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. One of the fixes in XSA-260added some safety checks to help prevent Xen livelocking with debugexceptions. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, at least one of thesesafety checks can be triggered by a guest. A malicious PV guest can crashXen, leading to a Denial of Service. All Xen systems which have applied theXSA-260 fix are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systemsare not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs tobe able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit thevulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivilegedusers.",
