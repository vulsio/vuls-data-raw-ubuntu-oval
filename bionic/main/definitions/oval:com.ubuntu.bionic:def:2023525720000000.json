After send request to server, wait the response until    mid->mid_state != SUBMITTED;2. Receive response from server, and set it to mid;3. Set the mid state to RECEIVED;4. Kill the process, the mid state already RECEIVED, get 0;5. Handle and release the negotiate response;6. UAF.It can be easily reproduce with add some delay in [3] - [6].Only sync call has the problem since async call's callback isexecuted in cifsd process.Add an extra state to mark the mid state to READY before wakeup thewaitter, then it can get the resp safely.",
