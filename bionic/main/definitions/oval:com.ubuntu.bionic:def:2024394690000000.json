		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errorsThe error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page readfails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if thefolio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falselydetermine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system.In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on afailed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loopwith I/O if i_size of the directory's inode is also corrupted, causing thelog writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot.Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a falsevalue (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39469` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-generic - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-195-lowlatency - 5.4.0-195.215~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-aws - 5.4.0-1132.142~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1137-azure - 5.4.0-1137.144~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1136-gcp - 5.4.0-1136.145~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1079-ibm - 5.4.0-1079.84~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1131-oracle - 5.4.0-1131.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
