		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slub: add check for s->flags in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hookWhen enable CONFIG_MEMCG & CONFIG_KFENCE & CONFIG_KMEMLEAK, the followingwarning always occurs,This is because the following call stack occurred:mem_pool_alloc    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof        slab_alloc_node            kfence_allocOnce the kfence allocation is successful,slab->obj_exts will not be empty,because it has already been assigned a value in kfence_init_pool.Since in the prepare_slab_obj_exts_hook function,we perform a check fors->flags & (SLAB_NO_OBJ_EXT | SLAB_NOLEAKTRACE),the alloc_tag_add functionwill not be called as a result.Therefore,ref->ct remains NULL.However,when we call mem_pool_free,since obj_ext is not empty, iteventually leads to the alloc_tag_sub scenario being invoked.  This iswhere the warning occurs.So we should add corresponding checks in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook.For __GFP_NO_OBJ_EXT case,I didn't see the specific case where it's usingkfence,so I won't add the corresponding check inalloc_tagging_slab_free_hook for now.[    3.734349] ------------[ cut here ]------------[    3.734807] alloc_tag was not set[    3.735129] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 40 at ./include/linux/alloc_tag.h:130kmem_cache_free+0x444/0x574[    3.735866] Modules linked in: autofs4[    3.736211] CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 40 Comm: ksoftirqd/4 Tainted: G        W        6.11.0-rc3-dirty #1[    3.736969] Tainted: [W]=WARN[    3.737258] Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS unknown2/2/2022[    3.737875] pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBSBTYPE=--)[    3.738501] pc : kmem_cache_free+0x444/0x574[    3.738951] lr : kmem_cache_free+0x444/0x574[    3.739361] sp : ffff80008357bb60[    3.739693] x29: ffff80008357bb70 x28: 0000000000000000 x27:0000000000000000[    3.740338] x26: ffff80008207f000 x25: ffff000b2eb2fd60 x24:ffff0000c0005700[    3.740982] x23: ffff8000804229e4 x22: ffff800082080000 x21:ffff800081756000[    3.741630] x20: fffffd7ff8253360 x19: 00000000000000a8 x18:ffffffffffffffff[    3.742274] x17: ffff800ab327f000 x16: ffff800083398000 x15:ffff800081756df0[    3.742919] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 205d344320202020 x12:5b5d373038343337[    3.743560] x11: ffff80008357b650 x10: 000000000000005d x9 :00000000ffffffd0[    3.744231] x8 : 7f7f7f7f7f7f7f7f x7 : ffff80008237bad0 x6 :c0000000ffff7fff[    3.744907] x5 : ffff80008237ba78 x4 : ffff8000820bbad0 x3 :0000000000000001[    3.745580] x2 : 68d66547c09f7800 x1 : 68d66547c09f7800 x0 :0000000000000000[    3.746255] Call trace:[    3.746530]  kmem_cache_free+0x444/0x574[    3.746931]  mem_pool_free+0x44/0xf4[    3.747306]  free_object_rcu+0xc8/0xdc[    3.747693]  rcu_do_batch+0x234/0x8a4[    3.748075]  rcu_core+0x230/0x3e4[    3.748424]  rcu_core_si+0x14/0x1c[    3.748780]  handle_softirqs+0x134/0x378[    3.749189]  run_ksoftirqd+0x70/0x9c[    3.749560]  smpboot_thread_fn+0x148/0x22c[    3.749978]  kthread+0x10c/0x118[    3.750323]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20[    3.750696] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",
