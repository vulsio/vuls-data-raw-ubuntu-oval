		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:target: core: Add TMF to tmr_list handling An abort that is responded to byiSCSI itself is added to tmr_list but does not go to target core. ALUN_RESET that goes through tmr_list takes a refcounter on the abort andwaits for completion. However, the abort will be never complete because itwas not started in target core.
