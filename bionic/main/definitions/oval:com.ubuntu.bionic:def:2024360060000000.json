		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix incorrect list API usage Both the function thatmigrates all the chunks within a region and the function that migrates allthe entries within a chunk call list_first_entry() on the respective listswithout checking that the lists are not empty. This is incorrect usage ofthe API, which leads to the following warning [1]. Fix by returning if thelists are empty as there is nothing to migrate in this case.
