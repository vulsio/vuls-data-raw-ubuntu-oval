		"description": "Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4,2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can becrafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled intowriting files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/`directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the cloneoperation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect thecode that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symboliclink support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --globalcore.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it isbest to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.",
