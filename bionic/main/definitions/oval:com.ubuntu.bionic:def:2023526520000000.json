		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NTB: fix possible name leak in ntb_register_device()If device_register() fails in ntb_register_device(), the device nameallocated by dev_set_name() should be freed. As per the comment indevice_register(), callers should use put_device() to give up thereference in the error path. So fix this by calling put_device() in theerror path so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().As a result of this, put_device() in the error path ofntb_register_device() is removed and the actual error is returned.[mani: reworded commit message]",
