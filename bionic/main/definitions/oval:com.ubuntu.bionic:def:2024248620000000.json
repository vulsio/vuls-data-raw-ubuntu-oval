		"description": "In function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer that maybe caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.Hence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointerdereferencing later in the code. To fix this issue, spi_bus->spi_int[iter]should be checked. The memory allocated by devm_kzalloc will beautomatically released, so just directly return -ENOMEM without worryingabout memory leaks.",
