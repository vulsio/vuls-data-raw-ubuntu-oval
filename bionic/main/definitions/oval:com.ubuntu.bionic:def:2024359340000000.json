		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/smc: reduce rtnl pressure in smc_pnet_create_pnetids_list() Many syzbotreports show extreme rtnl pressure, and many of them hint that smc acquiresrtnl in netns creation for no good reason [1] This patch returns early fromsmc_pnet_net_init() if there is no netdevice yet. I am not even sure whysmc_pnet_create_pnetids_list() even exists, because smc_pnet_netdev_event()is also calling smc_pnet_add_base_pnetid() when handling NETDEV_UP event.[1] extract of typical syzbot reports 2 locks held by syz-executor.3/12252:#0: ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.4/12253: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.1/12257: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.2/12261: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.0/12265: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.3/12268: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.4/12271: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.1/12274: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878 2 locks held by syz-executor.2/12280: #0:ffffffff8f369610 (pernet_ops_rwsem){++++}-{3:3}, at:copy_net_ns+0x4c7/0x7b0 net/core/net_namespace.c:491 #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_create_pnetids_listnet/smc/smc_pnet.c:809 [inline] #1: ffffffff8f375b88(rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: smc_pnet_net_init+0x10a/0x1e0net/smc/smc_pnet.c:878",
