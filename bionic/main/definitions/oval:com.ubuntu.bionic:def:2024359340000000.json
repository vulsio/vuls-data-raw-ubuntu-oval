		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/smc: reduce rtnl pressure in smc_pnet_create_pnetids_list() Many syzbotreports show extreme rtnl pressure, and many of them hint that smc acquiresrtnl in netns creation for no good reason [1] This patch returns early fromsmc_pnet_net_init() if there is no netdevice yet.
