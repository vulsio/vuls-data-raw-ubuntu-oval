    "Title": "CVE-2020-15436 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in fs/block_dev.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service by leveraging improper access to a certain error field. It was discovered that the block layer implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15436` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1080-aws - 4.15.0-1080.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-azure - 4.15.0-1093.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-gcp - 4.15.0-1081.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1067-gke - 4.15.0-1067.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1046-gke - 5.0.0-1046.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1033-gke - 5.3.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1072-kvm - 4.15.0-1072.73\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-oem - 4.15.0-1094.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-oracle - 4.15.0-1051.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1016-raspi - 5.4.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1068-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1068.72\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1032-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1032.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-generic - 4.15.0-115.116\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-115-lowlatency - 4.15.0-115.116\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1080-aws - 4.15.0-1080.84\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1022-aws - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-azure - 4.15.0-1093.103\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1023-azure - 5.4.0-1023.23~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1005-dell300x - 4.15.0-1005.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1081-gcp - 4.15.0-1081.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-gcp - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1067-gke - 4.15.0-1067.70\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1046-gke - 5.0.0-1046.47\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1033-gke - 5.3.0-1033.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1025-gke - 5.4.0-1025.25~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1001-gkeop - 5.4.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-generic - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-45-lowlatency - 5.4.0-45.49~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1094-oem - 4.15.0-1094.104\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1051-oracle - 4.15.0-1051.55\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-oracle - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1084-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1084.92\nNo subscription required",
