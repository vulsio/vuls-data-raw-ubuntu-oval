		"description": "Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language.Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` canhave a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or`$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org forexample where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vectorfor injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or gitvia the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagistdoes not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not beaffected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` witharbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledgethis was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched onpackagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerabilityreport.",
