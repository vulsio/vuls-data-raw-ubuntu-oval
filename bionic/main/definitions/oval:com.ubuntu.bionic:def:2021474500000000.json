		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount The KVM page-table library refcountsthe pages of concatenated stage-2 PGDs individually. However, when runningKVM in protected mode, the host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2as a single high-order compound page, which can cause the refcount of thetail pages to reach 0 when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.Fix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 pageallocator (matching the kernel's split_page() function), and make use of itfrom host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().",
