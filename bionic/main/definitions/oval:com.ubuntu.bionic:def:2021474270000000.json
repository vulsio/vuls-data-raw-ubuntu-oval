		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: iscsi: Fix iscsi_task use after freeCommit d39df158518c (\"scsi: iscsi: Have abort handler get ref to conn\")added iscsi_get_conn()/iscsi_put_conn() calls during abort handling butthen also changed the handling of the case where we detect an alreadycompleted task where we now end up doing a goto to the common put/cleanupcode. This results in a iscsi_task use after free, because the commoncleanup code will do a put on the iscsi_task.This reverts the goto and moves the iscsi_get_conn() to after we've checkedif the iscsi_task is valid.",
