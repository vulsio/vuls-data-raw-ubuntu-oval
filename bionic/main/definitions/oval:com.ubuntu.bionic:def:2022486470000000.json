		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sfc:fix TX channel offset when using legacy interrupts In legacy interrupt modethe tx_channel_offset was hardcoded to 1, but that's not correct ifefx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case, the offset is 0 becausethe tx queues are in the single existing channel at index 0, together withthe rx queue. Without this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, ittries to get the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting theseerrors: WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/tx.c:540efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc] [...] RIP:0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc] [...] Call Trace: <IRQ>dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230 sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360__dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40 [...] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULLpointer dereference at 0000000000000020 [...] RIP:0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc] [...] Call Trace: <IRQ>dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230 sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360__dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40 [...]",
