		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662 formacOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such thattraffic to the local network is sent in plaintext outside the VPN tunneleven if the local network is using a non-RFC1918 IP subnet. This allows anadversary to trick the victim into sending arbitrary IP traffic inplaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.comwebsite uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to \"LocalNet attackresulting in leakage of traffic in plaintext\" rather than to only Clario.",
