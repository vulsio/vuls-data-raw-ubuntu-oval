		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregisteredThe power_supply frame-work is not really designed for there to belong living in kernel references to power_supply devices.Specifically unregistering a power_supply while some other code hasa reference to it triggers a WARN in power_supply_unregister():\tWARN_ON(atomic_dec_return(&psy->use_cnt));Folllowed by the power_supply still getting removed and thebacking data freed anyway, leaving the tusb1210 charger-detect codewith a dangling reference, resulting in a crash the next timetusb1210_get_online() is called.Fix this by only holding the reference in tusb1210_get_online()freeing it at the end of the function. Note this still leavesa theoretical race window, but it avoids the issue when manuallyrmmod-ing the charger chip driver during development.",
