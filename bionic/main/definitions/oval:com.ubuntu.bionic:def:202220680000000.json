		"Title": "CVE-2022-2068 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2068` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.1 - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.19\nopenssl - 1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.10\nopenssl1.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.10\nNo subscription required",
