		"Description": "libspf2 before 1.2.11 has a four-byte heap-based buffer overflow that mightallow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (via an unauthenticatede-mail message from anywhere on the Internet) with a crafted SPF DNSrecord, because of incorrect sprintf usage in SPF_record_expand_data inspf_expand.c. The vulnerable code may be part of the supply chain of asite's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., with additional configuration, Exim canuse libspf2; the Postfix web site links to unofficial patches for use oflibspf2 with Postfix; older versions of spfquery relied on libspf2) butmost often is not.",
