		"description": "To be able to analyze gradle projects, the build scripts need to beexecuted. Apache NetBeans follows this pattern. This causes the code of thebuild script to be invoked at load time of the project. Apache NetBeans upto and including 12.0 did not request consent from the user for theanalysis of the project at load time. This in turn will run potentiallymalicious code, from an external source, without the consent of the user.",
