		"Description": "As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissionsof temporary files it created so that only the current user was allowed toaccess them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file andcreated a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying theeffort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source filesinto the build process.",
