But inline 807 (#2), when the cache is allocated failed, this CPP area structureis not freed, which will result in memory leak. We can fix it by freeingthe CPP area when the cache is allocated failed (#2). 792 intnfp_cpp_area_cache_add(struct nfp_cpp *cpp, size_t size) 793 { 794 structnfp_cpp_area_cache *cache; 795 struct nfp_cpp_area *area; 800 area =nfp_cpp_area_alloc(cpp, NFP_CPP_ID(7, NFP_CPP_ACTION_RW, 0), 801 0, size);// #1: allocates and initializes 802 if (!area) 803 return -ENOMEM; 805cache = kzalloc(sizeof(*cache), GFP_KERNEL); 806 if (!cache) 807 return-ENOMEM; // #2: missing free 817 return 0; 818 }",
