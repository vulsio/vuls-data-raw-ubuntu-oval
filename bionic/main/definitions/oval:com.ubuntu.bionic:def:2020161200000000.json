		"title": "CVE-2020-16120 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "Overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying upfiles in an overlayfs and could be exploited from within a user namespace,if, for example, unprivileged user namespaces were allowed. It was possibleto have a file not readable by an unprivileged user to be copied to amountpoint controlled by the user, like a removable device. This wasintroduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef (\"ovl: stack fileops\"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by commits 56230d9 (\"ovl:verify permissions in ovl_path_open()\"), 48bd024 (\"ovl: switch to mountercreds in readdir\") and 05acefb (\"ovl: check permission to open real file\").Additionally, commits 130fdbc (\"ovl: pass correct flags for opening realdirectory\") and 292f902 (\"ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()\") inkernel 5.8 might also be desired or necessary. These additional commitsintroduced a regression in overlay mounts within user namespaces whichprevented access to files with ownership outside of the user namespace.This regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da (\"ovl: do notfail because of O_NOATIMEi\") in kernel 5.11.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-16120` to fix the vulnerability.
