		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hugetlb, userfaultfd: fix reservation restore on userfaultfd errorCurrently in the is_continue case in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte(), if we bailout using \"goto out_release_unlock;\" in the cases where idx >= size, or!huge_pte_none(), the code will detect that new_pagecache_page == false,and so call restore_reserve_on_error(). In this case I seerestore_reserve_on_error() delete the reservation, and the following callto remove_inode_hugepages() will increment h->resv_hugepages causing a 100%reproducible leak. We should treat the is_continue case similar to adding apage into the pagecache and set new_pagecache_page to true, to indicatethat there is no reservation to restore on the error path, and we need notcall restore_reserve_on_error(). Rename new_pagecache_page topage_in_pagecache to make that clear.",
