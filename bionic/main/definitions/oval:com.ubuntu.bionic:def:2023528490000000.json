This is ultimately due to the region(s), that this memdevis a member, being torn down and expecting to be able to de-reference@cxlds, like here: static int cxl_region_decode_reset(struct cxl_region*cxlr, int count) ... if (cxlds->rcd) goto endpoint_reset; ... Fix it bykeeping the driver context valid until memdev-device unregistration, andsubsequently the entire stack of related dependencies, unwinds.",
