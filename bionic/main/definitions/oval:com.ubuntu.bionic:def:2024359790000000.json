		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:raid1: fix use-after-free for original bio in raid1_write_request()r1_bio->bios[] is used to record new bios that will be issued tounderlying disks, however, in raid1_write_request(), r1_bio->bios[]will set to the original bio temporarily. Meanwhile, if blocked rdevis set, free_r1bio() will be called causing that all r1_bio->bios[]to be freed:raid1_write_request() r1_bio = alloc_r1bio(mddev, bio); -> r1_bio->bios[] is NULL for (i = 0;  i < disks; i++) -> for each rdev in conf  // first rdev is normal  r1_bio->bios[0] = bio; -> set to original bio  // second rdev is blocked  if (test_bit(Blocked, &rdev->flags))   break if (blocked_rdev)  free_r1bio()   put_all_bios()    bio_put(r1_bio->bios[0]) -> original bio is freedTest scripts:mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l1 -n4 /dev/sd[abcd] --assume-cleanfio -filename=/dev/md0 -ioengine=libaio -rw=write -bs=4k -numjobs=1 \\    -iodepth=128 -name=test -direct=1echo blocked > /sys/block/md0/md/rd2/stateTest result:BUG bio-264 (Not tainted): Object already free-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Allocated in mempool_alloc_slab+0x24/0x50 age=1 cpu=1 pid=869 kmem_cache_alloc+0x324/0x480 mempool_alloc_slab+0x24/0x50 mempool_alloc+0x6e/0x220 bio_alloc_bioset+0x1af/0x4d0 blkdev_direct_IO+0x164/0x8a0 blkdev_write_iter+0x309/0x440 aio_write+0x139/0x2f0 io_submit_one+0x5ca/0xb70 __do_sys_io_submit+0x86/0x270 __x64_sys_io_submit+0x22/0x30 do_syscall_64+0xb1/0x210 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6c/0x74Freed in mempool_free_slab+0x1f/0x30 age=1 cpu=1 pid=869 kmem_cache_free+0x28c/0x550 mempool_free_slab+0x1f/0x30 mempool_free+0x40/0x100 bio_free+0x59/0x80 bio_put+0xf0/0x220 free_r1bio+0x74/0xb0 raid1_make_request+0xadf/0x1150 md_handle_request+0xc7/0x3b0 md_submit_bio+0x76/0x130 __submit_bio+0xd8/0x1d0 submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x1eb/0x5c0 submit_bio_noacct+0x169/0xd40 submit_bio+0xee/0x1d0 blkdev_direct_IO+0x322/0x8a0 blkdev_write_iter+0x309/0x440 aio_write+0x139/0x2f0Since that bios for underlying disks are not allocated yet, fix thisproblem by using mempool_free() directly to free the r1_bio.",
