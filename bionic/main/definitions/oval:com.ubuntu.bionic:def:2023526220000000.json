		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:avoid online resizing failures due to oversized flex bg When we onlineresize an ext4 filesystem with a oversized flexbg_size, mkfs.ext4 -F -G67108864 $dev -b 4096 100M mount $dev $dir resize2fs $dev 16G the followingWARN_ON is triggered:================================================================== WARNING:CPU: 0 PID: 427 at mm/page_alloc.c:4402 __alloc_pages+0x411/0x550 Moduleslinked in: sg(E) CPU: 0 PID: 427 Comm: resize2fs Tainted: G E 6.6.0-rc5+#314 RIP: 0010:__alloc_pages+0x411/0x550 Call Trace: <TASK>__kmalloc_large_node+0xa2/0x200 __kmalloc+0x16e/0x290ext4_resize_fs+0x481/0xd80 __ext4_ioctl+0x1616/0x1d90 ext4_ioctl+0x12/0x20__x64_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x150 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90================================================================== This isbecause flexbg_size is too large and the size of the new_group_data arrayto be allocated exceeds MAX_ORDER. Currently, the minimum value ofMAX_ORDER is 8, the minimum value of PAGE_SIZE is 4096, the correspondingmaximum number of groups that can be allocated is: (PAGE_SIZE << MAX_ORDER)/ sizeof(struct ext4_new_group_data) â‰ˆ 21845 And the value that isdown-aligned to the power of 2 is 16384. Therefore, this value is definedas MAX_RESIZE_BG, and the number of groups added each time does not exceedthis value during resizing, and is added multiple times to complete theonline resizing. The difference is that the metadata in a flex_bg may bemore dispersed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52622` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-181-generic - 5.4.0-181.201~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-181-lowlatency - 5.4.0-181.201~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1124-aws - 5.4.0-1124.134~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1129-azure - 5.4.0-1129.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1128-gcp - 5.4.0-1128.137~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1071-ibm - 5.4.0-1071.76~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1123-oracle - 5.4.0-1123.132~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1108-raspi - 5.4.0-1108.120~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
