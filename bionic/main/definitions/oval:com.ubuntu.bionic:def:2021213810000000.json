		"Title": "CVE-2021-21381 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxeddesktop applications on Linux. In Flatpack since version 0.9.4 and beforeversion 1.10.2 has a vulnerability in the \"file forwarding\" feature whichcan be used by an attacker to gain access to files that would notordinarily be allowed by the app's permissions. By putting the specialtokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the Exec field of a Flatpak app's .desktopfile, a malicious app publisher can trick flatpak into behaving as thoughthe user had chosen to open a target file with their Flatpak app, whichautomatically makes that file available to the Flatpak app. This is fixedin version 1.10.2. A minimal solution is the first commit \"`Disallow @@ and@@U usage in desktop files`\". The follow-up commits \"`dir: Reserve thewhole @@ prefix`\" and \"`dir: Refuse to export .desktop files withsuspicious uses of @@ tokens`\" are recommended, but not strictly required.As a workaround, avoid installing Flatpak apps from untrusted sources, orcheck the contents of the exported `.desktop` files in`exports/share/applications/*.desktop` (typically`~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop` and`/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop`) to make sure thatliteral filenames do not follow `@@` or `@@u`.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21381` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nflatpak - 1.0.9-0ubuntu0.3\nflatpak-tests - 1.0.9-0ubuntu0.3\ngir1.2-flatpak-1.0 - 1.0.9-0ubuntu0.3\nlibflatpak0 - 1.0.9-0ubuntu0.3\nNo subscription required",
