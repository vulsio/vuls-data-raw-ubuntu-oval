    "Title": "CVE-2022-24448 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file descriptor. Lyu Tao discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle requests to open a directory on a regular file. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24448` to fix the vulnerability.
