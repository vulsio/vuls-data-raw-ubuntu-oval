		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wireguard: netlink: check for dangling peer via is_dead instead of emptylist If all peers are removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), rather than settingpeer_list to empty, the peer is added to a temporary list with a head onthe stack of wg_peer_remove_all(). If a netlink dump is resumed and thecursored peer is one that has been removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), itwill iterate from that peer and then attempt to dump freed peers. Fix thisby instead checking peer->is_dead, which was explictly created for thispurpose. Also move up the device_update_lock lockdep assertion, sincereading is_dead relies on that. It can be reproduced by a small scriptlike: echo \"Setting config...\" ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard wgsetconf wg0 /big-config ( while true; do echo \"Showing config...\" wgshowconf wg0 > /dev/null done ) & sleep 4 wg setconf wg0 <(printf\"[Peer]\\nPublicKey=$(wg genkey)\\n\") Resulting in: BUG: KASAN:slab-use-after-free in __lock_acquire+0x182a/0x1b20 Read of size 8 at addrffff88811956ec70 by task wg/59 CPU: 2 PID: 59 Comm: wg Not tainted6.8.0-rc2-debug+ #5 Call Trace: <TASK> dump_stack_lvl+0x47/0x70print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x380 print_report+0xab/0x250kasan_report+0xba/0xf0 __lock_acquire+0x182a/0x1b20lock_acquire+0x191/0x4b0 down_read+0x80/0x440 get_peer+0x140/0xcb0wg_get_device_dump+0x471/0x1130\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26951` to fix the vulnerability.
