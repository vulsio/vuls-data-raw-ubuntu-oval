When the flush is needed the code jumpsout-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back to continuethe syscall return.However the branch back to label 1b doesn't return to the correctlocation, instead branching back just prior to the return to userspace,causing bogus register values to be used by the rfi.The breakage was introduced by commit 6f76a01173cc(\"powerpc/syscall: implement system call entry/exit logic in C for PPC32\")whichinadvertently removed the \"1\" label and reused it elsewhere.Fix it by adding named local labels in the correct locations. Note thatthe return label needs to be outside the ifdef so that CONFIG_PPC_47x=ncompiles.",
