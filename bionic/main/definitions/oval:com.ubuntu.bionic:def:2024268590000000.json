		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/bnx2x: Prevent access to a freed page in page_pool Fix race conditionleading to system crash during EEH error handling During EEH errorrecovery, the bnx2x driver's transmit timeout logic could cause a racecondition when handling reset tasks. The bnx2x_tx_timeout() schedules resettasks via bnx2x_sp_rtnl_task(), which ultimately leads tobnx2x_nic_unload(). In bnx2x_nic_unload() SGEs are freed usingbnx2x_free_rx_sge_range(). However, this could overlap with the EEHdriver's attempt to reset the device using bnx2x_io_slot_reset(), whichalso tries to free SGEs. This race condition can result in system crashesdue to accessing freed memory locations in bnx2x_free_rx_sge() 799 staticinline void bnx2x_free_rx_sge(struct bnx2x *bp, 800 struct bnx2x_fastpath*fp, u16 index) 801 { 802 struct sw_rx_page *sw_buf =&fp->rx_page_ring[index]; 803 struct page *page = sw_buf->page; .... wheresw_buf was set to NULL after the call to dma_unmap_page() by the precedingthread.
