		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_mirred: don't override retval if we already lost the skb Ifwe're redirecting the skb, and haven't called tcf_mirred_forward(), yet, weneed to tell the core to drop the skb by setting the retcode to SHOT. If wehave called tcf_mirred_forward(), however, the skb is out of our hands andreturning SHOT will lead to UaF.
