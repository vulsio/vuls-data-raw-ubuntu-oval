		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp: avoid too many retransmit packetsIf a TCP socket is using TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, and the other peerretracted its window to zero, tcp_retransmit_timer() canretransmit a packet every two jiffies (2 ms for HZ=1000),for about 4 minutes after TCP_USER_TIMEOUT has 'expired'.The fix is to make sure tcp_rtx_probe0_timed_out() takesicsk->icsk_user_timeout into account.Before blamed commit, the socket would not timeout aftericsk->icsk_user_timeout, but would use standard exponentialbackoff for the retransmits.Also worth noting that before commit e89688e3e978 (\"net: tcp:fix unexcepted socket die when snd_wnd is 0\"), the issuewould last 2 minutes instead of 4.",
