		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted TMF sas_taskCurrently a use-after-free may occur if a TMF sas_task is aborted before wehandle the IO completion in mpi_ssp_completion(). The abort occurs due totimeout.When the timeout occurs, the SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED flag is set and thesas_task is freed in pm8001_exec_internal_tmf_task().However, if the I/O completion occurs later, the I/O completion stillthinks that the sas_task is available. Fix this by clearing the ccb->taskif the TMF times out - the I/O completion handler does nothing if thispointer is cleared.",
