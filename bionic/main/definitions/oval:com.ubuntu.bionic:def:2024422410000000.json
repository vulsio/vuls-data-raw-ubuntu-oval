		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/shmem: disable PMD-sized page cache if neededFor shmem files, it's possible that PMD-sized page cache can't besupported by xarray.  For example, 512MB page cache on ARM64 when the basepage size is 64KB can't be supported by xarray.  It leads to errors as thefollowing messages indicate when this sort of xarray entry is split.WARNING: CPU: 34 PID: 7578 at lib/xarray.c:1025 xas_split_alloc+0xf8/0x128Modules linked in: binfmt_misc nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6   \\nft_fib nft_reject_inet nf_reject_ipv4 nf_reject_ipv6 nft_reject        \\nft_ct nft_chain_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4  \\ip_set rfkill nf_tables nfnetlink vfat fat virtio_balloon drm fuse xfs  \\libcrc32c crct10dif_ce ghash_ce sha2_ce sha256_arm64 sha1_ce virtio_net \\net_failover virtio_console virtio_blk failover dimlib virtio_mmioCPU: 34 PID: 7578 Comm: test Kdump: loaded Tainted: G W 6.10.0-rc5-gavin+#9Hardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS edk2-20240524-1.el905/24/2024pstate: 83400005 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO +TCO +DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)pc : xas_split_alloc+0xf8/0x128lr : split_huge_page_to_list_to_order+0x1c4/0x720sp : ffff8000882af5f0x29: ffff8000882af5f0 x28: ffff8000882af650 x27: ffff8000882af768x26: 0000000000000cc0 x25: 000000000000000d x24: ffff00010625b858x23: ffff8000882af650 x22: ffffffdfc0900000 x21: 0000000000000000x20: 0000000000000000 x19: ffffffdfc0900000 x18: 0000000000000000x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000018000000000 x15: 52f8004000000000x14: 0000e00000000000 x13: 0000000000002000 x12: 0000000000000020x11: 52f8000000000000 x10: 52f8e1c0ffff6000 x9 : ffffbeb9619a681cx8 : 0000000000000003 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : ffff00010b02ddb0x5 : ffffbeb96395e378 x4 : 0000000000000000 x3 : 0000000000000cc0x2 : 000000000000000d x1 : 000000000000000c x0 : 0000000000000000Call trace: xas_split_alloc+0xf8/0x128 split_huge_page_to_list_to_order+0x1c4/0x720 truncate_inode_partial_folio+0xdc/0x160 shmem_undo_range+0x2bc/0x6a8 shmem_fallocate+0x134/0x430 vfs_fallocate+0x124/0x2e8 ksys_fallocate+0x4c/0xa0 __arm64_sys_fallocate+0x24/0x38 invoke_syscall.constprop.0+0x7c/0xd8 do_el0_svc+0xb4/0xd0 el0_svc+0x44/0x1d8 el0t_64_sync_handler+0x134/0x150 el0t_64_sync+0x17c/0x180Fix it by disabling PMD-sized page cache when HPAGE_PMD_ORDER is largerthan MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER.  As Matthew Wilcox pointed, the page cache in ashmem file isn't represented by a multi-index entry and doesn't have thislimitation when the xarry entry is split until commit 6b24ca4a1a8d (\"mm:Use multi-index entries in the page cache\").\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42241` to fix the vulnerability.
