		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tun:avoid double free in tun_free_netdev Avoid double free in tun_free_netdev()by moving the dev->tstats and tun->security allocs to a new ndo_initroutine (tun_net_init()) that will be called by register_netdevice().ndo_init is paired with the desctructor (tun_free_netdev()), so if there'san error in register_netdevice() the destructor will handle the frees.
