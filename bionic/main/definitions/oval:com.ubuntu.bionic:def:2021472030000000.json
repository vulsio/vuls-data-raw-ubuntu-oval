		"title": "CVE-2021-47203 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq() When parsing the txqlist in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to pass the requests to theadapter. If such an attempt fails, a local \"fail_msg\" string is set and alog message output. The job is then added to a completions list forcancellation. Processing of any further jobs from the txq list continues,but since \"fail_msg\" remains set, jobs are added to the completions listregardless of whether a wqe was passed to the adapter. If successfullyadded to txcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in listcorruption. Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to thecompletions list. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to thecompletions list unless they had an appropriate failure.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47203` to fix the vulnerability.
