		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:hns3: do not allow call hns3_nic_net_open repeatedly hns3_nic_net_open() isnot allowed to called repeatly, but there is no checking for this. Whendoing device reset and setup tc concurrently, there is a small oppotunityto call hns3_nic_net_open repeatedly, and cause kernel bug by callingnapi_enable twice.
