		"Description": "An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt in versions before 3002.8,3003.4, 3004.1. When configured as a Master-of-Masters, with apublisher_acl, if a user configured in the publisher_acl targets any minionconnected to the Syndic, the Salt Master incorrectly interpreted no validtargets as valid, allowing configured users to target any of the minionsconnected to the syndic with their configured commands. This requires asyndic master combined with publisher_acl configured on theMaster-of-Masters, allowing users specified in the publisher_acl to bypasspermissions, publishing authorized commands to any configured minion.",
