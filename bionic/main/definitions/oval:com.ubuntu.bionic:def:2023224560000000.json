		"description": "ViewVC, a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version controlrepositories, as a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects versionsprior to 1.2.2 and 1.1.29. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated bythe need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversionrepository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attackvector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into anHTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), whichthemselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at leastversion 1.2.2 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.29 (ifthey are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, sousers of that release lineage should implement a workaround. Users can edittheir ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed pathsduring rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` filereferences to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format \"html\"]` and`[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.path]`will become `[format \"html\"][changes.path][end]`. (This workaround shouldbe reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else changedpath names will be doubly escaped.)",
