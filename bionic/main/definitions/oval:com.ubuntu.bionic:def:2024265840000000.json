		"title": "CVE-2024-26584 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests Since we're setting theCRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS invalid situations. For example, when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full(easy to trigger with an artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen),requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,the async callback will also be called twice: first with err ==-EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the newtls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS toavoid having to modify all the error handling paths. The handling isidentical.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26584` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-214-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1143-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1159-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
