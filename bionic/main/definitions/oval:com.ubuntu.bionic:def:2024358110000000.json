		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:brcmfmac: Fix use-after-free bug in brcmf_cfg80211_detach This is thecandidate patch of CVE-2023-47233 :https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47233 In brcm80211 driver,itstarts with the following invoking chain to start init a timeout worker:->brcmf_usb_probe ->brcmf_usb_probe_cb ->brcmf_attach ->brcmf_bus_started->brcmf_cfg80211_attach ->wl_init_priv ->brcmf_init_escan->INIT_WORK(&cfg->escan_timeout_work, brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker);If we disconnect the USB by hotplug, it will call brcmf_usb_disconnect tomake cleanup. The invoking chain is : brcmf_usb_disconnect->brcmf_usb_disconnect_cb ->brcmf_detach ->brcmf_cfg80211_detach->kfree(cfg); While the timeout woker may still be running. This will causea use-after-free bug on cfg in brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker. Fix itby deleting the timer and canceling the worker in brcmf_cfg80211_detach.[arend.vanspriel@broadcom.com: keep timer delete as is and cancel work justbefore free]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35811` to fix the vulnerability.
