		"description": "Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.Prior to version 1.2.27, an arbitrary file write vulnerability, exploitablethrough the \"Package Import\" feature, allows authenticated users having the\"Import Templates\" permission to execute arbitrary PHP code on the webserver. The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` functiondefined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The function blindly trusts thefilename and file content provided within the XML data, and writes suchfiles into the Cacti base path (or even outside, since path traversalsequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write or overwritearbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution of arbitrary PHPcode or other security impacts. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for thisissue.",
