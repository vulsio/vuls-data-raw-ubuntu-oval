		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointersCurrently, if an automatically freed allocation is an error pointer thatwill lead to a crash.  An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show().   171\tchar *label __free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i);   172\tif (IS_ERR(label)) {   173\t\tdev_err(wm831x->dev, \"Failed to duplicate label\\n\");   174\t\tcontinue;   175  }The auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well,otherwise we're going to keep hitting issues like this.",
