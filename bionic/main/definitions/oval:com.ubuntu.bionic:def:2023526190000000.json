		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pstore/ram: Fix crash when setting number of cpus to an odd numberWhen the number of cpu cores is adjusted to 7 or other odd numbers,the zone size will become an odd number.The address of the zone will become:    addr of zone0 = BASE    addr of zone1 = BASE + zone_size    addr of zone2 = BASE + zone_size*2    ...The address of zone1/3/5/7 will be mapped to non-alignment va.Eventually crashes will occur when accessing these va.So, use ALIGN_DOWN() to make sure the zone size is evento avoid this bug.",
