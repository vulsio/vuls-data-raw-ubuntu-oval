		"title": "CVE-2021-23336 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low",
		"description": "The package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and before3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before 3.9.2 arevulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl andurllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When theattacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they cancause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy(running with default configuration) and the server. This can result inmalicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy wouldusually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would notinclude it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-23336` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.11\npython-django-common - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.11\npython3-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.11\nNo subscription required",
