This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious programs running under privileges of users belonging to the wheel group to further escalate its privileges by modifying system files without user's knowledge. Successful exploitation requires uncommon system configuration.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3827` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngvfs - 1.36.1-0ubuntu1.3\ngvfs-backends - 1.36.1-0ubuntu1.3\ngvfs-bin - 1.36.1-0ubuntu1.3\ngvfs-common - 1.36.1-0ubuntu1.3\ngvfs-daemons - 1.36.1-0ubuntu1.3\ngvfs-fuse - 1.36.1-0ubuntu1.3\ngvfs-libs - 1.36.1-0ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
