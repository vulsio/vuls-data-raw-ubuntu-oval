		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mptcp: pm: avoid possible UaF when selecting endpselect_local_address() and select_signal_address() both select anendpoint entry from the list inside an RCU protected section, but returna reference to it, to be read later on. If the entry is dereferencedafter the RCU unlock, reading info could cause a Use-after-Free.A simple solution is to copy the required info while inside the RCUprotected section to avoid any risk of UaF later. The address ID mightneed to be modified later to handle the ID0 case later, so a copy seemsOK to deal with.",
