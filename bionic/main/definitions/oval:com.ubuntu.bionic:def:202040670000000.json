		"Description": "In coturn before version 4.5.1.3, there is an issue whereby STUN/TURN response buffer is not initialized properly. There is a leak of information between different client connections.

This has been fixed in 4.5.1.3.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-4067` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncoturn - 4.5.0.7-1ubuntu2.18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
