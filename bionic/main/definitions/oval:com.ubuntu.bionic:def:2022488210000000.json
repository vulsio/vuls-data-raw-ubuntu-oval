		"title": "CVE-2022-48821 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:misc: fastrpc: avoid double fput() on failed usercopyIf the copy back to userland fails for the FASTRPC_IOCTL_ALLOC_DMA_BUFFioctl(), we shouldn't assume that 'buf->dmabuf' is still valid. In fact,dma_buf_fd() called fd_install() before, i.e. \"consumed\" one reference,leaving us with none.Calling dma_buf_put() will therefore put a reference we no longer own,leading to a valid file descritor table entry for an already released'file' object which is a straight use-after-free.Simply avoid calling dma_buf_put() and rely on the process exit code todo the necessary cleanup, if needed, i.e. if the file descriptor isstill valid.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48821` to fix the vulnerability.
