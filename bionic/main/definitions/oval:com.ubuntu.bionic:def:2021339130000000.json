		"Title": "CVE-2021-33913 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "libspf2 before 1.2.11 has a heap-based buffer overflow that might allowremote attackers to execute arbitrary code (via an unauthenticated e-mailmessage from anywhere on the Internet) with a crafted SPF DNS record,because of SPF_record_expand_data in spf_expand.c. The amount of overfloweddata depends on the relationship between the length of an entire domainname and the length of its leftmost label. The vulnerable code may be partof the supply chain of a site's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., withadditional configuration, Exim can use libspf2; the Postfix web site linksto unofficial patches for use of libspf2 with Postfix; older versions ofspfquery relied on libspf2) but most often is not.",
