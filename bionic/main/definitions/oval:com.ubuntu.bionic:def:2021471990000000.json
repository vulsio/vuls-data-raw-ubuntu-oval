		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: CT, Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod acts CT clearaction offload adds additional mod hdr actions to the flow's original modactions in order to clear the registers which hold ct_state. When such flowalso includes encap action, a neigh update event can cause the driver tounoffload the flow and then reoffload it. Each time this happens, the ctclear handling adds that same set of mod hdr actions to reset ct_stateuntil the max of mod hdr actions is reached. Also the driver never releasesthe allocated mod hdr actions and causing a memleak. Fix above two issuesby moving CT clear mod acts allocation into the parsing actions phase andonly use it when offloading the rule. The release of mod acts will be donein the normal flow_put(). backtrace: [<000000007316e2f3>]krealloc+0x83/0xd0 [<00000000ef157de1>] mlx5e_mod_hdr_alloc+0x147/0x300[mlx5_core] [<00000000970ce4ae>]mlx5e_tc_match_to_reg_set_and_get_id+0xd7/0x240 [mlx5_core][<0000000067c5fa17>] mlx5e_tc_match_to_reg_set+0xa/0x20 [mlx5_core][<00000000d032eb98>] mlx5_tc_ct_entry_set_registers.isra.0+0x36/0xc0[mlx5_core] [<00000000fd23b869>] mlx5_tc_ct_flow_offload+0x272/0x1f10[mlx5_core] [<000000004fc24acc>]mlx5e_tc_offload_fdb_rules.part.0+0x150/0x620 [mlx5_core][<00000000dc741c17>] mlx5e_tc_encap_flows_add+0x489/0x690 [mlx5_core][<00000000e92e49d7>] mlx5e_rep_update_flows+0x6e4/0x9b0 [mlx5_core][<00000000f60f5602>] mlx5e_rep_neigh_update+0x39a/0x5d0 [mlx5_core]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47199` to fix the vulnerability.
