		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power faultThe Power Fault Detected bit in the Slot Status register differs fromall other hotplug events in that it is sticky:  It can only be clearedafter turning off slot power.  Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:  If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,  it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].  The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to  the hot-plug slot.The stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops whichwere fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe (\"PCI pciehp: fix power faultinterrupt storm problem\") and 99f0169c17f3 (\"PCI: pciehp: enablesoftware notification on empty slots\").Unfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertentlyreintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 (\"PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interruptrace\"):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit untilpciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQthread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirqhandler is stuck in an infinite loop.  Fix by setting thepower_fault_detected flag already in the hardirq handler.",
