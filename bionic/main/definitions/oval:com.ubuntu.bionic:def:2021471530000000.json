		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i2c: i801: Don't generate an interrupt on bus resetNow that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting the KILL bitin a attempt to recover from a timed out transaction triggers aninterrupt. Unfortunately, the interrupt handler (i801_isr) is notprepared for this situation and will try to process the interrupt asif it was signaling the end of a successful transaction. In the caseof a block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memoryaccess.This condition was reproduced several times by syzbot:https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ed71512d469895b5b34ehttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8c8dedc0ba9e03f6c79ehttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=c8ff0b6d6c73d81b610ehttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=33f6c360821c399d69ebhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=be15dc0b1933f04b043ahttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=b4d3fd1dfd53e90afd79So disable interrupts while trying to reset the bus. Interrupts willbe enabled again for the following transaction.",
