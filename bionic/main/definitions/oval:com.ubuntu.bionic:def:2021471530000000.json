		"title": "CVE-2021-47153 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c:i801: Don't generate an interrupt on bus reset Now that the i2c-i801 driversupports interrupts, setting the KILL bit in a attempt to recover from atimed out transaction triggers an interrupt. Unfortunately, the interrupthandler (i801_isr) is not prepared for this situation and will try toprocess the interrupt as if it was signaling the end of a successfultransaction. In the case of a block transaction, this can result in anout-of-range memory access. This condition was reproduced several times bysyzbot: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ed71512d469895b5b34ehttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8c8dedc0ba9e03f6c79ehttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=c8ff0b6d6c73d81b610ehttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=33f6c360821c399d69ebhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=be15dc0b1933f04b043ahttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=b4d3fd1dfd53e90afd79 So disableinterrupts while trying to reset the bus. Interrupts will be enabled againfor the following transaction.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47153` to fix the vulnerability.
