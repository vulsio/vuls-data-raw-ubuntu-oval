		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vhost: fix hung thread due to erroneous iotlb entriesIn vhost_iotlb_add_range_ctx(), range size can overflow to 0 whenstart is 0 and last is ULONG_MAX. One instance where it can happenis when userspace sends an IOTLB message with iova=size=uaddr=0(vhost_process_iotlb_msg). So, an entry with size = 0, start = 0,last = ULONG_MAX ends up in the iotlb. Next time a packet is sent,iotlb_access_ok() loops indefinitely due to that erroneous entry.\tCall Trace:\t <TASK>\t iotlb_access_ok+0x21b/0x3e0 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:1340\t vq_meta_prefetch+0xbc/0x280 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:1366\t vhost_transport_do_send_pkt+0xe0/0xfd0 drivers/vhost/vsock.c:104\t vhost_worker+0x23d/0x3d0 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:372\t kthread+0x2e9/0x3a0 kernel/kthread.c:377\t ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:295\t </TASK>Reported by syzbot at:\thttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=0abd373e2e50d704db87To fix this, do two things:1. Return -EINVAL in vhost_chr_write_iter() when userspace asks to map   a range with size 0.2. Fix vhost_iotlb_add_range_ctx() to handle the range [0, ULONG_MAX]   by splitting it into two entries.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48862` to fix the vulnerability.
