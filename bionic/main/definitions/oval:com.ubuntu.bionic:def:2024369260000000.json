		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/pseries/iommu: LPAR panics during boot up with a frozen PEAt the time of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmwareproperty ibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCIbus the PE is attached to.There are execptions where the partition firmware might not provide thisproperty for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of the scenario iswhere the firmware has frozen the PE due to some error condition. ThisPE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system is reinitialized.Within this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PE will bepresented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing.Today, under these circumstances, the LPAR oopses with NULL pointerdereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.
