		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing/osnoise: Do not unregister events twiceNicolas reported that using: # trace-cmd record -e all -M 10 -p osnoise --pollResulted in the following kernel warning: ------------[ cut here ]------------ WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1217 at kernel/tracepoint.c:404tracepoint_probe_unregister+0x280/0x370 [...] CPU: 0 PID: 1217 Comm: trace-cmd Not tainted5.17.0-rc6-next-20220307-nico+ #19 RIP: 0010:tracepoint_probe_unregister+0x280/0x370 [...] CR2: 00007ff919b29497 CR3: 0000000109da4005 CR4: 0000000000170ef0 Call Trace:  <TASK>  osnoise_workload_stop+0x36/0x90  tracing_set_tracer+0x108/0x260  tracing_set_trace_write+0x94/0xd0  ? __check_object_size.part.0+0x10a/0x150  ? selinux_file_permission+0x104/0x150  vfs_write+0xb5/0x290  ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0  do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae RIP: 0033:0x7ff919a18127 [...] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---The warning complains about an attempt to unregister anunregistered tracepoint.This happens on trace-cmd because it first stops tracing, andthen switches the tracer to nop. Which is equivalent to:  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/  # echo osnoise > current_tracer  # echo 0 > tracing_on  # echo nop > current_tracerThe osnoise tracer stops the workload when no trace instanceis actually collecting data. This can be caused both bydisabling tracing or disabling the tracer itself.To avoid unregistering events twice, use the existingtrace_osnoise_callback_enabled variable to check if the events(and the workload) are actually active before trying todeactivate them.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48848` to fix the vulnerability.
