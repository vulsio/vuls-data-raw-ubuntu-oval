		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit Arm guest OSusers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) because certainbit iteration is mishandled. In a number of places bitmaps are being usedby the hypervisor to track certain state. Iteration over all bits involvesfunctions which may misbehave in certain corner cases: On 32-bit Armaccesses to bitmaps with bit a count which is a multiple of 32, an out ofbounds access may occur. A malicious guest may cause a hypervisor crash orhang, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen arevulnerable. 32-bit Arm systems are vulnerable. 64-bit Arm systems are notvulnerable.",
