		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vdpa_sim: avoid putting an uninitialized iova_domain The system will crashif we put an uninitialized iova_domain, this could happen when an erroroccurs before initializing the iova_domain in vdpasim_create(). BUG: kernelNULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000 ... RIP:0010:__cpuhp_state_remove_instance+0x96/0x1c0 ... Call Trace: <TASK>put_iova_domain+0x29/0x220 vdpasim_free+0xd1/0x120 [vdpa_sim]vdpa_release_dev+0x21/0x40 [vdpa] device_release+0x33/0x90kobject_release+0x63/0x160 vdpasim_create+0x127/0x2a0 [vdpa_sim]vdpasim_net_dev_add+0x7d/0xfe [vdpa_sim_net]vdpa_nl_cmd_dev_add_set_doit+0xe1/0x1a0 [vdpa]genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x112/0x140 genl_rcv_msg+0xdf/0x1d0 ... So we mustmake sure the iova_domain is already initialized before put it. Inaddition, we may get the following warning in this case: WARNING: ...drivers/iommu/iova.c:344 iova_cache_put+0x58/0x70 So we must make sure theiova_cache_put() is invoked only if the iova_cache_get() is alreadyinvoked. Let's fix it together.",
