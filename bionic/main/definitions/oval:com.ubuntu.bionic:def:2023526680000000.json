		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:zoned: fix lock ordering in btrfs_zone_activate() The btrfs CI reported alockdep warning as follows by running generic generic/129. WARNING:possible circular locking dependency detected 6.7.0-rc5+ #1 Not tainted------------------------------------------------------ kworker/u5:5/793427is trying to acquire lock: ffff88813256d028 (&cache->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at:btrfs_zone_finish_one_bg+0x5e/0x130 but task is already holding lock:ffff88810a23a318 (&fs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at:btrfs_zone_finish_one_bg+0x34/0x130 which lock already depends on the newlock. the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is: -> #1(&fs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock){+.+.}-{2:2}: ... -> #0(&cache->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}: ... This is because we takefs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock after a block_group's lock inbtrfs_zone_activate() while doing the opposite in other places. Fix theissue by expanding the fs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock's critical section andtaking it before a block_group's lock.",
