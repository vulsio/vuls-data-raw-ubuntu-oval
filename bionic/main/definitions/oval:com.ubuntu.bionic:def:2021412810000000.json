		"Description": "Synapse is a package for Matrix homeservers written in Python 3/Twisted.Prior to version 1.47.1, Synapse instances with the media repositoryenabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into anarbitrary directory. No authentication is required for the affectedendpoint. The last 2 directories and file name of the path are chosenrandomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limitsthe impact. Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected.Homeservers with a federation whitelist are also unaffected, since Synapsewill check the remote hostname, including the trailing `../`s, against thewhitelist. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.47.1 or later. Serveradministrators using a reverse proxy could, at the expense of losing mediafunctionality, may block the certain endpoints as a workaround.Alternatively, non-containerized deployments can be adapted to use thehardened systemd config.",
