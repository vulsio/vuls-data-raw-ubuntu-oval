		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: huge_memory: fix misused mapping_large_folio_support() for anon foliosWhen I did a large folios split test, a WARNING \"[ 5059.122759][ T166]Cannot split file folio to non-0 order\" was triggered.  But the test casesare only for anonmous folios.  while mapping_large_folio_support() is onlyreasonable for page cache folios.In split_huge_page_to_list_to_order(), the folio passed tomapping_large_folio_support() maybe anonmous folio.  The folio_test_anon()check is missing.  So the split of the anonmous THP is failed.  This isalso the same for shmem_mapping().  We'd better add a check for both.  Butthe shmem_mapping() in __split_huge_page() is not involved, as foranonmous folios, the end parameter is set to -1, so (head[i].index >= end)is always false.  shmem_mapping() is not called.Also add a VM_WARN_ON_ONCE() in mapping_large_folio_support() for anonmapping, So we can detect the wrong use more easily.THP folios maybe exist in the pagecache even the file system doesn'tsupport large folio, it is because when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE isenabled, khugepaged will try to collapse read-only file-backed pages toTHP.  But the mapping does not actually support multi order large foliosproperly.Using /sys/kernel/debug/split_huge_pages to verify this, with this patch,large anon THP is successfully split and the warning is ceased.",
