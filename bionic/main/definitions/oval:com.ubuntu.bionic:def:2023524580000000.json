		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: block:add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size Beforecalling add partition or resize partition, there is no check on whether thelength is aligned with the logical block size. If the logical block size ofthe disk is larger than 512 bytes, then the partition size maybe not themultiple of the logical block size, and when the last sector is read,bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size, resulting in an IO error if thesize of the read command is smaller than the logical block size.Ifintegrity data is supported, this will also result in a null pointerdereference when calling bio_integrity_free.",
