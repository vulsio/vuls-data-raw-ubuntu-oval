		"Title": "CVE-2023-24534 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"Description": "HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, evenwhen parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service.Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function usedto parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory thanrequired to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behaviorto cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a smallrequest, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service.With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory requiredto hold parsed headers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-24534` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngolang-1.18 - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4\ngolang-1.18-go - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4\ngolang-1.18-src - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4\nNo subscription required",
