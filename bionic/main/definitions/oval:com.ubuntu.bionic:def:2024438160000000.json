		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macrousagesOn big endian architectures, it is possible to run into a memory out ofbounds pointer dereference when FCP targets are zoned.In lpfc_prep_embed_io, the memcpy(ptr, fcp_cmnd, sgl->sge_len) isreferencing a little endian formatted sgl->sge_len value.  So, the memcpycan cause big endian systems to crash.Redefine the *sgl ptr as a struct sli4_sge_le to make it clear that we arereferring to a little endian formatted data structure.  And, update theroutine with proper le32_to_cpu macro usages.",
