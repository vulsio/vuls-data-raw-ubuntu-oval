		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iocost: Fix divide-by-zero on donation from low hweight cgroupThe donation calculation logic assumes that the donor has non-zeroafter-donation hweight, so the lowest active hweight a donating cgroup canhave is 2 so that it can donate 1 while keeping the other 1 for itself.Earlier, we only donated from cgroups with sizable surpluses so thiscondition was always true. However, with the precise donation algorithmimplemented, f1de2439ec43 (\"blk-iocost: revamp donation amountdetermination\") made the donation amount calculation exact enabling evenlowhweight cgroups to donate.This means that in rare occasions, a cgroup with active hweight of 1 canenter donation calculation triggering the following warning and then adivide-by-zero oops.
