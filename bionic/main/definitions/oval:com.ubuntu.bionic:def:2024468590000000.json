		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: panasonic-laptop: Fix SINF array out of bounds accessesThe panasonic laptop code in various places uses the SINF array with indexvalues of 0 - SINF_CUR_BRIGHT(0x0d) without checking that the SINF arrayis big enough.Not all panasonic laptops have this many SINF array entries, for examplethe Toughbook CF-18 model only has 10 SINF array entries. So it onlysupports the AC+DC brightness entries and mute.Check that the SINF array has a minimum size which covers all AC+DCbrightness entries and refuse to load if the SINF array is smaller.For higher SINF indexes hide the sysfs attributes when the SINF arraydoes not contain an entry for that attribute, avoiding show()/store()accessing the array out of bounds and add bounds checking to the probe()and resume() code accessing these.",
