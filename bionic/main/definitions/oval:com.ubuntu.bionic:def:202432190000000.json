		"title": "CVE-2024-3219 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.The “socket” module provides a pure-Python fallback to thesocket.socketpair() function for platforms that don’t support AF_UNIX,such as Windows. This pure-Python implementation uses AF_INET orAF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connectionbetween the two sockets was not verified before passing the two socketsback to the user, which leaves the server socket vulnerable to aconnection race from a malicious local peer.Platforms that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected bythis vulnerability. Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due tothe vulnerable API not being included.",
