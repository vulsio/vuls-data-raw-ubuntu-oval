There needs to a check toprevent it being out of bounds.  The \"config.offset\" and\"dev->config_size\" variables are both type u32.  So if the offset ifout of bounds then the \"dev->config_size - config.offset\" subtractionresults in a very high u32 value.  The out of bounds offset can resultin memory corruption.",
