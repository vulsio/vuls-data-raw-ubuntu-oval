		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:afs: Fix endless loop in directory parsingIf a directory has a block with only \".__afsXXXX\" files in it (fromuncompleted silly-rename), these .__afsXXXX files are skipped but withoutadvancing the file position in the dir_context.  This leads toafs_dir_iterate() repeating the block again and again.Fix this by making the code that skips the .__afsXXXX file also manuallyadvance the file position.The symptoms are a soft lookup:        watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#3 stuck for 52s!
