		"title": "CVE-2024-26716 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_stateCurrently, the function update_port_device_state gets the usb_hub fromudev->parent by calling usb_hub_to_struct_hub. However, in case theactconfig or the maxchild is 0, the usb_hub would be NULL and upon furtheraccessing to get port_dev would result in null pointer dereference. Fixthis by introducing an if check after the usb_hub is populated.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26716` to fix the vulnerability.
