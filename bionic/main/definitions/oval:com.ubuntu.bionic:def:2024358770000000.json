		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mm/pat: fix VM_PAT handling in COW mappings PAT handling won't do theright thing in COW mappings: the first PTE (or, in fact, all PTEs) can bereplaced during write faults to point at anon folios. Reliably recoveringthe correct PFN and cachemode using follow_phys() from PTEs will not workin COW mappings. Using follow_phys(), we might just get theaddress+protection of the anon folio (which is very wrong), or fail onswap/nonswap entries, failing follow_phys() and triggering a WARN_ON_ONCE()in untrack_pfn() and track_pfn_copy(), not properly callingfree_pfn_range(). In free_pfn_range(), we either wouldn't callmemtype_free() or would call it with the wrong range, possibly leakingmemory. To fix that, let's update follow_phys() to refuse returning anonfolios, and fallback to using the stored PFN inside vma->vm_pgoff for COWmappings if we run into that. We will now properly handle untrack_pfn()with COW mappings, where we don't need the cachemode. We'll have to failfork()->track_pfn_copy() if the first page was replaced by an anon folio,though: we'd have to store the cachemode in the VMA to make this work,likely growing the VMA size. For now, lets keep it simple and lettrack_pfn_copy() just fail in that case: it would have failed in the pastwith swap/nonswap entries already, and it would have done the wrong thingwith anon folios.
