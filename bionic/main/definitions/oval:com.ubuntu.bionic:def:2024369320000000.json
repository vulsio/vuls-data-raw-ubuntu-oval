		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removalSince thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it canrun in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may freethe struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has beenchecked against NULL.If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memorythat has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() aroundthe cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at thesame time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.Cc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+",
