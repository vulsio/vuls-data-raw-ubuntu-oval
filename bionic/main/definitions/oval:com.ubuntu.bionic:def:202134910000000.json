		"Title": "CVE-2021-3491 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high",
		"Description": "The io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed the MAX_RW_COUNT limitto be bypassed in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which led to negativevalues being usedin mem_rw when reading /proc/<PID>/mem. This could be usedto create a heap overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in thekernel. It was addressed via commit d1f82808877b (\"io_uring: truncatelengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers\") (v5.13-rc1) andbackported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It wasintroduced in ddf0322db79c (\"io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS\")(v5.7-rc1).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3491` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
