		"title": "CVE-2021-26932 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used byXen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where anumber of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failureof each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver thenloops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on the successor failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, theLinux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectivelyimplying their success from the success of related batch elements. In othercases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batchelements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possibleto properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backendsrunning in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modesare not vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and drivers/xen/gntdev.c.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-26932` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1040-gke - 5.4.0-1040.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1013-gkeop - 5.4.0-1013.14~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1085-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1085.90\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1102-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1102.111\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1018-dell300x - 4.15.0-1018.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
