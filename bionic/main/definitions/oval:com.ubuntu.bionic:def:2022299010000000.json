    "Title": "CVE-2022-29901 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "Intel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that is able to bypass their retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker with unprivileged user access can hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions. Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64 processors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29901` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-aws - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-azure - 5.4.0-1095.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-gcp - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-ibm - 5.4.0-1037.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1135-kvm - 4.15.0-1135.140\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-oracle - 5.4.0-1087.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1074-raspi - 5.4.0-1074.85~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1127-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1127.135\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-generic - 4.15.0-204.215\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-204-lowlatency - 4.15.0-204.215\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-aws - 4.15.0-1150.163\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1089-aws - 5.4.0-1089.97~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1161-azure - 4.15.0-1161.176\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1095-azure - 5.4.0-1095.101~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1060-dell300x - 4.15.0-1060.65\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1145-gcp - 4.15.0-1145.161\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1093-gcp - 5.4.0-1093.102~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-generic - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-132-lowlatency - 5.4.0-132.148~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1037-ibm - 5.4.0-1037.42~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-oracle - 4.15.0-1114.125\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1087-oracle - 5.4.0-1087.96~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1145-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1145.155\nNo subscription required",
