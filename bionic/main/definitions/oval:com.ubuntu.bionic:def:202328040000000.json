		"description": "A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo inh2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. Thevulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for whichthe range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, anattacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that containsout-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting to decompress suchimage using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault or bufferoverflows, causing an application to crash.",
