		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Avoid uninitialized value in BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD[Changes from V1: - Use a default branch in the switch statement to initialize `val'.]GCC warns that `val' may be used uninitialized in theBPF_CRE_READ_BITFIELD macro, defined in bpf_core_read.h as:\t[...]\tunsigned long long val;\t\t\t\t\t\t      \\\t[...]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \\\tswitch (__CORE_RELO(s, field, BYTE_SIZE)) {\t\t\t      \\\tcase 1: val = *(const unsigned char *)p; break;\t\t\t      \\\tcase 2: val = *(const unsigned short *)p; break;\t\t      \\\tcase 4: val = *(const unsigned int *)p; break;\t\t\t      \\\tcase 8: val = *(const unsigned long long *)p; break;\t\t      \\        }       \t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \\\t[...]\tval;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \\\t}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \\This patch adds a default entry in the switch statement that sets`val' to zero in order to avoid the warning, and random values to beused in case __builtin_preserve_field_info returns unexpected valuesfor BPF_FIELD_BYTE_SIZE.Tested in bpf-next master.No regressions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42161` to fix the vulnerability.
