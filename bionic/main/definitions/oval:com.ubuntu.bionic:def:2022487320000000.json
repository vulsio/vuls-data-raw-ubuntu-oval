		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: fix off by one in BIOS boundary checking Bounds checking whenparsing init scripts embedded in the BIOS reject access to the last byte.This causes driver initialization to fail on Apple eMac's with GeForce 2 MXGPUs, leaving the system with no working console. This is probably onlyseen on OpenFirmware machines like PowerPC Macs because the BIOS imageprovided by OF is only the used parts of the ROM, not a power-of-two blocksread from PCI directly so PCs always have empty bytes at the end that arenever accessed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48732` to fix the vulnerability.
