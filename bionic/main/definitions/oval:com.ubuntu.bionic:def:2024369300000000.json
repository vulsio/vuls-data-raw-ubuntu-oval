		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: fix null pointer dereference within spi_syncIf spi_sync() is called with the non-empty queue and the same spi_messageis then reused, the complete callback for the message remains set whilethe context is cleared, leading to a null pointer dereference when thecallback is invoked from spi_finalize_current_message().With function inlining disabled, the call stack might look like this:  _raw_spin_lock_irqsave from complete_with_flags+0x18/0x58  complete_with_flags from spi_complete+0x8/0xc  spi_complete from spi_finalize_current_message+0xec/0x184  spi_finalize_current_message from spi_transfer_one_message+0x2a8/0x474  spi_transfer_one_message from __spi_pump_transfer_message+0x104/0x230  __spi_pump_transfer_message from __spi_transfer_message_noqueue+0x30/0xc4  __spi_transfer_message_noqueue from __spi_sync+0x204/0x248  __spi_sync from spi_sync+0x24/0x3c  spi_sync from mcp251xfd_regmap_crc_read+0x124/0x28c [mcp251xfd]  mcp251xfd_regmap_crc_read [mcp251xfd] from _regmap_raw_read+0xf8/0x154  _regmap_raw_read from _regmap_bus_read+0x44/0x70  _regmap_bus_read from _regmap_read+0x60/0xd8  _regmap_read from regmap_read+0x3c/0x5c  regmap_read from mcp251xfd_alloc_can_err_skb+0x1c/0x54 [mcp251xfd]  mcp251xfd_alloc_can_err_skb [mcp251xfd] from mcp251xfd_irq+0x194/0xe70[mcp251xfd]  mcp251xfd_irq [mcp251xfd] from irq_thread_fn+0x1c/0x78  irq_thread_fn from irq_thread+0x118/0x1f4  irq_thread from kthread+0xd8/0xf4  kthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x28Fix this by also setting message->complete to NULL when the transfer iscomplete.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36930` to fix the vulnerability.
