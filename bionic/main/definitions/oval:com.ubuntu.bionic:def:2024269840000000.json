Every so oftenpt->memory->ptrs is NULL. This ptrs ptr is set in the nv50_instobj_acquirecalled from nvkm_kmap. If Thread A and Thread B both get tonv50_instobj_acquire around the same time, and Thread A hits therefcount_set line, and in lockstep thread B succeeds atrefcount_inc_not_zero, there is a chance the ptrs value won't have beenstored since refcount_set is unordered. Force a memory barrier here, Ipicked smp_mb, since we want it on all CPUs and it's write followed by aread. v2: use paired smp_rmb/smp_wmb.",
