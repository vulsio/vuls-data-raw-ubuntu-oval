		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: core: Fix NULL module pointer assignment at card initThe commit 81033c6b584b (\"ALSA: core: Warn on empty module\")introduced a WARN_ON() for a NULL module pointer passed at snd_cardobject creation, and it also wraps the code around it with '#ifdefMODULE'.  This works in most cases, but the devils are always indetails.  \"MODULE\" is defined when the target code (i.e. the soundcore) is built as a module; but this doesn't mean that the caller isalso built-in or not.  Namely, when only the sound core is built-in(CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a module (CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m),the passed module pointer is ignored even if it's non-NULL, andcard->module remains as NULL.  This would result in the missing modulereference up/down at the device open/close, leading to a race with thecode execution after the module removal.For addressing the bug, move the assignment of card->module again outof ifdef.  The WARN_ON() is still wrapped with ifdef because themodule can be really NULL when all sound drivers are built-in.Note that we keep 'ifdef MODULE' for WARN_ON(), otherwise it wouldlead to a false-positive NULL module check.  Admittedly it won't catchperfectly, i.e. no check is performed when CONFIG_SND=y.  But, it's noreal problem as it's only for debugging, and the condition is prettyrare.",
