		"Title": "CVE-2020-15168 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low",
		"Description": "node-fetch before versions 2.6.1 and 3.0.0-beta.9 did not honor the sizeoption after following a redirect, which means that when a content size wasover the limit, a FetchError would never get thrown and the process wouldend without failure. For most people, this fix will have a little or noimpact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above asize, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don'tdouble-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JSthread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost youmoney in computing.",
