    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** There is an illegal address access at ext/testcase.c in libsolv.a in libsolv through 0.7.2 that will cause a denial of service. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue stating that the issue affects the test suite and not the underlying library. It cannot be exploited in any real-world application. It was discovered that libsolv incorrectly handled certain malformed input. An attacker could use this issue to cause libsolv to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
