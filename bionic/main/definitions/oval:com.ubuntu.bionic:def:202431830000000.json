		"description": "A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ isencrypted using the client’s session key. This key is different for eachnew session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, theticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly.For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principalrandomly-generated salt and the user’s password.If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able toretrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted bytheir own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, theattacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able todecrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find theprincipal’s password).",
