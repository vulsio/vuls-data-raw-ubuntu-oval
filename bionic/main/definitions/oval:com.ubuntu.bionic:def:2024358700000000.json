		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:smb: client: fix UAF in smb2_reconnect_server()The UAF bug is due to smb2_reconnect_server() accessing a session thatis already being teared down by another thread that is executing__cifs_put_smb_ses().  This can happen when (a) the client hasconnection to the server but no session or (b) another thread ends upsetting @ses->ses_status again to something different thanSES_EXITING.To fix this, we need to make sure to unconditionally set@ses->ses_status to SES_EXITING and prevent any other threads fromsetting a new status while we're still tearing it down.The following can be reproduced by adding some delay to right afterthe ipc is freed in __cifs_put_smb_ses() - which will givesmb2_reconnect_server() worker a chance to run and then accessing@ses->ipc:kinit ...mount.cifs //srv/share /mnt/1 -o sec=krb5,nohandlecache,echo_interval=10[disconnect srv]ls /mnt/1 &>/dev/nullsleep 30kdestroy[reconnect srv]sleep 10umount /mnt/1...CIFS: VFS: Verify user has a krb5 ticket and keyutils is installedCIFS: VFS: \\\\srv Send error in SessSetup = -126CIFS: VFS: Verify user has a krb5 ticket and keyutils is installedCIFS: VFS: \\\\srv Send error in SessSetup = -126general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTICPU: 3 PID: 50 Comm: kworker/3:1 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc2 #1Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-1.fc3904/01/2014Workqueue: cifsiod smb2_reconnect_server [cifs]RIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x33/0xf0Code: 4f 08 48 85 d2 74 42 48 85 c9 74 59 48 b8 00 01 00 00 00 00 adde 48 39 c2 74 61 48 b8 22 01 00 00 00 00 74 69 <48> 8b 01 48 39 f8 757b 48 8b 72 08 48 39 c6 0f 85 88 00 00 00 b8RSP: 0018:ffffc900001bfd70 EFLAGS: 00010a83RAX: dead000000000122 RBX: ffff88810da53838 RCX: 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6bRDX: 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b RSI: ffffffffc02f6878 RDI: ffff88810da53800RBP: ffff88810da53800 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffff88810c064000R13: 0000000000000001 R14: ffff88810c064000 R15: ffff8881039cc000FS: 0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff888157c00000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007fe3728b1000 CR3: 000000010caa4000 CR4: 0000000000750ef0PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <TASK> ? die_addr+0x36/0x90 ? exc_general_protection+0x1c1/0x3f0 ? asm_exc_general_protection+0x26/0x30 ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x33/0xf0 __cifs_put_smb_ses+0x1ae/0x500 [cifs] smb2_reconnect_server+0x4ed/0x710 [cifs] process_one_work+0x205/0x6b0 worker_thread+0x191/0x360 ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10 kthread+0xe2/0x110 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork+0x34/0x50 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 </TASK>",
