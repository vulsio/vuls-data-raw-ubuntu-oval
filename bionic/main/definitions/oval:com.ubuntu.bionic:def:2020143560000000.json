		"Title": "CVE-2020-14356 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel cgroupv2 subsystem in versions before 5.7.10 was found in the way when reboot the system. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the cgroup v2 subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly gain administrative privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-14356` to fix the vulnerability.
