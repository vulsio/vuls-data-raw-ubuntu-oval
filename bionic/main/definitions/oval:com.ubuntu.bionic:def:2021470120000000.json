		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr Our code analyzer reported aUAF. In siw_alloc_mr(), it calls siw_mr_add_mem(mr,..). In theimplementation of siw_mr_add_mem(), mem is assigned to mr->mem and then memis freed via kfree(mem) if xa_alloc_cyclic() failed. Here, mr->mem stillpoint to a freed object. After, the execution continue up to the err_outbranch of siw_alloc_mr, and the freed mr->mem is used insiw_mr_drop_mem(mr). My patch moves \"mr->mem = mem\" behind the if(xa_alloc_cyclic(..)<0) {} section, to avoid the uaf.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47012` to fix the vulnerability.
