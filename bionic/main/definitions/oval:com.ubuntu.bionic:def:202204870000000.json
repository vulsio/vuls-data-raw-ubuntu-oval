    "Title": "CVE-2022-0487 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. Zhihua Yao discovered that the MOXART SD/MMC driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-0487` to fix the vulnerability.
