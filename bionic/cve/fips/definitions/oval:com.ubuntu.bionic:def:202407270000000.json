		"description": "Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may leadOpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack Impactsummary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrustedsources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can containcertificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does notcorrectly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereferencethat results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 filesfrom an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application willbe vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(),PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed asimilar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function isrelated to writing data we do not consider it security significant. TheFIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-0727` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.13+esm1\nopenssl1.0 - 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.13+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
