		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gpio: davinci: Validate the obtained number of IRQsValue of pdata->gpio_unbanked is taken from Device Tree. In case of brokenDT due to any error this value can be any. Without this value validationthere can be out of chips->irqs array boundaries access indavinci_gpio_probe().Validate the obtained nirq value so that it won't exceed the maximumnumber of IRQs per bank.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42092` to fix the vulnerability.
