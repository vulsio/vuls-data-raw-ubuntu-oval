		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set withtimeout While the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race allows itto collect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while it is beingreleased from the commit path. Mingi Cho originally reported this issue ina different path in 6.1.x with a pipapo set with low timeouts which is notpossible upstream since 7395dfacfff6 (\"netfilter: nf_tables: use timestampto check for set element timeout\"). Fix this by setting on the dead flagfor anonymous sets to skip async gc in this case. According to 08e4c8c5919f(\"netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on transaction abort\"), Florianplans to accelerate abort path by releasing objects via workqueue,therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abort path too.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26643` to fix the vulnerability.
