		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak during rehash The rehash delayed workmigrates filters from one region to another. This is done by iterating overall chunks (all the filters with the same priority) in the region and ineach chunk iterating over all the filters. If the migration fails, the codetries to migrate the filters back to the old region. However, the rollbackitself can also fail in which case another migration will be erroneouslyperformed. Besides the fact that this ping pong is not a very good idea, italso creates a problem. Each virtual chunk references two chunks: Thecurrently used one ('vchunk->chunk') and a backup ('vchunk->chunk2').During migration the first holds the chunk we want to migrate filters toand the second holds the chunk we are migrating filters from. The codecurrently assumes - but does not verify - that the backup chunk does notexist (NULL) if the currently used chunk does not reference the targetregion. This assumption breaks when we are trying to rollback a rollback,resulting in the backup chunk being overwritten and leaked [1]. Fix by notrolling back a failed rollback and add a warning to avoid future cases.
