		"description": "Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with anunusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations andfull access to internals. When Git asks for credentials via a terminalprompt (i.e. without using any credential helper), it prints out the hostname for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or apassword. At this stage, any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already,and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that containANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g.into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact theyare then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker's control.This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which areincluded in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.1, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3,v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Usersunable to upgrade should avoid cloning from untrusted URLs, especiallyrecursive clones.",
