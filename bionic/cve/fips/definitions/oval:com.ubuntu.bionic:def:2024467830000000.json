		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp_bpf: fix return value of tcp_bpf_sendmsg()When we cork messages in psock->cork, the last message triggers theflushing will result in sending a sk_msg larger than the currentmessage size. In this case, in tcp_bpf_send_verdict(), 'copied' becomesnegative at least in the following case:468         case __SK_DROP:469         default:470                 sk_msg_free_partial(sk, msg, tosend);471                 sk_msg_apply_bytes(psock, tosend);472                 *copied -= (tosend + delta); // <==== HERE473                 return -EACCES;Therefore, it could lead to the following BUG with a proper value of'copied' (thanks to syzbot). We should not use negative 'copied' as areturn value here.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  kernel BUG at net/socket.c:733!
