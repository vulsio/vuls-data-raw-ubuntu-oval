		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:nfc: fix races in nfc_llcp_sock_get() and nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn() Sili Luoreported a race in nfc_llcp_sock_get(), leading to UAF. Getting a referenceon the socket found in a lookup while holding a lock should happen beforereleasing the lock. nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn() has a similar problem. Finallynfc_llcp_recv_snl() needs to make sure the socket found bynfc_llcp_sock_from_sn() does not disappear.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52502` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-lowlatency - 4.15.0-231.243\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1158-kvm - 4.15.0-1158.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1175-aws - 4.15.0-1175.188\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1183-azure - 4.15.0-1183.198\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-gcp - 4.15.0-1168.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-oracle - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
