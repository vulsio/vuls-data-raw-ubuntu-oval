		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:neighbour: allow NUD_NOARP entries to be forced GCed IFF_POINTOPOINTinterfaces use NUD_NOARP entries for IPv6. It's possible to fill up theneighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow for validconnections after that. This behaviour is more prevalent after commit58956317c8de (\"neighbor: Improve garbage collection\") is applied, as itprevents removal from entries that are not NUD_FAILED, unless they are morethan 5s old.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47109` to fix the vulnerability.
