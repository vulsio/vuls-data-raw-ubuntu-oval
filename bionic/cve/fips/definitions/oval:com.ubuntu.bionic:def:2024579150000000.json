		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: u_serial: Disable ep before setting port to null to fix thecrash caused by port being nullConsidering that in some extreme cases, when performing theunbinding operation, gserial_disconnect has cleared gser->ioport,which triggers gadget reconfiguration, and then calls gs_read_complete,resulting in access to a null pointer. Therefore, ep is disabled beforegserial_disconnect sets port to null to prevent this from happening.Call trace: gs_read_complete+0x58/0x240 usb_gadget_giveback_request+0x40/0x160 dwc3_remove_requests+0x170/0x484 dwc3_ep0_out_start+0xb0/0x1d4 __dwc3_gadget_start+0x25c/0x720 kretprobe_trampoline.cfi_jt+0x0/0x8 kretprobe_trampoline.cfi_jt+0x0/0x8 udc_bind_to_driver+0x1d8/0x300 usb_gadget_probe_driver+0xa8/0x1dc gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store+0x13c/0x188 configfs_write_iter+0x160/0x1f4 vfs_write+0x2d0/0x40c ksys_write+0x7c/0xf0 __arm64_sys_write+0x20/0x30 invoke_syscall+0x60/0x150 el0_svc_common+0x8c/0xf8 do_el0_svc+0x28/0xa0 el0_svc+0x24/0x84",
