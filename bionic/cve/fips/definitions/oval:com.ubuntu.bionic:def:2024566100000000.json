That list is protected by the report_filterlist_lock*non-raw* spinlock which may sleep on RT kernels.Since KCSAN may report data races in any context, convert it to araw_spinlock.This requires being careful about when to allocate memory for the filterlist itself which can be done via KCSAN's debugfs interface. Concurrentmodification of the filter list via debugfs should be rare: the chosenstrategy is to optimistically pre-allocate memory before the criticalsection and discard if unused.",
