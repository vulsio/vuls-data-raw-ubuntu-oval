		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:eth: bnxt: always recalculate features after XDP clearing, fix null-derefRecalculate features when XDP is detached.Before:  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro  rx-gro-hw: off [requested on]After:  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp obj xdp_dummy.bpf.o sec xdp  # ip li set dev eth0 xdp off  # ethtool -k eth0 | grep gro  rx-gro-hw: onThe fact that HW-GRO doesn't get re-enabled automatically is justa minor annoyance. The real issue is that the features will randomlycome back during another reconfiguration which just happens to invokenetdev_update_features(). The driver doesn't handle reconfiguringtwo things at a time very robustly.Starting with commit 98ba1d931f61 (\"bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in__bnxt_reserve_rings()\") we only reconfigure the RSS hash tableif the \"effective\" number of Rx rings has changed. If HW-GRO isenabled \"effective\" number of rings is 2x what user sees.So if we are in the bad state, with HW-GRO re-enablement \"pending\"after XDP off, and we lower the rings by / 2 - the HW-GRO ringsdoing 2x and the ethtool -L doing / 2 may cancel each other out,and the:  if (old_rx_rings != bp->hw_resc.resv_rx_rings &&condition in __bnxt_reserve_rings() will be false.The RSS map won't get updated, and we'll crash with:  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000168  RIP: 0010:__bnxt_hwrm_vnic_set_rss+0x13a/0x1a0    bnxt_hwrm_vnic_rss_cfg_p5+0x47/0x180    __bnxt_setup_vnic_p5+0x58/0x110    bnxt_init_nic+0xb72/0xf50    __bnxt_open_nic+0x40d/0xab0    bnxt_open_nic+0x2b/0x60    ethtool_set_channels+0x18c/0x1d0As we try to access a freed ring.The issue is present since XDP support was added, really, butprior to commit 98ba1d931f61 (\"bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in__bnxt_reserve_rings()\") it wasn't causing major issues.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2025-21682` to fix the vulnerability.
