		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: arm64: Unregister redistributor for failed vCPU creationAlex reports that syzkaller has managed to trigger a use-after-free whentearing down a VM:  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in kvm_put_kvm+0x300/0xe68virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:5769  Read of size 8 at addr ffffff801c6890d0 by task syz.3.2219/10758  CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 10758 Comm: syz.3.2219 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc6-dirty#64  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)  Call trace:   dump_backtrace+0x17c/0x1a8 arch/arm64/kernel/stacktrace.c:317   show_stack+0x2c/0x3c arch/arm64/kernel/stacktrace.c:324   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:93 [inline]   dump_stack_lvl+0x94/0xc0 lib/dump_stack.c:119   print_report+0x144/0x7a4 mm/kasan/report.c:377   kasan_report+0xcc/0x128 mm/kasan/report.c:601   __asan_report_load8_noabort+0x20/0x2c mm/kasan/report_generic.c:381   kvm_put_kvm+0x300/0xe68 virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:5769   kvm_vm_release+0x4c/0x60 virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1409   __fput+0x198/0x71c fs/file_table.c:422   ____fput+0x20/0x30 fs/file_table.c:450   task_work_run+0x1cc/0x23c kernel/task_work.c:228   do_notify_resume+0x144/0x1a0 include/linux/resume_user_mode.h:50   el0_svc+0x64/0x68 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:169   el0t_64_sync_handler+0x90/0xfc arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:730   el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:598Upon closer inspection, it appears that we do not properly tear down theMMIO registration for a vCPU that fails creation late in the game, e.g.a vCPU w/ the same ID already exists in the VM.It is important to consider the context of commit that introduced this bugby moving the unregistration out of __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). Thatchange correctly sought to avoid an srcu v. config_lock inversion bybreaking up the vCPU teardown into two parts, one guarded by theconfig_lock.Fix the use-after-free while avoiding lock inversion by adding aspecial-cased unregistration to __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). This is safebecause failed vCPUs are torn down outside of the config_lock.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50114` to fix the vulnerability.
