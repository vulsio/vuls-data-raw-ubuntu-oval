		"title": "CVE-2024-36953 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:arm64: vgic-v2: Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr()vgic_v2_parse_attr() is responsible for finding the vCPU that matches theuser-provided CPUID, which (of course) may not be valid. If the ID isinvalid, kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() returns NULL, which isn't handled gracefully.Similar to the GICv3 uaccess flow, check that kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() actuallyreturns something and fail the ioctl if not.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36953` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-lowlatency - 4.15.0-231.243\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-202-generic - 5.4.0-202.222~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-202-lowlatency - 5.4.0-202.222~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1158-kvm - 4.15.0-1158.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1175-aws - 4.15.0-1175.188\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1183-azure - 4.15.0-1183.198\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-gcp - 4.15.0-1168.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1140-gcp - 5.4.0-1140.149~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-ibm - 5.4.0-1083.88~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-oracle - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
