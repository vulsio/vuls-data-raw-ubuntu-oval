		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ubifs:Fix races between xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations UBIFS may occursome problems with concurrent xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations,such as assertion failure, memory corruption, stale xattr value[1]. Fix itby importing a new rw-lock in @ubifs_inode to serilize write operations onxattr, concurrent read operations are still effective, just like ext4.
