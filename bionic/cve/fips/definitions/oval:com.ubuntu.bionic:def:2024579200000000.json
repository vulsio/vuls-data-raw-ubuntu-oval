		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdkfd: wq_release signals dma_fence only when availablekfd_process_wq_release() signals eviction fence bydma_fence_signal() which wanrs if dma_fenceis NULL.kfd_process->ef is initialized by kfd_process_device_init_vm()through ioctl. That means the fence is NULL for a newcreated kfd_process, and close a kfd_process rightafter open it will trigger the warning.This commit conditionally signals the eviction fencein kfd_process_wq_release() only when it is available.[  503.660882] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at drivers/dma-buf/dma-fence.c:467dma_fence_signal+0x74/0xa0[  503.782940] Workqueue: kfd_process_wq kfd_process_wq_release [amdgpu][  503.789640] RIP: 0010:dma_fence_signal+0x74/0xa0[  503.877620] Call Trace:[  503.880066]  <TASK>[  503.882168]  ? __warn+0xcd/0x260[  503.885407]  ? dma_fence_signal+0x74/0xa0[  503.889416]  ? report_bug+0x288/0x2d0[  503.893089]  ? handle_bug+0x53/0xa0[  503.896587]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x14/0x50[  503.900424]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20[  503.904616]  ? dma_fence_signal+0x74/0xa0[  503.908626]  kfd_process_wq_release+0x6b/0x370 [amdgpu][  503.914081]  process_one_work+0x654/0x10a0[  503.918186]  worker_thread+0x6c3/0xe70[  503.921943]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5[  503.926735]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5[  503.931527]  ? __kthread_parkme+0x82/0x140[  503.935631]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10[  503.939904]  kthread+0x2a8/0x380[  503.943132]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10[  503.946882]  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x70[  503.950458]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10[  503.954210]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30[  503.958142]  </TASK>[  503.960328] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---(cherry picked from commit 2774ef7625adb5fb9e9265c26a59dca7b8fd171e)",
