		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:IB/IPoIB: Fix legacy IPoIB due to wrong number of queues The cited commitcreates child PKEY interfaces over netlink will multiple tx and rx queues,but some devices doesn't support more than 1 tx and 1 rx queues. Thiscauses to a crash when traffic is sent over the PKEY interface due to theparent having a single queue but the child having multiple queues. Thispatch fixes the number of queues to 1 for legacy IPoIB at the earliestpossible point in time.
