		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: blk-mq:cancel blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue and disk_release()For avoiding to slow down queue destroy, we don't callblk_mq_quiesce_queue() in blk_cleanup_queue(), instead of delaying tocancel dispatch work in blk_release_queue(). However, this way has causedkernel oops[1], reported by Changhui. The log shows that scsi_device can befreed before running blk_release_queue(), which is expected too sincescsi_device is released after the scsi disk is closed and the scsi_deviceis removed. Fixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in bothblk_cleanup_queue() and disk_release(): 1) when disk_release() is run, thedisk has been closed, and any sync dispatch activities have been done, socanceling dispatch work is enough to quiesce filesystem I/O dispatchactivity. 2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request,and passthrough request is always explicitly allocated & freed by itscaller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activity for passthroughrequest has been done, then it is enough to just cancel dispatch work foravoiding any dispatch activity.
