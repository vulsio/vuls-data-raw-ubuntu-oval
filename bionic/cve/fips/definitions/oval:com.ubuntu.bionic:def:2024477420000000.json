		"title": "CVE-2024-47742 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware_loader: Block path traversalMost firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairlyconstrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hexnumbers or such.However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware filenames contain string components that are passed through from a device orsemi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfacesthat require root privileges) are: - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware   filename from \"ModelName\", a string that was previously parsed out of   some descriptor (\"Vital Product Data\") in lpfc_fill_vpd() - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, \"nffw.partno\"), which I   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks   like \"netronome/nic_%s\", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting   with \"netronome/nic_\". The previous case was different because there,   the \"%s\" is *at the start* of the format string.) - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided   firmware name.   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing \"..\" path components.For what it's worth, I went looking and haven't found any USB devicedrivers that use the firmware loader dangerously.",
