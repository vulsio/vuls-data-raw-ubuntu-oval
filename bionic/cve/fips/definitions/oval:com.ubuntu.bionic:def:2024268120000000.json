		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler A vulnerability exists where theeventfd for INTx signaling can be deconfigured, which unregisters the IRQhandler but still allows eventfds to be signaled with a NULL contextthrough the SET_IRQS ioctl or through unmask irqfd if the device interruptis pending. Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; theigate mutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses, and theinterrupt handler is unregistered relative to the trigger, but the irqfdpath runs asynchronous to those. The igate mutex cannot be acquired fromthe atomic context of the eventfd wake function. Disabling the irqfdrelative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible withexisting userspace. As a result, the solution implemented here movesconfiguration of the INTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of theINTx context object and irq_type configuration, rather than registration ofa particular trigger eventfd. Synchronization is added between the ioctlpath and eventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can bedynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26812` to fix the vulnerability.
