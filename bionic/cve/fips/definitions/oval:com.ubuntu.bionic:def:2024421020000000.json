		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Revert \"mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(),again\"Patch series \"mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling\".Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 formore details).This patch (of 2):This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) castfrom the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bitarchs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - thedefault settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, thediv64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We havediv64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly, if dirtythresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages, then dirty balancing is going toblow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix onepossible overflow is just moot.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42102` to fix the vulnerability.
