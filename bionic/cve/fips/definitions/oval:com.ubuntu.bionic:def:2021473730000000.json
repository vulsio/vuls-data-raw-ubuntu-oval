		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix potential VPE leak on error Inits_vpe_irq_domain_alloc, when its_vpe_init() returns an error, there is anoff-by-one in the number of VPEs to be freed. Fix it by simply passing thenumber of VPEs allocated, which is the index of the loop iterating over theVPEs.
