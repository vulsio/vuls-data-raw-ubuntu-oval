		"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handlingcomponents. An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was identified in theconvert_to_s334_1a function in isomp4/qtdemux.c. The vulnerability arisesdue to a discrepancy between the size of memory allocated to the storagearray and the loop condition i * 2 < ccpair_size. Specifically, whenccpair_size is even, the allocated size in storage does not match theloop's expected bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This bugallows for the overwriting of up to 3 bytes beyond the allocated bounds ofthe storage array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
