		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: prevent use of deleted inodesyzbot reported a WARNING in nilfs_rmdir. [1]Because the inode bitmap is corrupted, an inode with an inode number thatshould exist as a \".nilfs\" file was reassigned by nilfs_mkdir for \"file0\",causing an inode duplication during execution.  And this causes anunderflow of i_nlink in rmdir operations.The inode is used twice by the same task to unmount and remove directories\".nilfs\" and \"file0\", it trigger warning in nilfs_rmdir.Avoid to this issue, check i_nlink in nilfs_iget(), if it is 0, it meansthat this inode has been deleted, and iput is executed to reclaim it.[1]WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5824 at fs/inode.c:407 drop_nlink+0xc4/0x110fs/inode.c:407...Call Trace: <TASK> nilfs_rmdir+0x1b0/0x250 fs/nilfs2/namei.c:342 vfs_rmdir+0x3a3/0x510 fs/namei.c:4394 do_rmdir+0x3b5/0x580 fs/namei.c:4453 __do_sys_rmdir fs/namei.c:4472 [inline] __se_sys_rmdir fs/namei.c:4470 [inline] __x64_sys_rmdir+0x47/0x50 fs/namei.c:4470 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x230 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f",
