		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c:sprd: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails The PM referencecount is not expected to be incremented on return in sprd_i2c_master_xfer()and sprd_i2c_remove(). However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PMreference count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result ina reference leak here. Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keepusage counter balanced.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-36780` to fix the vulnerability.
