		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: llc:make llc_ui_sendmsg() more robust against bonding changes syzbot was ableto trick llc_ui_sendmsg(), allocating an skb with no headroom, butsubsequently trying to push 14 bytes of Ethernet header [1] Like someothers, llc_ui_sendmsg() releases the socket lock before callingsock_alloc_send_skb(). Then it acquires it again, but does not redo all thesanity checks that were performed. This fix: - Uses LL_RESERVED_SPACE() toreserve space. - Check all conditions again after socket lock is heldagain. - Do not account Ethernet header for mtu limitation.
