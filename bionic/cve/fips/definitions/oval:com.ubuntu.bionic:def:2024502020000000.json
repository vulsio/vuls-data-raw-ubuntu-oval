		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzingtest for nilfs2.The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), whichsearches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directorypage/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directoryinode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read butfails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading apage/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdatedand cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned vianilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together.",
