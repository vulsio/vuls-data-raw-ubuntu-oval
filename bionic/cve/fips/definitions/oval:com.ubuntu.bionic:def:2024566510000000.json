		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: hi311x: hi3110_can_ist(): fix potential use-after-freeThe commit a22bd630cfff (\"can: hi311x: do not report txerr and rxerrduring bus-off\") removed the reporting of rxerr and txerr even in caseof correct operation (i. e. not bus-off).The error count information added to the CAN frame after netif_rx() isa potential use after free, since there is no guarantee that the skbis in the same state. It might be freed or reused.Fix the issue by postponing the netif_rx() call in case of txerr andrxerr reporting.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-56651` to fix the vulnerability.
