		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: flow_dissector: use DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCEThe following splat is easy to reproduce upstream as well as in -stablekernels. Florian Westphal provided the following commit:  d1dab4f71d37 (\"net: add and use __skb_get_hash_symmetric_net\")but this complementary fix has been also suggested by Willem de Bruijnand it can be easily backported to -stable kernel which consists inusing DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE instead to silence the following splatgiven __skb_get_hash() is used by the nftables tracing infrastructure toto identify packets in traces.[69133.561393] ------------[ cut here ]------------[69133.561404] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 43576 at net/core/flow_dissector.c:1104__skb_flow_dissect+0x134f/[...][69133.561944] CPU: 0 PID: 43576 Comm: socat Not tainted 6.10.0-rc7+ #379[69133.561959] RIP: 0010:__skb_flow_dissect+0x134f/0x2ad0[69133.561970] Code: 83 f9 04 0f 84 b3 00 00 00 45 85 c9 0f 84 aa 00 00 0041 83 f9 02 0f 84 81 fc ffff 44 0f b7 b4 24 80 00 00 00 e9 8b f9 ff ff <0f> 0b e9 20 f3 ff ff 41 f6c6 20 0f 84 e4 ef ff ff 48 8d 7b 12 e8[69133.561979] RSP: 0018:ffffc90000006fc0 EFLAGS: 00010246[69133.561988] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffffff82f33e20 RCX:ffffffff81ab7e19[69133.561994] RDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: ffffc90000007388 RDI:ffff888103a1b418[69133.562001] RBP: ffffc90000007310 R08: 0000000000000000 R09:0000000000000000[69133.562007] R10: ffffc90000007388 R11: ffffffff810cface R12:ffff888103a1b400[69133.562013] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffffffff82f33e2a R15:ffffffff82f33e28[69133.562020] FS:  00007f40f7131740(0000) GS:ffff888390800000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000[69133.562027] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[69133.562033] CR2: 00007f40f7346ee0 CR3: 000000015d200001 CR4:00000000001706f0[69133.562040] Call Trace:[69133.562044]  <IRQ>[69133.562049]  ? __warn+0x9f/0x1a0[ 1211.841384]  ? __skb_flow_dissect+0x107e/0x2860[...][ 1211.841496]  ? bpf_flow_dissect+0x160/0x160[ 1211.841753]  __skb_get_hash+0x97/0x280[ 1211.841765]  ? __skb_get_hash_symmetric+0x230/0x230[ 1211.841776]  ? mod_find+0xbf/0xe0[ 1211.841786]  ? get_stack_info_noinstr+0x12/0xe0[ 1211.841798]  ? bpf_ksym_find+0x56/0xe0[ 1211.841807]  ? __rcu_read_unlock+0x2a/0x70[ 1211.841819]  nft_trace_init+0x1b9/0x1c0 [nf_tables][ 1211.841895]  ? nft_trace_notify+0x830/0x830 [nf_tables][ 1211.841964]  ? get_stack_info+0x2b/0x80[ 1211.841975]  ? nft_do_chain_arp+0x80/0x80 [nf_tables][ 1211.842044]  nft_do_chain+0x79c/0x850 [nf_tables]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42321` to fix the vulnerability.
