		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON Consider thefollowing sequence of events: 1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which endsup calling into shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account theblocks, we shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. Wereturn -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated. 2. Our callerdetects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after dropping themmap_lock, and retries, calling back into shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). 3.Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used. 4. Soshmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and immediatelyreturns - without releasing the page. This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller,which asserts that the page should always be consumed, unless -ENOENT isreturned. To fix this, detect if we have such a \"dangling\" page whenaccounting fails, and if so, release it before returning.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46988` to fix the vulnerability.
