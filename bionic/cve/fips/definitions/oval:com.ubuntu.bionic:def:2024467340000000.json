		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix race between direct IO write and fsync when using same fdIf we have 2 threads that are using the same file descriptor and one ofthem is doing direct IO writes while the other is doing fsync, we have arace where we can end up either:1) Attempt a fsync without holding the inode's lock, triggering an   assertion failures when assertions are enabled;2) Do an invalid memory access from the fsync task because the file private   points to memory allocated on stack by the direct IO task and it may be   used by the fsync task after the stack was destroyed.The race happens like this:1) A user space program opens a file descriptor with O_DIRECT;2) The program spawns 2 threads using libpthread for example;3) One of the threads uses the file descriptor to do direct IO writes,   while the other calls fsync using the same file descriptor.4) Call task A the thread doing direct IO writes and task B the thread   doing fsyncs;5) Task A does a direct IO write, and at btrfs_direct_write() sets the   file's private to an on stack allocated private with the member   'fsync_skip_inode_lock' set to true;6) Task B enters btrfs_sync_file() and sees that there's a private   structure associated to the file which has 'fsync_skip_inode_lock' set   to true, so it skips locking the inode's VFS lock;7) Task A completes the direct IO write, and resets the file's private to   NULL since it had no prior private and our private was stack allocated.   Then it unlocks the inode's VFS lock;8) Task B enters btrfs_get_ordered_extents_for_logging(), then the   assertion that checks the inode's VFS lock is held fails, since task B   never locked it and task A has already unlocked it.The stack trace produced is the following:   assertion failed: inode_is_locked(&inode->vfs_inode), infs/btrfs/ordered-data.c:983   ------------[ cut here ]------------   kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/ordered-data.c:983!
