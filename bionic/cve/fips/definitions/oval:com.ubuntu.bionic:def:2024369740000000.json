		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: taprio: always validate TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_PRIOMAP If oneTCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_PRIOMAP attribute has been provided,taprio_parse_mqprio_opt() must validate it, or userspace can injectarbitrary data to the kernel, the second time taprio_change() is called.First call (with valid attributes) sets dev->num_tc to a non zero value.Second call (with arbitrary mqprio attributes) returns early fromtaprio_parse_mqprio_opt() and bad things can happen.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36974` to fix the vulnerability.
