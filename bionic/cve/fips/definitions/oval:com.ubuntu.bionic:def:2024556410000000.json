Unmount and run xfs_repair XFS (dm-0): Unmounting Filesystem be6bcbcc-9921-4deb-8d16-7cc94e335fa7The system is stuck in unmount trying to lock a couple of inodes so thatthey can be purged.  The dquot corruption notice above is a clue to whathappened -- a link() call tried to set up a transaction to link a childinto a directory.  Quota reservation for the transaction failed after IOerrors shut down the filesystem, but then we forgot to unlock the inodeson our way out.
