		"title": "CVE-2024-26800 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls:fix use-after-free on failed backlog decryption When the decrypt requestgoes to the backlog and crypto_aead_decrypt returns -EBUSY,tls_do_decryption will wait until all async decryptions have completed. Ifone of them fails, tls_do_decryption will return -EBADMSG andtls_decrypt_sg jumps to the error path, releasing all the pages. But thepages have been passed to the async callback, and have already beenreleased by tls_decrypt_done. The only true async case is whencrypto_aead_decrypt returns -EINPROGRESS. With -EBUSY, we already waited sowe can tell tls_sw_recvmsg that the data is available for immediate copy,but we need to notify tls_decrypt_sg (via the new ->async_done flag) thatthe memory has already been released.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26800` to fix the vulnerability.
