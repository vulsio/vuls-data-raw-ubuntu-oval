		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fuse: Initialize beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodatefuse_notify_store(), unlike fuse_do_readpage(), does not enable pagezeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).So fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize pagecontents (including parts of the page that are beyond end-of-file)before marking the page uptodate.The current code can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized, whichmakes these uninitialized page contents visible to userspace via mmap().This is an information leak, but only affects systems which do notenable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or thecorresponding kernel command line parameter).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-44947` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-200-generic - 5.4.0-200.220~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-200-lowlatency - 5.4.0-200.220~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1139-gcp - 5.4.0-1139.148~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-ibm - 5.4.0-1082.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
