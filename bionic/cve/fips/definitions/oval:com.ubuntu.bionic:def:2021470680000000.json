		"title": "CVE-2021-47068 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect Commits 8a4cd82d (\"nfc:fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()\") and c33b1cc62 (\"nfc: fixrefcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()\") fixed a refcount leak bug inbind/connect but introduced a use-after-free if the same local is assignedto 2 different sockets. This can be triggered by the following simpleprogram: int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP ); intsock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP ); memset( &addr,0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) ); addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP; bind( sock1, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) ) bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) ) close(sock1); close(sock2); Fixthis by assigning NULL to llcp_sock->local after callingnfc_llcp_local_put. This addresses CVE-2021-23134.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47068` to fix the vulnerability.
