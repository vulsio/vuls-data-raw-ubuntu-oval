		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ublk: detach gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() failsInside ublk_abort_requests(), gendisk is grabbed for aborting allinflight requests. And ublk_abort_requests() is called when exitingthe uring context or handling timeout.If add_disk() fails, the gendisk may have been freed when callingublk_abort_requests(), so use-after-free can be caused when gettingdisk's reference in ublk_abort_requests().Fixes the bug by detaching gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails.",
