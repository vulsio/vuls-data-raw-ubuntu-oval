		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:SUNRPC: make sure cache entry active before cache_showThe function `c_show` was called with protection from RCU. This onlyensures that `cp` will not be freed. Therefore, the reference count for`cp` can drop to zero, which will trigger a refcount use-after-freewarning when `cache_get` is called. To resolve this issue, use`cache_get_rcu` to ensure that `cp` remains active.------------[ cut here ]------------refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 822 at lib/refcount.c:25refcount_warn_saturate+0xb1/0x120CPU: 7 UID: 0 PID: 822 Comm: cat Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3+ #1Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS1.16.1-2.fc37 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xb1/0x120Call Trace: <TASK> c_show+0x2fc/0x380 [sunrpc] seq_read_iter+0x589/0x770 seq_read+0x1e5/0x270 proc_reg_read+0xe1/0x140 vfs_read+0x125/0x530 ksys_read+0xc1/0x160 do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",
