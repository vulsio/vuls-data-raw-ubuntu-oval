		"description": "Command go env is documented as outputting a shell script containing the Goenvironment. However, go env doesn't sanitize values, so executing itsoutput as a shell script can cause various bad bahaviors, includingexecuting arbitrary commands or inserting new environment variables. Thisissue is relatively minor because, in general, if an attacker can setarbitrary environment variables on a system, they have better attackvectors than making \"go env\" print them out.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-24531` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngolang-1.18 - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4+esm1\ngolang-1.18-go - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4+esm1\ngolang-1.18-src - 1.18.1-1ubuntu1~18.04.4+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
