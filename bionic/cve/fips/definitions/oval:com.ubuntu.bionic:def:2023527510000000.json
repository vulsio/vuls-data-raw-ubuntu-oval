Andbefore returning from open_cached_dir(), we put the last reference of thenew @cfid because of !@cfid->has_lease. Besides the UAF, while runningxfstests a lot of missed lease breaks have been noticed in tests that runseveral concurrent statfs(2) calls on those cached fids CIFS: VFS:\\\\w22-root1.gandalf.test No task to wake, unknown frame... CIFS: VFS:\\\\w22-root1.gandalf.test Cmd: 18 Err: 0x0 Flags: 0x1...

To fix both, in open_cached_dir() ensure that @cfid->has_leaseis set right before sending out compounded request so that any potentiallease break will be get processed by demultiplex thread while we're stillcaching @cfid. And, if open failed for some reason, re-check@cfid->has_lease to decide whether or not put lease reference.",
