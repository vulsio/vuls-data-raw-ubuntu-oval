		"description": "Xenstore: Guests can get access to Xenstore nodes of deleted domains Accessrights of Xenstore nodes are per domid. When a domain is gone, there mightbe Xenstore nodes left with access rights containing the domid of theremoved domain. This is normally no problem, as those access right entrieswill be corrected when such a node is written later. There is a small timewindow when a new domain is created, where the access rights of a pastdomain with the same domid as the new one will be regarded to be stillvalid, leading to the new domain being able to get access to a node whichwas meant to be accessible by the removed domain. For this to happenanother domain needs to write the node before the newly created domain isbeing introduced to Xenstore by dom0.",
