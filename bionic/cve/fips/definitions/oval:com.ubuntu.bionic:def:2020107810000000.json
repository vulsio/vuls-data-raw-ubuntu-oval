		"title": "CVE-2020-10781 on Ubuntu Pro FIPS 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernelmodule, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in the/dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and is not accounted fora user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With thisvulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount ofsystem memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate andterminate random userspace processes, possibly making the systeminoperable.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10781` to fix the vulnerability.
