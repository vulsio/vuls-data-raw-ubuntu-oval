		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:unicode: Fix utf8_load() error pathutf8_load() requests the symbol \"utf8_data_table\" and then checks if therequested UTF-8 version is supported. If it's unsupported, it tries toput the data table using symbol_put(). If an unsupported version isrequested, symbol_put() fails like this: kernel BUG at kernel/module/main.c:786! RIP: 0010:__symbol_put+0x93/0xb0 Call Trace:  <TASK>  ? __die_body.cold+0x19/0x27  ? die+0x2e/0x50  ? do_trap+0xca/0x110  ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80  ? __symbol_put+0x93/0xb0  ? exc_invalid_op+0x51/0x70  ? __symbol_put+0x93/0xb0  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20  ? __pfx_cmp_name+0x10/0x10  ? __symbol_put+0x93/0xb0  ? __symbol_put+0x62/0xb0  utf8_load+0xf8/0x150That happens because symbol_put() expects the unique string thatidentify the symbol, instead of a pointer to the loaded symbol. Fix thatby using such string.",
