		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: make sure to refresh master_dev/m_ops in __rtnl_newlink() Whilelooking at one unrelated syzbot bug, I found the replay logic in__rtnl_newlink() to potentially trigger use-after-free. It is better toclear master_dev and m_ops inside the loop, in case we have to replay it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48742` to fix the vulnerability.
