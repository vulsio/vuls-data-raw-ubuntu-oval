Theexecution of the two are ordered in that they are both run by the taskitself, but if io_tctx_exit_cb() is queued while we're canceling allwork items off exec AND gets executed when the task exits to userspacerather than in the main loop in io_uring_cancel_generic(), then we canfind current->io_uring == NULL and hit the above crash.It's safe to add this NULL check here, because the execution of the twopaths are done by the task itself.[axboe: add code comment and also put an explanation in the commit msg]",
