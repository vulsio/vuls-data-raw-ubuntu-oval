		"description": "** DISPUTED ** gss_mech_free in net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c inthe rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10 lackscertain domain_release calls, leading to a memory leak. Note: This wasdisputed with the assertion that the issue does not grant any access notalready available. It is a problem that on unloading a specific kernelmodule some memory is leaked, but loading kernel modules is a privilegedoperation. A user could also write a kernel module to consume any amount ofmemory they like and load that replicating the effect of this bug.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-12656` to fix the vulnerability.
