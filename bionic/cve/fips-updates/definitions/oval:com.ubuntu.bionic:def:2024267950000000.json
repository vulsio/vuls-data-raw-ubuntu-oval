		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: riscv:Sparse-Memory/vmemmap out-of-bounds fix Offset vmemmap so that the firstpage of vmemmap will be mapped to the first page of physical memory inorder to ensure that vmemmap’s bounds will be respected duringpfn_to_page()/page_to_pfn() operations. The conversion macros will producecorrect SV39/48/57 addresses for every possible/valid DRAM_BASE inside thephysical memory limits. v2:Address Alex's comments\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26795` to fix the vulnerability.
