		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Fix inversion dependency warning while enabling IPsec tunnelAttempt to enable IPsec packet offload in tunnel mode in debug kernelgenerates the following kernel panic, which is happening due to twoissues:1. In SA add section, the should be _bh() variant when marking SA mode.2. There is not needed flush_workqueue in SA delete routine. It is notneeded as at this stage as it is removed from SADB and the running workwill be canceled later in SA free. ===================================================== WARNING: SOFTIRQ-safe -> SOFTIRQ-unsafe lock order detected 6.12.0+ #4 Not tainted ----------------------------------------------------- charon/1337 [HC0[0]:SC0[4]:HE1:SE0] is trying to acquire: ffff88810f365020 (&xa->xa_lock#24){+.+.}-{3:3}, at:mlx5e_xfrm_del_state+0xca/0x1e0 [mlx5_core] and this task is already holding: ffff88813e0f0d48 (&x->lock){+.-.}-{3:3}, at: xfrm_state_delete+0x16/0x30 which would create a new lock dependency:  (&x->lock){+.-.}-{3:3} -> (&xa->xa_lock#24){+.+.}-{3:3} but this new dependency connects a SOFTIRQ-irq-safe lock:  (&x->lock){+.-.}-{3:3} ... which became SOFTIRQ-irq-safe at:   lock_acquire+0x1be/0x520   _raw_spin_lock_bh+0x34/0x40   xfrm_timer_handler+0x91/0xd70   __hrtimer_run_queues+0x1dd/0xa60   hrtimer_run_softirq+0x146/0x2e0   handle_softirqs+0x266/0x860   irq_exit_rcu+0x115/0x1a0   sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x6e/0x90   asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x16/0x20   default_idle+0x13/0x20   default_idle_call+0x67/0xa0   do_idle+0x2da/0x320   cpu_startup_entry+0x50/0x60   start_secondary+0x213/0x2a0   common_startup_64+0x129/0x138 to a SOFTIRQ-irq-unsafe lock:  (&xa->xa_lock#24){+.+.}-{3:3} ... which became SOFTIRQ-irq-unsafe at: ...   lock_acquire+0x1be/0x520   _raw_spin_lock+0x2c/0x40   xa_set_mark+0x70/0x110   mlx5e_xfrm_add_state+0xe48/0x2290 [mlx5_core]   xfrm_dev_state_add+0x3bb/0xd70   xfrm_add_sa+0x2451/0x4a90   xfrm_user_rcv_msg+0x493/0x880   netlink_rcv_skb+0x12e/0x380   xfrm_netlink_rcv+0x6d/0x90   netlink_unicast+0x42f/0x740   netlink_sendmsg+0x745/0xbe0   __sock_sendmsg+0xc5/0x190   __sys_sendto+0x1fe/0x2c0   __x64_sys_sendto+0xdc/0x1b0   do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x140   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53 other info that might help us debug this:  Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:        CPU0                    CPU1        ----                    ----   lock(&xa->xa_lock#24);                                local_irq_disable();                                lock(&x->lock);                                lock(&xa->xa_lock#24);   <Interrupt>     lock(&x->lock);  *** DEADLOCK *** 2 locks held by charon/1337:  #0: ffffffff87f8f858 (&net->xfrm.xfrm_cfg_mutex){+.+.}-{4:4}, at:xfrm_netlink_rcv+0x5e/0x90  #1: ffff88813e0f0d48 (&x->lock){+.-.}-{3:3}, at:xfrm_state_delete+0x16/0x30 the dependencies between SOFTIRQ-irq-safe lock and the holding lock: -> (&x->lock){+.-.}-{3:3} ops: 29 {    HARDIRQ-ON-W at:                     lock_acquire+0x1be/0x520                     _raw_spin_lock_bh+0x34/0x40                     xfrm_alloc_spi+0xc0/0xe60                     xfrm_alloc_userspi+0x5f6/0xbc0                     xfrm_user_rcv_msg+0x493/0x880                     netlink_rcv_skb+0x12e/0x380                     xfrm_netlink_rcv+0x6d/0x90                     netlink_unicast+0x42f/0x740                     netlink_sendmsg+0x745/0xbe0                     __sock_sendmsg+0xc5/0x190                     __sys_sendto+0x1fe/0x2c0                     __x64_sys_sendto+0xdc/0x1b0                     do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x140                     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53    IN-SOFTIRQ-W at:                     lock_acquire+0x1be/0x520                     _raw_spin_lock_bh+0x34/0x40                     xfrm_timer_handler+0x91/0xd70                     __hrtimer_run_queues+0x1dd/0xa60---truncated---",
