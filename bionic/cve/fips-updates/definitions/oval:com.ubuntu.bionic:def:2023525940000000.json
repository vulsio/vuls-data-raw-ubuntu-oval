		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:ath9k: Fix potential array-index-out-of-bounds read in ath9k_htc_txstatus()Fix an array-index-out-of-bounds read in ath9k_htc_txstatus(). The bugoccurs when txs->cnt, data from a URB provided by a USB device, is biggerthan the size of the array txs->txstatus, which is HTC_MAX_TX_STATUS.WARN_ON() already checks it, but there is no bug handling code after thecheck. Make the function return if that is the case. Found by a modifiedversion of syzkaller. UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in htc_drv_txrx.cindex 13 is out of range for type '__wmi_event_txstatus [12]' Call Trace:ath9k_htc_txstatus ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet tasklet_action_common__do_softirq irq_exit_rxu sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52594` to fix the vulnerability.
