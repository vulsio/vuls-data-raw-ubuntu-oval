		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix UAF via mismatching bpf_prog/attachment RCU flavorsUprobes always use bpf_prog_run_array_uprobe() under tasks-trace-RCUprotection. But it is possible to attach a non-sleepable BPF program to auprobe, and non-sleepable BPF programs are freed via normal RCU (see__bpf_prog_put_noref()). This leads to UAF of the bpf_prog because a normalRCU grace period does not imply a tasks-trace-RCU grace period.Fix it by explicitly waiting for a tasks-trace-RCU grace period afterremoving the attachment of a bpf_prog to a perf_event.",
