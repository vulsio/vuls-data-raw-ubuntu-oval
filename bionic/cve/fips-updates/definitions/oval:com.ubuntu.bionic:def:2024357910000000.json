		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:SVM: Flush pages under kvm->lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region() Dothe cache flush of converted pages in svm_register_enc_region() beforedropping kvm->lock to fix use-after-free issues where region and/or itsarray of pages could be freed by a different task, e.g. if userspace has__unregister_enc_region_locked() already queued up for the region. Note,the \"obvious\" alternative of using local variables doesn't fully resolvethe bug, as region->pages is also dynamically allocated. I.e. the regionstructure itself would be fine, but region->pages could be freed. Flushingmultiple pages under kvm->lock is unfortunate, but the entire flow is arare slow path, and the manual flush is only needed on CPUs that lackcoherency for encrypted memory.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35791` to fix the vulnerability.
