		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct mapReturn -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  Thisis the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4kPTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map isset up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-makesemantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly\"work\" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from thedirect map.Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systemswhere can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 withCONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n andCONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silentfailure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', mostarm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't beaffected.From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patchseries, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was theintended behavior [1] (preferred over havingset_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result inSIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped betweenv16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201124164930.GK8537@kernel.org/[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210121122723.3446-11-rppt@kernel.org/#t[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201125092208.12544-10-rppt@kernel.org/",
