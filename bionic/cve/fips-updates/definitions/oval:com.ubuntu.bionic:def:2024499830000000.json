		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: drop ppath from ext4_ext_replay_update_ex() to avoid double-freeWhen calling ext4_force_split_extent_at() in ext4_ext_replay_update_ex(),the 'ppath' is updated but it is the 'path' that is freed, thus potentiallytriggering a double-free in the following process:ext4_ext_replay_update_ex  ppath = path  ext4_force_split_extent_at(&ppath)    ext4_split_extent_at      ext4_ext_insert_extent        ext4_ext_create_new_leaf          ext4_ext_grow_indepth            ext4_find_extent              if (depth > path[0].p_maxdepth)                kfree(path)                 ---> path First freed                *orig_path = path = NULL    ---> null ppath  kfree(path)                               ---> path double-free !!!So drop the unnecessary ppath and use path directly to avoid this problem.And use ext4_find_extent() directly to update path, avoiding unnecessarymemory allocation and freeing. Also, propagate the error returned byext4_find_extent() instead of using strange error codes.",
