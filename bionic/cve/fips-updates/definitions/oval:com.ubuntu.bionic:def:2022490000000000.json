The comment ofpci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for thereturned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the inputpci_dev @from if it is not NULL.If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to callpci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. Add the missingpci_dev_put() before 'return true' to avoid reference count leak.",
