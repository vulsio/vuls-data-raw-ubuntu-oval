		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:batman-adv: Avoid WARN_ON timing related checks The soft/batadv interfacefor a queued OGM can be changed during the time the OGM was queued fortransmission and when the OGM is actually transmitted by the worker. ButWARN_ON must be used to denote kernel bugs and not to print simplewarnings. A warning can simply be printed using pr_warn.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47252` to fix the vulnerability.
