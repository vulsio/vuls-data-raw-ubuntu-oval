		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: wl128x: Fix atomicity violation in fmc_send_cmd()Atomicity violation occurs when the fmc_send_cmd() function is executedsimultaneously with the modification of the fmdev->resp_skb value.Consider a scenario where, after passing the validity check within thefunction, a non-null fmdev->resp_skb variable is assigned a null value.This results in an invalid fmdev->resp_skb variable passing the validitycheck. As seen in the later part of the function, skb = fmdev->resp_skb;when the invalid fmdev->resp_skb passes the check, a null pointerdereference error may occur at line 478, evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data;To address this issue, it is recommended to include the validity check offmdev->resp_skb within the locked section of the function. Thismodification ensures that the value of fmdev->resp_skb does not changeduring the validation process, thereby maintaining its validity.This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tooldeveloped by our team. This tool analyzes the locking APIsto extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and thenanalyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possibleconcurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations.",
