		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: m68k:Fix spinlock race in kernel thread creation Context switching does takecare to retain the correct lock owner across the switch from 'prev' to'next' tasks. This does rely on interrupts remaining disabled for theentire duration of the switch. This condition is guaranteed for normalprocess creation and context switching between already running processes,because both 'prev' and 'next' already have interrupts disabled in theirsaved copies of the status register. The situation is different for newlycreated kernel threads. The status register is set to PS_S incopy_thread(), which does leave the IPL at 0. Upon restoring the 'next'thread's status register in switch_to() aka resume(), interrupts thenbecome enabled prematurely. resume() then returns viaret_from_kernel_thread() and schedule_tail() where run queue lock isreleased (see finish_task_switch() and finish_lock_switch()). A timerinterrupt calling scheduler_tick() before the lock is released infinish_task_switch() will find the lock already taken, with the currenttask as lock owner. This causes a spinlock recursion warning as reported byGuenter Roeck. As far as I can ascertain, this race has been opened incommit 533e6903bea0 (\"m68k: split ret_from_fork(), simplifykernel_thread()\") but I haven't done a detailed study of kernel history soit may well predate that commit. Interrupts cannot be disabled in the savedstatus register copy for kernel threads (init will complain aboutinterrupts disabled when finally starting user space). Disable interruptstemporarily when switching the tasks' register sets in resume(). Note thata simple oriw 0x700,%sr after restoring sr is not enough here - this leavesenough of a race for the 'spinlock recursion' warning to still be observed.Tested on ARAnyM and qemu (Quadra 800 emulation).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38613` to fix the vulnerability.
