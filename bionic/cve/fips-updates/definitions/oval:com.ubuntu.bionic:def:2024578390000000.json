		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Revert \"readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back todo_page_cache_ra()\"This reverts commit 7c877586da3178974a8a94577b6045a48377ff25.Anders and Philippe have reported that recent kernels occasionally hangwhen used with NFS in readahead code.  The problem has been bisected to7c877586da3 (\"readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back todo_page_cache_ra()\").  The cause of the problem is that ra->size can beshrunk by read_pages() call and subsequently we end up callingdo_page_cache_ra() with negative (read huge positive) number of pages.Let's revert 7c877586da3 for now until we can find a proper way how thelogic in read_pages() and page_cache_ra_order() can coexist.  This canlead to reduced readahead throughput due to readahead window confusion butthat's better than outright hangs.",
