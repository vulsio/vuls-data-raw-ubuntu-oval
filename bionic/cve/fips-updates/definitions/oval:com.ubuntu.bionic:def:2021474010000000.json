		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipack:ipoctal: fix stack information leak The tty driver name is used also afterregistering the driver and must specifically not be allocated on the stackto avoid leaking information to user space (or triggering an oops). Driversshould not try to encode topology information in the tty device name butthis one snuck in through staging without anyone noticing and anotherdriver has since copied this malpractice. Fixing the ABI is a separateissue, but this at least plugs the security hole.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47401` to fix the vulnerability.
