		"description": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. On startup, Redisbegins listening on a Unix socket before adjusting its permissions to theuser-provided configuration. If a permissive umask(2) is used, this createsa race condition that enables, during a short period of time, anotherprocess to establish an otherwise unauthorized connection. This problem hasexisted since Redis 2.6.0-RC1. This issue has been addressed in Redisversions 7.2.2, 7.0.14 and 6.2.14. Users are advised to upgrade. For usersunable to upgrade, it is possible to work around the problem by disablingUnix sockets, starting Redis with a restrictive umask, or storing the Unixsocket file in a protected directory.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-45145` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nredis - 5:4.0.9-1ubuntu0.2+esm4\nredis-sentinel - 5:4.0.9-1ubuntu0.2+esm4\nredis-server - 5:4.0.9-1ubuntu0.2+esm4\nredis-tools - 5:4.0.9-1ubuntu0.2+esm4\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
