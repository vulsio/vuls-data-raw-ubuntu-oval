		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: correctly handle malformed BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL relosIn case of malformed relocation record of kind BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCALreferencing a non-existing BTF type, function bpf_core_calc_relo_insnwould cause a null pointer deference.Fix this by adding a proper check upper in call stack, as malformedrelocation records could be passed from user space.Simplest reproducer is a program:    r0 = 0    exitWith a single relocation record:    .insn_off = 0,          /* patch first instruction */    .type_id = 100500,      /* this type id does not exist */    .access_str_off = 6,    /* offset of string \"0\" */    .kind = BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL,See the link for original reproducer or next commit for a test case.",
