		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: serial:sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO TheSC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the initialregister address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data withouthaving to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the ICdoesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte. Theregmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can perform IOover multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write from/to theFIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on the SPIbus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled manually.The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these functionsassume that the register address is incremented and handle the cacheaccordingly. Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versionsin order to remove the manual cache control which was a workaround whenusing the _raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatileso cache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52488` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-202-generic - 5.4.0-202.222~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-202-lowlatency - 5.4.0-202.222~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1136-aws - 5.4.0-1136.146~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1142-azure - 5.4.0-1142.149~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1140-gcp - 5.4.0-1140.149~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1083-ibm - 5.4.0-1083.88~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1135-oracle - 5.4.0-1135.144~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1120-raspi - 5.4.0-1120.132~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
