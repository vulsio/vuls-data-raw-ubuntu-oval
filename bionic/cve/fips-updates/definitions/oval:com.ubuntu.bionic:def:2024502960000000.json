		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: hns3: fix kernel crash when uninstalling driverWhen the driver is uninstalled and the VF is disabled concurrently, akernel crash occurs. The reason is that the two actions call functionpci_disable_sriov(). The num_VFs is checked to determine whether torelease the corresponding resources. During the second calling, num_VFsis not 0 and the resource release function is called. However, thecorresponding resource has been released during the first invoking.Therefore, the problem occurs:[15277.839633][T50670] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference atvirtual address 0000000000000020...[15278.131557][T50670] Call trace:[15278.134686][T50670]  klist_put+0x28/0x12c[15278.138682][T50670]  klist_del+0x14/0x20[15278.142592][T50670]  device_del+0xbc/0x3c0[15278.146676][T50670]  pci_remove_bus_device+0x84/0x120[15278.151714][T50670]  pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device+0x6c/0x80[15278.157447][T50670]  pci_iov_remove_virtfn+0xb4/0x12c[15278.162485][T50670]  sriov_disable+0x50/0x11c[15278.166829][T50670]  pci_disable_sriov+0x24/0x30[15278.171433][T50670]  hnae3_unregister_ae_algo_prepare+0x60/0x90 [hnae3][15278.178039][T50670]  hclge_exit+0x28/0xd0 [hclge][15278.182730][T50670]  __se_sys_delete_module.isra.0+0x164/0x230[15278.188550][T50670]  __arm64_sys_delete_module+0x1c/0x30[15278.193848][T50670]  invoke_syscall+0x50/0x11c[15278.198278][T50670]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x158/0x164[15278.203837][T50670]  do_el0_svc+0x34/0xcc[15278.207834][T50670]  el0_svc+0x20/0x30For details, see the following figure.     rmmod hclge              disable VFs----------------------------------------------------hclge_exit()            sriov_numvfs_store()  ...                     device_lock()  pci_disable_sriov()     hns3_pci_sriov_configure()                            pci_disable_sriov()                              sriov_disable()    sriov_disable()             if !num_VFs :      if !num_VFs :               return;        return;                 sriov_del_vfs()      sriov_del_vfs()             ...        ...                       klist_put()        klist_put()               ...        ...                     num_VFs = 0;      num_VFs = 0;        device_unlock();In this patch, when driver is removing, we get the device_lock()to protect num_VFs, just like sriov_numvfs_store().",
