		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fbdev:sis: Error out if pixclock equals zero The userspace program could pass anyvalues to the driver through ioctl() interface. If the driver doesn't checkthe value of pixclock, it may cause divide-by-zero error. Insisfb_check_var(), var->pixclock is used as a divisor to caculate dratebefore it is checked against zero. Fix this by checking it at thebeginning. This is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed bycommit 15cf0b8.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26777` to fix the vulnerability.
