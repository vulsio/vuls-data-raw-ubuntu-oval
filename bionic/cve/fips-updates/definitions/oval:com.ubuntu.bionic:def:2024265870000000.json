		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:netdevsim: don't try to destroy PHC on VFs PHC gets initialized innsim_init_netdevsim(), which is only called if (nsim_dev_port_is_pf()).Create a counterpart of nsim_init_netdevsim() and move themock_phc_destroy() there. This fixes a crash trying to destroy netdevsimwith VFs instantiated, as caught by running the devlink.sh test: BUG:kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000b8 RIP:0010:mock_phc_destroy+0xd/0x30 Call Trace: <TASK> nsim_destroy+0x4a/0x70[netdevsim] __nsim_dev_port_del+0x47/0x70 [netdevsim]nsim_dev_reload_destroy+0x105/0x120 [netdevsim] nsim_drv_remove+0x2f/0xb0[netdevsim] device_release_driver_internal+0x1a1/0x210bus_remove_device+0xd5/0x120 device_del+0x159/0x490device_unregister+0x12/0x30 del_device_store+0x11a/0x1a0 [netdevsim]kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x130/0x1d0 vfs_write+0x30b/0x4b0ksys_write+0x69/0xf0 do_syscall_64+0xcc/0x1e0entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6f/0x77\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26587` to fix the vulnerability.
