The issue could occur when the index 'i' exceeds thenumber of transfer function points (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS).The fix adds a check to ensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing thetransfer function points. If 'i' is out of bounds, the function returnsfalse to indicate an error.drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn30/dcn30_cm_common.c:180cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.red' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn30/dcn30_cm_common.c:181cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.green' 1025 <= s32maxdrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn30/dcn30_cm_common.c:182cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format() error: buffer overflow'output_tf->tf_pts.blue' 1025 <= s32max",
