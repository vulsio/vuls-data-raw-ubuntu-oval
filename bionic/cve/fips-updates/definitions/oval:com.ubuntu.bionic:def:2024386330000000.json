		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: serial:max3100: Update uart_driver_registered on driver removal The removal of thelast MAX3100 device triggers the removal of the driver. However, codedoesn't update the respective global variable and after insmod — rmmod —insmod cycle the kernel oopses: max3100 spi-PRP0001:01: max3100_probe:adding port 0 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:0000000000000408 ... RIP: 0010:serial_core_register_port+0xa0/0x840 ...max3100_probe+0x1b6/0x280 [max3100] spi_probe+0x8d/0xb0 Update the actualstate so next time UART driver will be registered again. Hugo also noticed,that the error path in the probe also affected by having the variable set,and not cleared. Instead of clearing it move the assignment after thesuccessfull uart_register_driver() call.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38633` to fix the vulnerability.
