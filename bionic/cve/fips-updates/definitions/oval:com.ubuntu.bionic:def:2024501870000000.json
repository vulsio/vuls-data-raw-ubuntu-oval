		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vc4: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyedUpon closing the file descriptor, the active performance monitor is notstopped. Although all perfmons are destroyed in `vc4_perfmon_close_file()`,the active performance monitor's pointer (`vc4->active_perfmon`) is stillretained.If we open a new file descriptor and submit a few jobs with performancemonitors, the driver will attempt to stop the active performance monitorusing the stale pointer in `vc4->active_perfmon`. However, this pointeris no longer valid because the previous process has already terminated,and all performance monitors associated with it have been destroyed andfreed.To fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a givenprocess, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50187` to fix the vulnerability.
