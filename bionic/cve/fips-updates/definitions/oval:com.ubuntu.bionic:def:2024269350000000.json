		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression Commit fc663711b944(\"scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name} directory earlier\") fixeda bug related to modules loading/unloading, by adding a call toscsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led to a potentialduplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also called fromscsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report, which was thenfixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (\"scsi: core: Fix a procfs host directoryremoval regression\"). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call fromdev_release(). But it happens that this proc directory is created onscsi_host_alloc(), and that function \"pairs\" with scsi_host_dev_release(),while scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, itseems the reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meantto cover cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the callto scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in someerror paths, for example. Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadgetdevice, error'ing on usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checkingthat path, we can see that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put()after a SCSI host allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() insuch path. That leads to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of theSCSI host proc structure): usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage devicedetected proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered WARNING: CPU:1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0fs/proc/generic.c:376 The proper fix seems to still callscsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(), but guard that with the statecheck for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a comment in scsi_host_dev_release()detailing that: such conditional is meant for cases where the SCSI host wasallocated but there was no calls to {add,remove}_host(), like theusb-storage case. This is what we propose here and with that, the errorpath of usb-storage does not trigger the warning anymore.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26935` to fix the vulnerability.
