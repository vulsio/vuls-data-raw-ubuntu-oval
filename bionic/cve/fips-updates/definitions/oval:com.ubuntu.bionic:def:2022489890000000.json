		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fscache: Fix oops due to race with cookie_lru and use_cookieIf a cookie expires from the LRU and the LRU_DISCARD flag is set, butthe state machine has not run yet, it's possible another thread can callfscache_use_cookie and begin to use it.When the cookie_worker finally runs, it will see the LRU_DISCARD flagset, transition the cookie->state to LRU_DISCARDING, which will thenwithdraw the cookie.  Once the cookie is withdrawn the object is removedthe below oops will occur because the object associated with the cookieis now NULL.Fix the oops by clearing the LRU_DISCARD bit if another thread uses thecookie before the cookie_worker runs.
