		"description": "To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS)to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature calledupdate-policy. Various rules can be configured to limit the types ofupdates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used whensending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were notinitially documented, and when documentation for them was added to theAdministrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that wasadded to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of tworule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentationcould mislead operators into believing that policies they had configuredwere more restrictive than they actually were. This affects BIND versionsprior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3.",
