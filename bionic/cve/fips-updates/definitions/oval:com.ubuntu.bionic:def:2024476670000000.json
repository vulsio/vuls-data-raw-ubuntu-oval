		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: keystone: Add workaround for Errata #i2037 (AM65x SR 1.0)Errata #i2037 in AM65x/DRA80xM Processors Silicon Revision 1.0(SPRZ452D_July 2018_Revised December 2019 [1]) mentions when aninbound PCIe TLP spans more than two internal AXI 128-byte bursts,the bus may corrupt the packet payload and the corrupt data maycause associated applications or the processor to hang.The workaround for Errata #i2037 is to limit the maximum readrequest size and maximum payload size to 128 bytes. Add workaroundfor Errata #i2037 here.The errata and workaround is applicable only to AM65x SR 1.0 andlater versions of the silicon will have this fixed.[1] -> https://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz452i/sprz452i.pdf",
