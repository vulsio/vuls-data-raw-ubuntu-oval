		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ravb:Fix use-after-free issue in ravb_tx_timeout_work() The ravb_stop() shouldcall cancel_work_sync(). Otherwise, ravb_tx_timeout_work() is possible touse the freed priv after ravb_remove() was called like below: CPU0 CPU1ravb_tx_timeout() ravb_remove() unregister_netdev() free_netdev(ndev) //free priv ravb_tx_timeout_work() // use priv unregister_netdev() will call.ndo_stop() so that ravb_stop() is called. And, after phy_stop() is called,netif_carrier_off() is also called. So that .ndo_tx_timeout() will not becalled after phy_stop().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52509` to fix the vulnerability.
