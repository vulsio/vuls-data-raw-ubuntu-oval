		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu/fence: Fix oops due to non-matching drm_sched init/finiCurrently amdgpu calls drm_sched_fini() from the fence driver sw finiroutine - such function is expected to be called only after the respectiveinit function - drm_sched_init() - was executed successfully. Happens thatwe faced a driver probe failure in the Steam Deck recently, and thefunction drm_sched_fini() was called even without its counter-part had beenpreviously called, causing the following oops: amdgpu: probe of0000:04:00.0 failed with error -110 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference,address: 0000000000000090 PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTICPU: 0 PID: 609 Comm: systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.2.0-rc3-gpiccoli #338Hardware name: Valve Jupiter/Jupiter, BIOS F7A0113 11/04/2022 RIP:0010:drm_sched_fini+0x84/0xa0 [gpu_sched] [...] Call Trace: <TASK>amdgpu_fence_driver_sw_fini+0xc8/0xd0 [amdgpu]amdgpu_device_fini_sw+0x2b/0x3b0 [amdgpu]amdgpu_driver_release_kms+0x16/0x30 [amdgpu]devm_drm_dev_init_release+0x49/0x70 [...] To prevent that, check if thedrm_sched was properly initialized for a given ring before calling its finicounter-part. Notice ideally we'd use sched.ready for that; such field isset as the latest thing on drm_sched_init(). But amdgpu seems to \"override\"the meaning of such field - in the above oops for example, it was a GFXring causing the crash, and the sched.ready field was set to true in thering init routine, regardless of the state of the DRM scheduler. Hence, weended-up using sched.ops as per Christian's suggestion [0], and alsoremoved the no_scheduler check [1].
