		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: PM /devfreq: Fix buffer overflow in trans_stat_show Fix buffer overflow intrans_stat_show(). Convert simple snprintf to the more secure scnprintfwith size of PAGE_SIZE. Add condition checking if we are exceedingPAGE_SIZE and exit early from loop. Also add at the end a warning that weexceeded PAGE_SIZE and that stats is disabled. Return -EFBIG in the casewhere we don't have enough space to write the full transition table.
