		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: mdio: fix unbalanced fwnode reference count in mdio_device_release()There is warning report about of_node refcount leakwhile probing mdio device:OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:attach overlay node /spi/soc@0/mdio@710700c0/ethernet@4In of_mdiobus_register_device(), we increase fwnode refcountby fwnode_handle_get() before associating the of_node withmdio device, but it has never been decreased in normal path.Since that, in mdio_device_release(), it needs to callfwnode_handle_put() in addition instead of calling kfree()directly.After above, just calling mdio_device_free() in the error handlepath of of_mdiobus_register_device() is enough to keep therefcount balanced.",
