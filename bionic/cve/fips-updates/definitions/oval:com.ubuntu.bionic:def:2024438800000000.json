		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix object nesting warningACLs in Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs can reside in the algorithmic TCAM(A-TCAM) or in the ordinary circuit TCAM (C-TCAM). The former cancontain more ACLs (i.e., tc filters), but the number of masks in eachregion (i.e., tc chain) is limited.In order to mitigate the effects of the above limitation, the deviceallows filters to share a single mask if their masks only differ in upto 8 consecutive bits. For example, dst_ip/25 can be represented usingdst_ip/24 with a delta of 1 bit. The C-TCAM does not have a limit on thenumber of masks being used (and therefore does not support maskaggregation), but can contain a limited number of filters.The driver uses the \"objagg\" library to perform the mask aggregation bypassing it objects that consist of the filter's mask and whether thefilter is to be inserted into the A-TCAM or the C-TCAM since filters indifferent TCAMs cannot share a mask.The set of created objects is dependent on the insertion order of thefilters and is not necessarily optimal. Therefore, the driver willperiodically ask the library to compute a more optimal set (\"hints\") bylooking at all the existing objects.When the library asks the driver whether two objects can be aggregatedthe driver only compares the provided masks and ignores the A-TCAM /C-TCAM indication. This is the right thing to do since the goal is tomove as many filters as possible to the A-TCAM. The driver also forbidstwo identical masks from being aggregated since this can only happen ifone was intentionally put in the C-TCAM to avoid a conflict in theA-TCAM.The above can result in the following set of hints:H1: {mask X, A-TCAM} -> H2: {mask Y, A-TCAM} // X is Y + deltaH3: {mask Y, C-TCAM} -> H4: {mask Z, A-TCAM} // Y is Z + deltaAfter getting the hints from the library the driver will start migratingfilters from one region to another while consulting the computed hintsand instructing the device to perform a lookup in both regions duringthe transition.Assuming a filter with mask X is being migrated into the A-TCAM in thenew region, the hints lookup will return H1. Since H2 is the parent ofH1, the library will try to find the object associated with it andcreate it if necessary in which case another hints lookup (recursive)will be performed. This hints lookup for {mask Y, A-TCAM} will eitherreturn H2 or H3 since the driver passes the library an object comparisonfunction that ignores the A-TCAM / C-TCAM indication.This can eventually lead to nested objects which are not supported bythe library [1].Fix by removing the object comparison function from both the driver andthe library as the driver was the only user. That way the lookup willonly return exact matches.I do not have a reliable reproducer that can reproduce the issue in atimely manner, but before the fix the issue would reproduce in severalminutes and with the fix it does not reproduce in over an hour.Note that the current usefulness of the hints is limited because theyinclude the C-TCAM indication and represent aggregation that cannotactually happen. This will be addressed in net-next.[1]WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 153 at lib/objagg.c:170objagg_obj_parent_assign+0xb5/0xd0Modules linked in:CPU: 0 PID: 153 Comm: kworker/0:18 Not tainted6.9.0-rc6-custom-g70fbc2c1c38b #42Hardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
