		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/64s: fix program check interrupt emergency stack path Emergencystack path was jumping into a 3: label inside the __GEN_COMMON_BODY macrofor the normal path after it had finished, rather than jumping over it. Bya small miracle this is the correct place to build up a new interrupt framewith the existing stack pointer, so things basically worked okay with anadded weird looking 700 trap frame on top (which had the wrong ->nip so itdidn't decode bug messages either). Fix this by avoiding using numericlabels when jumping over non-trivial macros.
