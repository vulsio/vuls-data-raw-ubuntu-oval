		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:x86: Forcibly leave nested virt when SMM state is toggled Forcibly leavenested virtualization operation if userspace toggles SMM state viaKVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS or KVM_SYNC_X86_EVENTS. If userspace forces the vCPUout of SMM while it's post-VMXON and then injects an SMI, vmx_enter_smm()will overwrite vmx->nested.smm.vmxon and end up with both vmxon=false andsmm.vmxon=false, but all other nVMX state allocated. Don't attempt togracefully handle the transition as (a) most transitions are nonsencial,e.g. forcing SMM while L2 is running, (b) there isn't sufficientinformation to handle all transitions, e.g. SVM wants access to the SMRAMsave state, and (c) KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS must precede KVM_SET_NESTED_STATEduring state restore as the latter disallows putting the vCPU into L2 ifSMM is active, and disallows tagging the vCPU as being post-VMXON in SMM ifSMM is not active. Abuse of KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS manifests as a WARN andmemory leak in nVMX due to failure to free vmcs01's shadow VMCS, but thebug goes far beyond just a memory leak, e.g. toggling SMM on while L2 isactive puts the vCPU in an architecturally impossible state.
