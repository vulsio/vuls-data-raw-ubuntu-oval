		"description": "The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such thatsubsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values. Thisinitialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwritepointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would resultin leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaningup after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. AllLinux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28688` to fix the vulnerability.
