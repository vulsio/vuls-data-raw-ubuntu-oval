		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()There is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC ons390. Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON indo_exception().However, since commit af19487f00f3 (\"mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR moregeneral\"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination withPTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISONotherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().Fix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similarto x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected faultflags, for easier debugging.Note that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannotsupport swap entries on other levels than PTE level.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41021` to fix the vulnerability.
