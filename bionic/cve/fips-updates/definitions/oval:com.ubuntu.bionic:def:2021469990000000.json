		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sctp:do asoc update earlier in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a There's a panic that occursin a few of envs, the call trace is as below: [] general protection fault,... 0x29acd70f1000a: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI [] RIP:0010:sctp_ulpevent_notify_peer_addr_change+0x4b/0x1fa [sctp] []sctp_assoc_control_transport+0x1b9/0x210 [sctp] []sctp_do_8_2_transport_strike.isra.16+0x15c/0x220 [sctp] []sctp_cmd_interpreter.isra.21+0x1231/0x1a10 [sctp] [] sctp_do_sm+0xc3/0x2a0[sctp] [] sctp_generate_timeout_event+0x81/0xf0 [sctp] This is caused by atransport use-after-free issue. When processing a duplicate COOKIE-ECHOchunk in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), both COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks areallocated with the transort from the new asoc. However, later in thesideeffect machine, the old asoc is used to send them out and old asoc'sshutdown_last_sent_to is set to the transport that SHUTDOWN chunk attachedto in sctp_cmd_setup_t2(), which actually belongs to the new asoc. Afterthe new_asoc is freed and the old asoc T2 timeout, the old asoc'sshutdown_last_sent_to that is already freed would be accessed insctp_sf_t2_timer_expire(). Thanks Alexander and Jere for helping dig intothis issue. To fix it, this patch is to do the asoc update first, thenallocate the COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks with the 'updated' old asoc.This would make more sense, as a chunk from an asoc shouldn't be sent outwith another asoc. We had fixed quite a few issues caused by this.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46999` to fix the vulnerability.
