		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooksbpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functionscan take different parameters or return different return values. Ifprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to anotherkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could bebypassed.For example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameterand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifierassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2'sprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter fromthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not preventprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,that is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.Another example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,and BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifierknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal forbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegalfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allowsprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to returnpositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1from calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1will be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.That is, the return value rule is bypassed.This patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.",
