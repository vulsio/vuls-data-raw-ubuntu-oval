		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Update error handler for UCTX and UMEM In the fast unload flow,the device state is set to internal error, which indicates that the driverstarted the destroy process. In this case, when a destroy command is beingexecuted, it should return MLX5_CMD_STAT_OK. Fix MLX5_CMD_OP_DESTROY_UCTXand MLX5_CMD_OP_DESTROY_UMEM to return OK instead of EIO. This fixes a calltrace in the umem release process - [ 2633.536695] Call Trace: [2633.537518] ib_uverbs_remove_one+0xc3/0x140 [ib_uverbs] [ 2633.538596]remove_client_context+0x8b/0xd0 [ib_core] [ 2633.539641]disable_device+0x8c/0x130 [ib_core] [ 2633.540615]__ib_unregister_device+0x35/0xa0 [ib_core] [ 2633.541640]ib_unregister_device+0x21/0x30 [ib_core] [ 2633.542663]__mlx5_ib_remove+0x38/0x90 [mlx5_ib] [ 2633.543640]auxiliary_bus_remove+0x1e/0x30 [auxiliary] [ 2633.544661]device_release_driver_internal+0x103/0x1f0 [ 2633.545679]bus_remove_device+0xf7/0x170 [ 2633.546640] device_del+0x181/0x410 [2633.547606] mlx5_rescan_drivers_locked.part.10+0x63/0x160 [mlx5_core] [2633.548777] mlx5_unregister_device+0x27/0x40 [mlx5_core] [ 2633.549841]mlx5_uninit_one+0x21/0xc0 [mlx5_core] [ 2633.550864] remove_one+0x69/0xe0[mlx5_core] [ 2633.551819] pci_device_remove+0x3b/0xc0 [ 2633.552731]device_release_driver_internal+0x103/0x1f0 [ 2633.553746]unbind_store+0xf6/0x130 [ 2633.554657] kernfs_fop_write+0x116/0x190 [2633.555567] vfs_write+0xa5/0x1a0 [ 2633.556407] ksys_write+0x4f/0xb0 [2633.557233] do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x1a0 [ 2633.558071]entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x65/0xca [ 2633.559018] RIP:0033:0x7f9977132648 [ 2633.559821] Code: 89 02 48 c7 c0 ff ff ff ff eb b30f 1f 80 00 00 00 00 f3 0f 1e fa 48 8d 05 55 6f 2d 00 8b 00 85 c0 75 17 b801 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 58 c3 0f 1f 80 00 00 00 00 41 5449 89 d4 55 [ 2633.562332] RSP: 002b:00007fffb1a83888 EFLAGS: 00000246ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001 [ 2633.563472] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX:000000000000000c RCX: 00007f9977132648 [ 2633.564541] RDX: 000000000000000cRSI: 000055b90546e230 RDI: 0000000000000001 [ 2633.565596] RBP:000055b90546e230 R08: 00007f9977406860 R09: 00007f9977a54740 [ 2633.566653]R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f99774056e0 [2633.567692] R13: 000000000000000c R14: 00007f9977400880 R15:000000000000000c [ 2633.568725] ---[ end trace 10b4fe52945e544d ]---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47212` to fix the vulnerability.
