		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: eth:sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks Erhard reportsnetpoll warnings from sungem: netpoll_send_skb_on_dev(): eth0 enabledinterrupts in poll (gem_start_xmit+0x0/0x398) WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 atnet/core/netpoll.c:370 netpoll_send_skb+0x1fc/0x20c gem_poll_controller()disables interrupts, which may sleep. We can't sleep in netpoll, it hasinterrupts disabled completely. Strangely, gem_poll_controller() doesn'teven poll the completions, and instead acts as if an interrupt has fired soit just schedules NAPI and exits. None of this has been necessary foryears, since netpoll invokes NAPI directly.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38597` to fix the vulnerability.
