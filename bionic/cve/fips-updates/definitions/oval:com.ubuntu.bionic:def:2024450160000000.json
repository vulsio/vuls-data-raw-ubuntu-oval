		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue failsThere is a bug in netem_enqueue() introduced bycommit 5845f706388a (\"net: netem: fix skb length BUG_ON in __skb_to_sgvec\")that can lead to a use-after-free.This commit made netem_enqueue() always return NET_XMIT_SUCCESSwhen a packet is duplicated, which can cause the parent qdisc's q.qlento be mistakenly incremented. When this happens qlen_notify() may beskipped on the parent during destruction, leaving a dangling pointerfor some classful qdiscs like DRR.There are two ways for the bug happen:- If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq->enqueue() and then  the original packet is also dropped.- If rootq->enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc  and the original packet is dropped.In both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packetsare enqueued at the netem qdisc.The fix is to defer the enqueue of the duplicate packet until afterthe original packet has been guaranteed to return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS.",
