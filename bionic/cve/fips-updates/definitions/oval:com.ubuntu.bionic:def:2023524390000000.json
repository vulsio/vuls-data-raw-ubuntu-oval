		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: uio:Fix use-after-free in uio_open core-1 core-2-------------------------------------------------------uio_unregister_device uio_open idev = idr_find()device_unregister(&idev->dev) put_device(&idev->dev) uio_device_releaseget_device(&idev->dev) kfree(idev) uio_free_minor(minor) uio_releaseput_device(&idev->dev) kfree(idev)------------------------------------------------------- In the core-1uio_unregister_device(), the device_unregister will kfree idev when theidev->dev kobject ref is 1. But after core-1 device_unregister, put_deviceand before doing kfree, the core-2 may get_device. Then: 1. After core-1kfree idev, the core-2 will do use-after-free for idev. 2. When core-2 douio_release and put_device, the idev will be double freed. To address thisissue, we can get idev atomic & inc idev reference with minor_lock.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52439` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-225-generic - 4.15.0-225.237\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-225-generic - 4.15.0-225.237\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-225-lowlatency - 4.15.0-225.237\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1152-kvm - 4.15.0-1152.157\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-aws - 4.15.0-1168.181\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1177-azure - 4.15.0-1177.192\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-gcp - 4.15.0-1162.179\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-oracle - 4.15.0-1131.142\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
