		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:device-dax: correct pgoff align in dax_set_mapping()pgoff should be aligned using ALIGN_DOWN() instead of ALIGN().  Otherwise,vmf->address not aligned to fault_size will be aligned to the nextalignment, that can result in memory failure getting the wrong address.It's a subtle situation that only can be observed inpage_mapped_in_vma() after the page is page fault handled bydev_dax_huge_fault.  Generally, there is little chance to performpage_mapped_in_vma in dev-dax's page unless in specific error injectionto the dax device to trigger an MCE - memory-failure.  In that case,page_mapped_in_vma() will be triggered to determine which task isaccessing the failure address and kill that task in the end.We used self-developed dax device (which is 2M aligned mapping) , toperform error injection to random address.  It turned out that errorinjected to non-2M-aligned address was causing endless MCE until panic.Because page_mapped_in_vma() kept resulting wrong address and the taskaccessing the failure address was never killed properly:[ 3783.719419] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3784.049006] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3784.049190] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3784.448042] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3784.448186] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3784.792026] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3784.792179] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3785.162502] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3785.162633] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3785.461116] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3785.461247] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3785.764730] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3785.764859] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3786.042128] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3786.042259] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3786.464293] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3786.464423] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3786.818090] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3786.818217] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:Recovered[ 3787.085297] mce: Uncorrected hardware memory error in user-access at200c9742380[ 3787.085424] Memory failure: 0x200c9742: recovery action for dax page:RecoveredIt took us several weeks to pinpoint this problem,Â  but we eventuallyused bpftrace to trace the page fault and mce address and successfullyidentified the issue.Joao added:; Likely we never reproduce in production because we always pin: device-dax regions in the region align they provide (Qemu does: similarly with prealloc in hugetlb/file backed memory).  I think this: bug requires that we touch *unpinned* device-dax regions unaligned to: the device-dax selected alignment (page size i.e.  4K/2M/1G)",
