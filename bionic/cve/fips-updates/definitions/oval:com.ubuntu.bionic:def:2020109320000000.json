		"description": "An issue was discovered in Arm Mbed TLS before 2.16.6 and 2.7.x before2.7.15. An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel measurementscan recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing theprojective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by exploitingside channels in the conversion to affine coordinates; (2) using an attackdescribed by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits ofthe ephemeral scalar from those projective coordinates via severalmeasurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from there to thelong-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attackerwould have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controllingthe untrusted OS.",
