		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial/pmac_zilog: Remove flawed mitigation for rx irq flood The mitigationwas intended to stop the irq completely. That may be better than a hardlock-up but it turns out that you get a crash anyway if you're usingpmac_zilog as a serial console: ttyPZ0: pmz: rx irq flood ! BUG: spinlockrecursion on CPU#0, swapper/0 That's because the pr_err() call inpmz_receive_chars() results in pmz_console_write() attempting to lock aspinlock already locked in pmz_interrupt(). With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y,this produces a fatal BUG splat. The spinlock in question is the one instruct uart_port. Even when it's not fatal, the serial port rx functionceases to work. Also, the iteration limit doesn't play nicely with QEMU, ascan be seen in the bug report linked below. A web search for other reportsof the error message \"pmz: rx irq flood\" didn't produce anything. So Idon't think this code is needed any more. Remove it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26999` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-generic - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-189-lowlatency - 5.4.0-189.209~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1133-azure - 5.4.0-1133.140~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1132-gcp - 5.4.0-1132.141~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1075-ibm - 5.4.0-1075.80~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1127-oracle - 5.4.0-1127.136~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
