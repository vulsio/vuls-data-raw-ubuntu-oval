		"description": "The NPM package `micromatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial ofService (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in`index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. Bypassing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking tothe input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input sizeincreases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes theapplication to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but furthertesting shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using asafe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due togreedy matching.",
