		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bonding: Fix unnecessary warnings and logs from bond_xdp_get_xmit_slave()syzbot reported a WARNING in bond_xdp_get_xmit_slave. To reproducethis[1], one bond device (bond1) has xdpdrv, which increasesbpf_master_redirect_enabled_key. Another bond device (bond0) which isunsupported by XDP but its slave (veth3) has xdpgeneric that returnsXDP_TX. This triggers WARN_ON_ONCE() from the xdp_master_redirect().To reduce unnecessary warnings and improve log management, we need todelete the WARN_ON_ONCE() and add ratelimit to the netdev_err().[1] Steps to reproduce:    # Needs tx_xdp with return XDP_TX;    ip l add veth0 type veth peer veth1    ip l add veth3 type veth peer veth4    ip l add bond0 type bond mode 6 # BOND_MODE_ALB, unsupported by XDP    ip l add bond1 type bond # BOND_MODE_ROUNDROBIN by default    ip l set veth0 master bond1    ip l set bond1 up    # Increases bpf_master_redirect_enabled_key    ip l set dev bond1 xdpdrv object tx_xdp.o section xdp_tx    ip l set veth3 master bond0    ip l set bond0 up    ip l set veth4 up    # Triggers WARN_ON_ONCE() from the xdp_master_redirect()    ip l set veth3 xdpgeneric object tx_xdp.o section xdp_tx",
