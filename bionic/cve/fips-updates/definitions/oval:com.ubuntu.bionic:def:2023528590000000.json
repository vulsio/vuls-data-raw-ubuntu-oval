		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: perf:hisi: Fix use-after-free when register pmu fails When we fail to registerthe uncore pmu, the pmu context may not been allocated. The error handingwill call cpuhp_state_remove_instance() to call uncore pmu offlinecallback, which migrate the pmu context. Since that's liable to lead tosome kind of use-after-free. Use cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls()instead of cpuhp_state_remove_instance() so that the notifiers don'texecute after the PMU device has been failed to register.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52859` to fix the vulnerability.
