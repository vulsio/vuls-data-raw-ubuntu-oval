		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slub: avoid zeroing outside-object freepointer for single free Commit284f17ac13fe (\"mm/slub: handle bulk and single object freeing separately\")splits single and bulk object freeing in two functions slab_free() andslab_free_bulk() which leads slab_free() to call slab_free_hook() directlyinstead of slab_free_freelist_hook(). If `init_on_free` is set,slab_free_hook() zeroes the object. Afterward, if `slub_debug=F` and`CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED` are set, the do_slab_free() slowpathexecutes freelist consistency checks and try to decode a zeroed freepointerwhich leads to a \"Freepointer corrupt\" detection in check_object(). Duringbulk free, slab_free_freelist_hook() isn't affected as it always sets itobjects freepointer using set_freepointer() to maintain its reconstructedfreelist after `init_on_free`. For single free, object's freepointer thusneeds to be avoided when stored outside the object if `init_on_free` isset. The freepointer left as is, check_object() may later detect an invalidpointer value due to objects overflow. To reproduce, set `slub_debug=FUinit_on_free=1 log_level=7` on the command line of a kernel build with`CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED=y`. dmesg sample log: [ 10.708715]=============================================================================[ 10.710323] BUG kmalloc-rnd-05-32 (Tainted: G B T ): Freepointer corrupt [10.712695]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[ 10.712695] [ 10.712695] Slab 0xffffd8bdc400d580 objects=32 used=4fp=0xffff9d9a80356f80flags=0x200000000000a00(workingset|slab|node=0|zone=2) [ 10.716698] Object0xffff9d9a80356600 @offset=1536 fp=0x7ee4f480ce0ecd7c [ 10.716698] [10.716698] Bytes b4 ffff9d9a803565f0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0000 00 00 00 ................
