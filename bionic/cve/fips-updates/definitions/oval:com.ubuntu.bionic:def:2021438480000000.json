		"description": "h2o is an open source http server. In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commith2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC framesin certain order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguidedto treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received.When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse thisvulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlledby the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint thatreflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use thatreflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includestraffic of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets.This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between commit93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the released versions of h2o are affected bythis vulnerability. There are no known workarounds. Users of unreleasedversions of h2o using HTTP/3 are advised to upgrade immediately.",
