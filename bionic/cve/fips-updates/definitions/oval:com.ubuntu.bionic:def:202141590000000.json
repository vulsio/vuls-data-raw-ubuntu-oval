		"description": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's EBPF verifier when handlinginternal data structures. Internal memory locations could be returned touserspace. A local attacker with the permissions to insert eBPF code to thekernel can use this to leak internal kernel memory details defeating someof the exploit mitigations in place for the kernel.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4159` to fix the vulnerability.
