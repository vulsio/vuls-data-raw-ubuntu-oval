		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assemblingWhen CXL subsystem is auto-assembling a pmem region during cxlendpoint port probing, always hit below calltrace. BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000078 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page RIP: 0010:cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem] Call Trace:  <TASK>  ? __die+0x24/0x70  ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160  ? do_user_addr_fault+0x65/0x6b0  ? exc_page_fault+0x7d/0x170  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30  ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]  ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x1ac/0x360 [cxl_pmem]  cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]  really_probe+0x173/0x410  ? __pfx___device_attach_driver+0x10/0x10  __driver_probe_device+0x80/0x170  driver_probe_device+0x1e/0x90  __device_attach_driver+0x90/0x120  bus_for_each_drv+0x84/0xe0  __device_attach+0xbc/0x1f0  bus_probe_device+0x90/0xa0  device_add+0x51c/0x710  devm_cxl_add_pmem_region+0x1b5/0x380 [cxl_core]  cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]The cxl_nvd of the memdev needs to be available during the pmem regionprobe. Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe.The endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause apmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust thesequence so this dependency is met.This requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() thatcan be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is notyet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, sostart the query from there instead.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41085` to fix the vulnerability.
