		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:f2fs: fix to do sanity check on F2FS_INLINE_DATA flag in inode during GCsyzbot reports a f2fs bug as below:------------[ cut here ]------------kernel BUG at fs/f2fs/inline.c:258!CPU: 1 PID: 34 Comm: kworker/u8:2 Not tainted6.9.0-rc6-syzkaller-00012-g9e4bc4bcae01 #0RIP: 0010:f2fs_write_inline_data+0x781/0x790 fs/f2fs/inline.c:258Call Trace: f2fs_write_single_data_page+0xb65/0x1d60 fs/f2fs/data.c:2834 f2fs_write_cache_pages fs/f2fs/data.c:3133 [inline] __f2fs_write_data_pages fs/f2fs/data.c:3288 [inline] f2fs_write_data_pages+0x1efe/0x3a90 fs/f2fs/data.c:3315 do_writepages+0x35b/0x870 mm/page-writeback.c:2612 __writeback_single_inode+0x165/0x10b0 fs/fs-writeback.c:1650 writeback_sb_inodes+0x905/0x1260 fs/fs-writeback.c:1941 wb_writeback+0x457/0xce0 fs/fs-writeback.c:2117 wb_do_writeback fs/fs-writeback.c:2264 [inline] wb_workfn+0x410/0x1090 fs/fs-writeback.c:2304 process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3254 [inline] process_scheduled_works+0xa12/0x17c0 kernel/workqueue.c:3335 worker_thread+0x86d/0xd70 kernel/workqueue.c:3416 kthread+0x2f2/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:388 ret_from_fork+0x4d/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244The root cause is: inline_data inode can be fuzzed, so that there maybe valid blkaddr in its direct node, once f2fs triggers background GCto migrate the block, it will hit f2fs_bug_on() during dirty pagewriteback.Let's add sanity check on F2FS_INLINE_DATA flag in inode during GC,so that, it can forbid migrating inline_data inode's data block forfixing.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-44942` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-lowlatency - 4.15.0-231.243\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1158-kvm - 4.15.0-1158.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1175-aws - 4.15.0-1175.188\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1183-azure - 4.15.0-1183.198\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-gcp - 4.15.0-1168.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-oracle - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
