		"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due toincorrect data validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may succeedagainst HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allowsany client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poisonthe browser cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrarysource. Squid uses a string search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encodingheader to find chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to hide a secondrequest inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by Squid as chunked andsplit out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will then delivertwo distinct responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15811` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid-cgi - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid-common - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid-purge - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquid3 - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nsquidclient - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.9\nNo subscription required",
