		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:kthread: unpark only parked kthreadCalling into kthread unparking unconditionally is mostly harmless whenthe kthread is already unparked. The wake up is then simply ignoredbecause the target is not in TASK_PARKED state.However if the kthread is per CPU, the wake up is preceded by a callto kthread_bind() which expects the task to be inactive and inTASK_PARKED state, which obviously isn't the case if it is unparked.As a result, calling kthread_stop() on an unparked per-cpu kthreadtriggers such a warning:\tWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at kernel/kthread.c:525 __kthread_bind_maskkernel/kthread.c:525\t <TASK>\t kthread_stop+0x17a/0x630 kernel/kthread.c:707\t destroy_workqueue+0x136/0xc40 kernel/workqueue.c:5810\t wg_destruct+0x1e2/0x2e0 drivers/net/wireguard/device.c:257\t netdev_run_todo+0xe1a/0x1000 net/core/dev.c:10693\t default_device_exit_batch+0xa14/0xa90 net/core/dev.c:11769\t ops_exit_list net/core/net_namespace.c:178 [inline]\t cleanup_net+0x89d/0xcc0 net/core/net_namespace.c:640\t process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3231 [inline]\t process_scheduled_works+0xa2c/0x1830 kernel/workqueue.c:3312\t worker_thread+0x86d/0xd70 kernel/workqueue.c:3393\t kthread+0x2f0/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\t ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\t ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\t </TASK>Fix this with skipping unecessary unparking while stopping a kthread.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50019` to fix the vulnerability.
