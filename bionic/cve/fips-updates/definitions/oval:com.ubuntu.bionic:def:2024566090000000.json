		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: rtw88: use ieee80211_purge_tx_queue() to purge TX skbWhen removing kernel modules by:   rmmod rtw88_8723cs rtw88_8703b rtw88_8723x rtw88_sdio rtw88_coreDriver uses skb_queue_purge() to purge TX skb, but not report tx statuscausing \"Have pending ack frames!\" warning. Use ieee80211_purge_tx_queue()to correct this.Since ieee80211_purge_tx_queue() doesn't take locks, to prevent racingbetween TX work and purge TX queue, flush and destroy TX work in advance.   wlan0: deauthenticating from aa:f5:fd:60:4c:a8 by local     choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)   ------------[ cut here ]------------   Have pending ack frames!
