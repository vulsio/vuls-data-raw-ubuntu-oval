		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86/amd/pmc: Only disable IRQ1 wakeup where i8042 actually enableditWakeup for IRQ1 should be disabled only in cases where i8042 hadactually enabled it, otherwise \"wake_depth\" for this IRQ will try todrop below zero and there will be an unpleasant WARN() logged:kernel: atkbd serio0: Disabling IRQ1 wakeup source to avoid platformfirmware bugkernel: ------------[ cut here ]------------kernel: Unbalanced IRQ 1 wake disablekernel: WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 6431 at kernel/irq/manage.c:920irq_set_irq_wake+0x147/0x1a0The PMC driver uses DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() to define its dev_pm_opswhich sets amd_pmc_suspend_handler() to the .suspend, .freeze, and.poweroff handlers. i8042_pm_suspend(), however, is only set asthe .suspend handler.Fix the issue by call PMC suspend handler only from the same set ofdev_pm_ops handlers as i8042_pm_suspend(), which currently means justthe .suspend handler.To reproduce this issue try hibernating (S4) the machine after a fresh bootwithout putting it into s2idle first.[ij: edited the commit message.]",
