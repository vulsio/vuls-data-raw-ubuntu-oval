		"description": "Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN,Infinity, and -Infinity JSON values in fields of m.room.member events,allowing remote attackers to execute a denial of service attack against thefederation and common Matrix clients. If such a malformed event is acceptedinto the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by anupgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redactedinstead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members, theimpact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.",
