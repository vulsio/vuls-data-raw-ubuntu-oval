		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen/netfront: destroy queues before real_num_tx_queues is zeroedxennet_destroy_queues() relies on info->netdev->real_num_tx_queues todelete queues. Since d7dac083414eb5bb99a6d2ed53dc2c1b405224e5(\"net-sysfs: update the queue counts in the unregistration path\"),unregister_netdev() indirectly sets real_num_tx_queues to 0. Those twofacts together means, that xennet_destroy_queues() called fromxennet_remove() cannot do its job, because it's called afterunregister_netdev(). This results in kfree-ing queues that are stilllinked in napi, which ultimately crashes:    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000    #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode    #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page    PGD 0 P4D 0    Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI    CPU: 1 PID: 52 Comm: xenwatch Tainted: G        W5.16.10-1.32.fc32.qubes.x86_64+ #226    RIP: 0010:free_netdev+0xa3/0x1a0    Code: ff 48 89 df e8 2e e9 00 00 48 8b 43 50 48 8b 08 48 8d b8 a0 fe ffff 48 8d a9 a0 fe ff ff 49 39 c4 75 26 eb 47 e8 ed c1 66 ff <48> 8b 85 6001 00 00 48 8d 95 60 01 00 00 48 89 ef 48 2d 60 01 00    RSP: 0000:ffffc90000bcfd00 EFLAGS: 00010286    RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88800edad000 RCX: 0000000000000000    RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffc90000bcfc30 RDI: 00000000ffffffff    RBP: fffffffffffffea0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000    R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffff88800edad050    R13: ffff8880065f8f88 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff8880066c6680    FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880f3300000(0000)knlGS:0000000000000000    CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033    CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 00000000e998c006 CR4: 00000000003706e0    Call Trace:     <TASK>     xennet_remove+0x13d/0x300 [xen_netfront]     xenbus_dev_remove+0x6d/0xf0     __device_release_driver+0x17a/0x240     device_release_driver+0x24/0x30     bus_remove_device+0xd8/0x140     device_del+0x18b/0x410     ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x16/0x30     ? klist_iter_exit+0x14/0x20     ? xenbus_dev_request_and_reply+0x80/0x80     device_unregister+0x13/0x60     xenbus_dev_changed+0x18e/0x1f0     xenwatch_thread+0xc0/0x1a0     ? do_wait_intr_irq+0xa0/0xa0     kthread+0x16b/0x190     ? set_kthread_struct+0x40/0x40     ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30     </TASK>Fix this by calling xennet_destroy_queues() from xennet_uninit(),when real_num_tx_queues is still available.
