		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: fix node UAF in binder_add_freeze_work()In binder_add_freeze_work() we iterate over the proc->nodes with theproc->inner_lock held. However, this lock is temporarily dropped inorder to acquire the node->lock first (lock nesting order). This canrace with binder_node_release() and trigger a use-after-free:  ==================================================================  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in _raw_spin_lock+0xe4/0x19c  Write of size 4 at addr ffff53c04c29dd04 by task freeze/640  CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 640 Comm: freeze Not tainted6.11.0-07343-ga727812a8d45 #17  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)  Call trace:   _raw_spin_lock+0xe4/0x19c   binder_add_freeze_work+0x148/0x478   binder_ioctl+0x1e70/0x25ac   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x124/0x190  Allocated by task 637:   __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x12c/0x27c   binder_new_node+0x50/0x700   binder_transaction+0x35ac/0x6f74   binder_thread_write+0xfb8/0x42a0   binder_ioctl+0x18f0/0x25ac   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x124/0x190  Freed by task 637:   kfree+0xf0/0x330   binder_thread_read+0x1e88/0x3a68   binder_ioctl+0x16d8/0x25ac   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x124/0x190  ==================================================================Fix the race by taking a temporary reference on the node beforereleasing the proc->inner lock.
