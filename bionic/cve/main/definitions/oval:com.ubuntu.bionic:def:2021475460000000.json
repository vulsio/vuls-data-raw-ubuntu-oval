		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipv6:fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppress The kernel leaks memory when a `fib`rule is present in IPv6 nftables firewall rules and a suppress_prefix ruleis present in the IPv6 routing rules (used by certain tools such aswg-quick). In such scenarios, every incoming packet will leak an allocationin `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache. After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing andsource code reading, I tracked down the issue to ca7a03c41753 (\"ipv6: donot free rt if FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule\"). The problem withthat change is that the generic `args->flags` always have`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` notdecreasing the refcount when needed. How to reproduce: - Add the followingnftables rule to a prerouting chain: meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark .iif oif missing drop This can be done with: sudo nft create table inet testsudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook preroutingpriority filter + 10; policy accept; }' sudo nft add rule inet testtest_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop - Run:sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0 - Watch `sudoslabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase with everyincoming ipv6 packet. This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to theprotocol specific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific`flags` argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the genericFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.
