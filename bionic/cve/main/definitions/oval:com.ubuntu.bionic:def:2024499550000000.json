		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ACPI: battery: Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hookWhen a battery hook returns an error when adding a new battery, thenthe battery hook is automatically unregistered.However the battery hook provider cannot know that, so it will latercall battery_hook_unregister() on the already unregistered batteryhook, resulting in a crash.Fix this by using the list head to mark already unregistered batteryhooks as already being unregistered so that they can be ignored bybattery_hook_unregister().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-49955` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required",
