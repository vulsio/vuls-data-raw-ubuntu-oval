		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then`block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function_does_ have code to try to handle it with:  if (*reg)    dump_addr = *reg;...but since \"dump_addr\" is initialized to NULL the above is actuallya noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.Make the function print \"Registers not stored\" when it sees a NULL tosolve this. Since we're touching the code, fixmsm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointerand properly mark the pointer as `const`.Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/619657/",
