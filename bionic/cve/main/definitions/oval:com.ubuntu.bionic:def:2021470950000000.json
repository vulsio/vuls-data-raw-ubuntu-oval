		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipmi:ssif: initialize ssif_info->client early During probe ssif_info->client isdereferenced in error path. However, it is set when some of the errorchecking has already been done. This causes following kernel crash if anerror path is taken: [ 30.645593][ T674] ipmi_ssif 0-000e: ipmi_ssif: Notprobing, Interface already present [ 30.657616][ T674] Unable to handlekernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000088 ...
