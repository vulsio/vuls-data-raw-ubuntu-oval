		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc()If we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a new node, and thenrace with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, we'llstill have a preallocated node that might be used later.If we then use that node for a new non-root node, it'll still have apointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this by zeroing itin the cmpxchg failure path.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47668` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-200-generic - 5.4.0-200.220~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-200-lowlatency - 5.4.0-200.220~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1135-aws - 5.4.0-1135.145~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1140-azure - 5.4.0-1140.147~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1139-gcp - 5.4.0-1139.148~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-ibm - 5.4.0-1082.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1134-oracle - 5.4.0-1134.143~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
