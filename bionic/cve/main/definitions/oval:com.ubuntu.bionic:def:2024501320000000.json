		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing/probes: Fix MAX_TRACE_ARGS limit handlingWhen creating a trace_probe we would set nr_args prior to truncating thearguments to MAX_TRACE_ARGS. However, we would only initialize argumentsup to the limit.This caused invalid memory access when attempting to set up probes withmore than 128 fetchargs.  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page  PGD 0 P4D 0  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI  CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1769 Comm: cat Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7+ #8  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-1.fc3904/01/2014  RIP: 0010:__set_print_fmt+0x134/0x330Resolve the issue by applying the MAX_TRACE_ARGS limit earlier.
