		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up Thereare cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believes theNPIV is logged into the fabric. This occurs when a vport is unregisteredbefore the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the fabric.Currently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDsincluding the fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees thendlp rport object. This sometimes causes the race condition where the finalDA_ID and LOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch. Fix bymoving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID andLOGO are sent.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36952` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-204-generic - 5.4.0-204.224~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-204-lowlatency - 5.4.0-204.224~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1137-aws - 5.4.0-1137.147~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1141-gcp - 5.4.0-1141.150~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1084-ibm - 5.4.0-1084.89~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1136-oracle - 5.4.0-1136.145~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
