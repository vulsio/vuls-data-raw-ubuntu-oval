		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: fix OOB in binder_add_freeze_work()In binder_add_freeze_work() we iterate over the proc->nodes with theproc->inner_lock held. However, this lock is temporarily dropped toacquire the node->lock first (lock nesting order). This can race withbinder_deferred_release() which removes the nodes from the proc->nodesrbtree and adds them into binder_dead_nodes list. This leads to a brokeniteration in binder_add_freeze_work() as rb_next() will use data frombinder_dead_nodes, triggering an out-of-bounds access:  ==================================================================  BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in rb_next+0xfc/0x124  Read of size 8 at addr ffffcb84285f7170 by task freeze/660  CPU: 8 UID: 0 PID: 660 Comm: freeze Not tainted6.11.0-07343-ga727812a8d45 #18  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)  Call trace:   rb_next+0xfc/0x124   binder_add_freeze_work+0x344/0x534   binder_ioctl+0x1e70/0x25ac   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x124/0x190  The buggy address belongs to the variable:   binder_dead_nodes+0x10/0x40  [...]  ==================================================================This is possible because proc->nodes (rbtree) and binder_dead_nodes(list) share entries in binder_node through a union:\tstruct binder_node {\t[...]\t\tunion {\t\t\tstruct rb_node rb_node;\t\t\tstruct hlist_node dead_node;\t\t};Fix the race by checking that the proc is still alive. If not, simplybreak out of the iteration.",
