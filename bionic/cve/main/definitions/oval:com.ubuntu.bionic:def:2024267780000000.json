		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fbdev:savage: Error out if pixclock equals zero The userspace program could passany values to the driver through ioctl() interface. If the driver doesn'tcheck the value of pixclock, it may cause divide-by-zero error. Althoughpixclock is checked in savagefb_decode_var(), but it is not checkedproperly in savagefb_probe(). Fix this by checking whether pixclock is zeroin the function savagefb_check_var() before info->var.pixclock is used asthe divisor. This is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed bycommit 15cf0b8.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26778` to fix the vulnerability.
