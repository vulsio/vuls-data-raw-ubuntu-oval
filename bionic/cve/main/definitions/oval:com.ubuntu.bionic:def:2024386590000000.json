		"title": "CVE-2024-38659 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: enic:Validate length of nl attributes in enic_set_vf_port enic_set_vf_portassumes that the nl attribute IFLA_PORT_PROFILE is of lengthPORT_PROFILE_MAX and that the nl attributes IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID,IFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID are of length PORT_UUID_MAX. These attributes arevalidated (in the function do_setlink in rtnetlink.c) using the nla_policyifla_port_policy. The policy defines IFLA_PORT_PROFILE as NLA_STRING,IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID as NLA_BINARY and IFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID asNLA_STRING. That means that the length validation using the policy is forthe max size of the attributes and not on exact size so the length of theseattributes might be less than the sizes that enic_set_vf_port expects. Thismight cause an out of bands read access in the memcpys of the data of theseattributes in enic_set_vf_port.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38659` to fix the vulnerability.
