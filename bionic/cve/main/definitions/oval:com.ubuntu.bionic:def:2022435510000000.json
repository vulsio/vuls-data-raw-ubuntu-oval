		"description": "A vulnerability exists in curl <7.87.0 HSTS check that could be bypassed totrick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructedto use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even whenHTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS mechanism could be bypassedif the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that getreplaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like usingthe character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the commonASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`. Then in a subsequent request, it does notdetect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it wouldstore the info IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-43551` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.21\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.21\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.21\nlibcurl4 - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.21\nNo subscription required",
