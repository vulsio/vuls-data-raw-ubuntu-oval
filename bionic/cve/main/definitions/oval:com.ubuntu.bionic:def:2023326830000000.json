		"description": "Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twistedframework. A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the`url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially allowing server siderequest forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IPaddresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (bydefault this only allows public IPs) and by the limited informationreturned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSONresponse or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information isdiscarded. 2. For discovered image URLs, any non-image response isdiscarded. Systems which have URL preview disabled (via the`url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a`url_preview_url_blacklist` are not affected. This issue has been addressedin version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade. User unable to upgrade mayalso disable URL previews.",
