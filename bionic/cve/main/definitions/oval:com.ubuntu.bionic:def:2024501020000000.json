		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86: fix user address masking non-canonical speculation issueIt turns out that AMD has a \"Meltdown Lite(tm)\" issue with non-canonicalaccesses in kernel space.  And so using just the high bit to decidewhether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the goodold \"leak speculative data\" if you have the right gadget using theresult:  CVE-2020-12965 “Transient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses“Now, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and thoseinstructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures,which closes the speculation window.But that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1].That improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that thespeculation window is now open.Note that this affects not just the new address masking, but also theregular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asmversion of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers.It does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since there's nospeculative result to be used in a gadget for those operations.",
