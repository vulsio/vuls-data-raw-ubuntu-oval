		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md: fix deadlock between mddev_suspend and flush bioDeadlock occurs when mddev is being suspended while some flush bio is inprogress. It is a complex issue.T1. the first flush is at the ending stage, it clears 'mddev->flush_bio'    and tries to submit data, but is blocked because mddev is suspended    by T4.T2. the second flush sets 'mddev->flush_bio', and attempts to queue    md_submit_flush_data(), which is already running (T1) and won't    execute again if on the same CPU as T1.T3. the third flush inc active_io and tries to flush, but is blockedbecause    'mddev->flush_bio' is not NULL (set by T2).T4. mddev_suspend() is called and waits for active_io dec to 0 which is inc    by T3.  T1\t\tT2\t\tT3\t\tT4  (flush 1)\t(flush 2)\t(third 3)\t(suspend)  md_submit_flush_data   mddev->flush_bio = NULL;   .   .\t \tmd_flush_request   .\t  \t mddev->flush_bio = bio   .\t  \t queue submit_flushes   .\t\t .   .\t\t .\t\tmd_handle_request   .\t\t .\t\t active_io + 1   .\t\t .\t\t md_flush_request   .\t\t .\t\t  wait !mddev->flush_bio   .\t\t .   .\t\t .\t\t\t\tmddev_suspend   .\t\t .\t\t\t\t wait !active_io   .\t\t .   .\t\t submit_flushes   .\t\t queue_work md_submit_flush_data   .\t\t //md_submit_flush_data is already running (T1)   .   md_handle_request    wait resumeThe root issue is non-atomic inc/dec of active_io during flush process.active_io is dec before md_submit_flush_data is queued, and inc soonafter md_submit_flush_data() run.  md_flush_request    active_io + 1    submit_flushes      active_io - 1      md_submit_flush_data        md_handle_request        active_io + 1          make_request        active_io - 1If active_io is dec after md_handle_request() instead of withinsubmit_flushes(), make_request() can be called directly intead ofmd_handle_request() in md_submit_flush_data(), and active_io willonly inc and dec once in the whole flush process. Deadlock will befixed.Additionally, the only difference between fixing the issue and before isthat there is no return error handling of make_request(). But afterprevious patch cleaned md_write_start(), make_requst() only return errorin raid5_make_request() by dm-raid, see commit 41425f96d7aa (\"dm-raid456,md/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent withreshape)\". Since dm always splits data and flush operation into twoseparate io, io size of flush submitted by dm always is 0, make_request()will not be called in md_submit_flush_data(). To prevent futuremodifications from introducing issues, add WARN_ON to ensuremake_request() no error is returned in this context.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43855` to fix the vulnerability.
