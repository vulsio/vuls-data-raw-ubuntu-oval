Thismeans that reparenting (happened when the device is actually freed)is delayed and, during that delay, parent controller device (hciX)may be deleted. Since the latter may create a dangling pointer tofreed parent, avoid that scenario by reparenting to NULL explicitly.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53237` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1008-oracle - 4.15.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required",
