Such TCP socket may have had SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPFset before it was ESTABLISHED. In other words, a non-NULL sk_reuseport_cbdoes not imply a non-refcounted socket.Drop sk's reference in both error paths.unreferenced object 0xffff888101911800 (size 2048):  comm \"test_progs\", pid 44109, jiffies 4297131437  hex dump (first 32 bytes):    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................    80 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................  backtrace (crc 9336483b):    __kmalloc_noprof+0x3bf/0x560    __reuseport_alloc+0x1d/0x40    reuseport_alloc+0xca/0x150    reuseport_attach_prog+0x87/0x140    sk_reuseport_attach_bpf+0xc8/0x100    sk_setsockopt+0x1181/0x1990    do_sock_setsockopt+0x12b/0x160    __sys_setsockopt+0x7b/0xc0    __x64_sys_setsockopt+0x1b/0x30    do_syscall_64+0x93/0x180    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",
