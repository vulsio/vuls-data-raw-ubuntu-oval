		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfs: Fix kernel async DIONetfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO thatis supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,this gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning andfails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.  This can betriggered through a combination of cifs and a loopback blockdev withsomething like:        mount //my/cifs/share /foo        dd if=/dev/zero of=/foo/m0 bs=4K count=1K        losetup --sector-size 4096 --direct-io=on /dev/loop2046 /foo/m0        echo hello >/dev/loop2046This causes the following to appear in syslog:        WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 109 at fs/netfs/iterator.c:50netfs_extract_user_iter+0x170/0x250 [netfs]and the write to fail.Fix this by removing the check in netfs_unbuffered_write_iter_locked() thatcauses async kernel DIO writes to be handled as userspace writes.  Notethat this change relies on the kernel caller maintaining the existence ofthe bio_vec array (or kvec[] or folio_queue) until the op is complete.",
