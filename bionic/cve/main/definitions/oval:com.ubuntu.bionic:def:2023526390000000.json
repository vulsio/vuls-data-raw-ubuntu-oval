		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:s390: vsie: fix race during shadow creation Right now it is possible to seegmap->private being zero in kvm_s390_vsie_gmap_notifier resulting in acrash. This is due to the fact that we add gmap->private == kvm aftercreation: static int acquire_gmap_shadow(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, structvsie_page *vsie_page) { [...] gmap = gmap_shadow(vcpu->arch.gmap, asce,edat); if (IS_ERR(gmap)) return PTR_ERR(gmap); gmap->private = vcpu->kvm;Let children inherit the private field of the parent.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52639` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-generic - 4.15.0-231.243\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-231-lowlatency - 4.15.0-231.243\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1158-kvm - 4.15.0-1158.163\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1175-aws - 4.15.0-1175.188\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1183-azure - 4.15.0-1183.198\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-gcp - 4.15.0-1168.185\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1137-oracle - 4.15.0-1137.148\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
