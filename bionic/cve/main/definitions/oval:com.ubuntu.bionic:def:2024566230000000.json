		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: qla2xxx: Fix use after free on unloadSystem crash is observed with stack trace warning of use afterfree. There are 2 signals to tell dpc_thread to terminate (UNLOADINGflag and kthread_stop).On setting the UNLOADING flag when dpc_thread happens to run at the timeand sees the flag, this causes dpc_thread to exit and clean upitself. When kthread_stop is called for final cleanup, this causes useafter free.Remove UNLOADING signal to terminate dpc_thread.  Use the kthread_stopas the main signal to exit dpc_thread.[596663.812935] kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:294![596663.812950] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI[596663.812957] CPU: 13 PID: 1475935 Comm: rmmod Kdump: loaded Tainted: G       IOE    --------- -  - 4.18.0-240.el8.x86_64 #1[596663.812960] Hardware name: HP ProLiant DL380p Gen8, BIOS P70 08/20/2012[596663.812974] RIP: 0010:__slab_free+0x17d/0x360...[596663.813008] Call Trace:[596663.813022]  ? __dentry_kill+0x121/0x170[596663.813030]  ? _cond_resched+0x15/0x30[596663.813034]  ? _cond_resched+0x15/0x30[596663.813039]  ? wait_for_completion+0x35/0x190[596663.813048]  ? try_to_wake_up+0x63/0x540[596663.813055]  free_task+0x5a/0x60[596663.813061]  kthread_stop+0xf3/0x100[596663.813103]  qla2x00_remove_one+0x284/0x440 [qla2xxx]",
