		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fail verification for sign-extension of packet data/data_end/data_metasyzbot reported a kernel crash due to  commit 1f1e864b6555 (\"bpf: Handle sign-extenstin ctx member accesses\").The reason is due to sign-extension of 32-bit load forpacket data/data_end/data_meta uapi field.The original code looks like:        r2 = *(s32 *)(r1 + 76) /* load __sk_buff->data */        r3 = *(u32 *)(r1 + 80) /* load __sk_buff->data_end */        r0 = r2        r0 += 8        if r3 > r0 goto +1        ...Note that __sk_buff->data load has 32-bit sign extension.After verification and convert_ctx_accesses(), the final asm code lookslike:        r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)        r2 = (s32)r2        r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)        r0 = r2        r0 += 8        if r3 > r0 goto pc+1        ...Note that 'r2 = (s32)r2' may make the kernel __sk_buff->data addressinvalidwhich may cause runtime failure.Currently, in C code, typically we have        void *data = (void *)(long)skb->data;        void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end;        ...and it will generate        r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)        r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)        r0 = r2        r0 += 8        if r3 > r0 goto pc+1If we allow sign-extension,        void *data = (void *)(long)(int)skb->data;        void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end;        ...the generated code looks like        r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)        r2 <<= 32        r2 s>>= 32        r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)        r0 = r2        r0 += 8        if r3 > r0 goto pc+1and this will cause verification failure since \"r2 <<= 32\" is not allowedas \"r2\" is a packet pointer.To fix this issue for case  r2 = *(s32 *)(r1 + 76) /* load __sk_buff->data */this patch added additional checking in is_valid_access() callbackfunction for packet data/data_end/data_meta access. If those accessesare with sign-extenstion, the verification will fail.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/000000000000c90eee061d236d37@google.com/",
