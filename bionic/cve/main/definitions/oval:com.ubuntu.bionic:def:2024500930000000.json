		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal: intel: int340x: processor: Fix warning during module unloadThe processor_thermal driver uses pcim_device_enable() to enable a PCIdevice, which means the device will be automatically disabled on driverdetach.  Thus there is no need to call pci_disable_device() again on it.With recent PCI device resource management improvements, e.g. commitf748a07a0b64 (\"PCI: Remove legacy pcim_release()\"), this problem isexposed and triggers the warining below.
