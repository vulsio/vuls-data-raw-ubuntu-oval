		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: fnic: Move flush_work initialization out of if blockAfter commit 379a58caa199 (\"scsi: fnic: Move fnic_fnic_flush_tx() to awork queue\"), it can happen that a work item is sent to an uninitializedwork queue.  This may has the effect that the item being queued is neveractually queued, and any further actions depending on it will notproceed.The following warning is observed while the fnic driver is loaded:kernel: WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 0 at ../kernel/workqueue.c:1524__queue_work+0x373/0x410kernel:  <IRQ>kernel:  queue_work_on+0x3a/0x50kernel:  fnic_wq_copy_cmpl_handler+0x54a/0x730 [fnic62fbff0c42e7fb825c60a55cde2fb91facb2ed24]kernel:  fnic_isr_msix_wq_copy+0x2d/0x60 [fnic62fbff0c42e7fb825c60a55cde2fb91facb2ed24]kernel:  __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x36/0x1a0kernel:  handle_irq_event_percpu+0x30/0x70kernel:  handle_irq_event+0x34/0x60kernel:  handle_edge_irq+0x7e/0x1a0kernel:  __common_interrupt+0x3b/0xb0kernel:  common_interrupt+0x58/0xa0kernel:  </IRQ>It has been observed that this may break the rediscovery of FibreChannel devices after a temporary fabric failure.This patch fixes it by moving the work queue initialization out ofan if block in fnic_probe().",
