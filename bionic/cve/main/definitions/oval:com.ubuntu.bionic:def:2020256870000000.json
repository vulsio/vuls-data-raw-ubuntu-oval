		"description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based bufferoverflow was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before itvalidates the received DNS entries. This flaw allows a remote attacker, whocan create valid DNS replies, to cause an overflow in a heap-allocatedmemory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks inrfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code executememcpy() with a negative size in sort_rrset() and cause a crash in dnsmasq,resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from thisvulnerability is to system availability.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25687` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-base - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
