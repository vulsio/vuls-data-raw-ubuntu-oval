		"description": "An unintended cleartext issue exists in Go before 1.8.4 and 1.9.x before1.9.1. RFC 4954 requires that, during SMTP, the PLAIN auth scheme must onlybe used on network connections secured with TLS. The originalimplementation of smtp.PlainAuth in Go 1.0 enforced this requirement, andit was documented to do so. In 2013, upstream issue #5184, this was changedso that the server may decide whether PLAIN is acceptable. The result isthat if you set up a man-in-the-middle SMTP server that doesn't advertiseSTARTTLS and does advertise that PLAIN auth is OK, the smtp.PlainAuthimplementation sends the username and password.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-15042` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngolang-1.9 - 1.9.4-1ubuntu1\ngolang-1.9-go - 1.9.4-1ubuntu1\ngolang-1.9-src - 1.9.4-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
