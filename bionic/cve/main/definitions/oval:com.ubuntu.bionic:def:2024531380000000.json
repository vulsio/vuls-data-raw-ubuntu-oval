		"title": "CVE-2024-53138 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix incorrect page refcountingThe kTLS tx handling code is using a mix of get_page() andpage_ref_inc() APIs to increment the page reference. But on the releasepath (mlx5e_ktls_tx_handle_resync_dump_comp()), only put_page() is used.This is an issue when using pages from large folios: the get_page()references are stored on the folio page while the page_ref_inc()references are stored directly in the given page. On release the foliopage will be dereferenced too many times.This was found while doing kTLS testing with sendfile() + ZC when theserved file was read from NFS on a kernel with NFS large folios support(commit 49b29a573da8 (\"nfs: add support for large folios\")).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53138` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required",
