		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/hyperv: Fix NULL deref in set_hv_tscchange_cb() if Hyper-V setup failsCheck for a valid hv_vp_index array prior to derefencing hv_vp_index whensetting Hyper-V's TSC change callback. If Hyper-V setup failed inhyperv_init(), the kernel will still report that it's running underHyper-V, but will have silently disabled nearly all functionality.
