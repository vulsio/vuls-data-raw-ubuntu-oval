		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: clk:mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probe mt8183-mfgcfg hasa mutual dependency with genpd during the probing stage, which leads to adeadlock in the following call stack: CPU0: genpd_lock --> clk_prepare_lockgenpd_power_off_work_fn() genpd_lock() generic_pm_domain::power_off()clk_unprepare() clk_prepare_lock() CPU1: clk_prepare_lock --> genpd_lockclk_register() __clk_core_init() clk_prepare_lock() clk_pm_runtime_get()genpd_lock() Do a runtime PM get at the probe function to make sureclk_register() won't acquire the genpd lock. Instead of only modifyingmt8183-mfgcfg, do this on all mediatek clock controller probings because wedon't believe this would cause any regression. Verified on MT8183 andMT8192 Chromebooks.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27002` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1008-oracle - 4.15.0-1008.10\nNo subscription required",
