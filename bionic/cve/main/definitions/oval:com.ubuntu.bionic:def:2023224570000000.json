		"description": "CKEditor Integration UI adds support for editing wiki pages using CKEditor.Prior to versions 1.64.3,t he `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked aprotection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to executemacros with the rights of the current user. If a privileged user withprogramming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to thisdocument with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a correspondingURL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitraryremote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access privateinformation or impact the availability of the wiki. The issue has beenpatched in the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also beenpatched in the version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled startingwith XWiki 14.6 RC1. There are no known workarounds for this other thanupgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed version.",
