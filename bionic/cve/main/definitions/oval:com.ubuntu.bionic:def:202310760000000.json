		"title": "CVE-2023-1076 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socketUID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initializationfunction. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices requireCAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user onlyhaving that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectlytreated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1076` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-generic - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-152-lowlatency - 5.4.0-152.169~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1104-aws - 5.4.0-1104.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1110-azure - 5.4.0-1110.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1107-gcp - 5.4.0-1107.116~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1051-ibm - 5.4.0-1051.56~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1103-oracle - 5.4.0-1103.112~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1088-raspi - 5.4.0-1088.99~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
