Skip rule evaluation if the ct helper extension doesnot exist. Thus, you can only create expectations from the first packet. Itshould be possible to remove this limitation by adding a new action toattach a generic ct helper to the first packet. Then, use this ct helperextension from follow up packets to create the ct expectation.
