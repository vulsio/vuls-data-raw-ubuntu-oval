		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bcache: revert replacing IS_ERR_OR_NULL with IS_ERR againCommit 028ddcac477b (\"bcache: Remove unnecessary NULL point check innode allocations\") leads a NULL pointer deference in cache_set_flush().1721         if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(c->root))1722                 list_add(&c->root->list, &c->btree_cache);>From the above code in cache_set_flush(), if previous registration codefails before allocating c->root, it is possible c->root is NULL as whatit is initialized. __bch_btree_node_alloc() never returns NULL butc->root is possible to be NULL at above line 1721.This patch replaces IS_ERR() by IS_ERR_OR_NULL() to fix this.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-48881` to fix the vulnerability.
