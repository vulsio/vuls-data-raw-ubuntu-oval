		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:leds: trigger: Unregister sysfs attributes before calling deactivate()Triggers which have trigger specific sysfs attributes typically storerelated data in trigger-data allocated by the activate() callback andfreed by the deactivate() callback.Calling device_remove_groups() after calling deactivate() leaves a windowwhere the sysfs attributes show/store functions could be called afterdeactivation and then operate on the just freed trigger-data.Move the device_remove_groups() call to before deactivate() to closethis race window.This also makes the deactivation path properly do things in reverse orderof the activation path which calls the activate() callback before callingdevice_add_groups().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43830` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required",
