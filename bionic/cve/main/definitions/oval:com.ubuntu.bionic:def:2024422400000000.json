		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigationWhen BHI mitigation is enabled, if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag setthen entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls theclear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler(exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outsidetheentry_SYSENTER_compat() function.To address this issue, entry_SYSENTER_compat() should useCLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORYafter making sure the TF flag is cleared.The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:  $ cat sysenter_step.c  int main()  { asm(\"pushf; pop %ax; bts $8,%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter\"); }  $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c  $ ./sysenter_step  Segmentation fault (core dumped)The program is expected to crash, and the #DB handler will issue a warning.Kernel log:  WARNING: CPU: 27 PID: 7000 at arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:1009exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160  ...
