		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: zlib: fix avail_in bytes for s390 zlib HW compression pathSince the input data length passed to zlib_compress_folios() can bearbitrary, always setting strm.avail_in to a multiple of PAGE_SIZE maycause read-in bytes to exceed the input range. Currently this triggersan assert in btrfs_compress_folios() on the debug kernel (see below).Fix strm.avail_in calculation for S390 hardware acceleration path.  assertion failed: *total_in <= orig_len, in fs/btrfs/compression.c:1041  ------------[ cut here ]------------  kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/compression.c:1041!  monitor event: 0040 ilc:2 [#1] PREEMPT SMP  CPU: 16 UID: 0 PID: 325 Comm: kworker/u273:3 Not tainted6.13.0-20241204.rc1.git6.fae3b21430ca.300.fc41.s390x+debug #1  Hardware name: IBM 3931 A01 703 (z/VM 7.4.0)  Workqueue: btrfs-delalloc btrfs_work_helper  Krnl PSW : 0704d00180000000 0000021761df6538(btrfs_compress_folios+0x198/0x1a0)             R:0 T:1 IO:1 EX:1 Key:0 M:1 W:0 P:0 AS:3 CC:1 PM:0 RI:0 EA:3  Krnl GPRS: 0000000080000000 0000000000000001 00000000000000470000000000000000             0000000000000006 ffffff01757bb000 000001976232fcc0000000000000130c             000001976232fcd0 000001976232fcc8 00000118ff4a0e300000000000000001             00000111821ab400 0000011100000000 0000021761df6534000001976232fb58  Krnl Code: 0000021761df6528: c020006f5ef4        larl%r2,0000021762be2310             0000021761df652e: c0e5ffbd09d5        brasl%r14,00000217615978d8            #0000021761df6534: af000000            mc      0,0            >0000021761df6538: 0707                bcr     0,%r7             0000021761df653a: 0707                bcr     0,%r7             0000021761df653c: 0707                bcr     0,%r7             0000021761df653e: 0707                bcr     0,%r7             0000021761df6540: c004004bb7ec        brcl0,000002176276d518  Call Trace:   [<0000021761df6538>] btrfs_compress_folios+0x198/0x1a0  ([<0000021761df6534>] btrfs_compress_folios+0x194/0x1a0)   [<0000021761d97788>] compress_file_range+0x3b8/0x6d0   [<0000021761dcee7c>] btrfs_work_helper+0x10c/0x160   [<0000021761645760>] process_one_work+0x2b0/0x5d0   [<000002176164637e>] worker_thread+0x20e/0x3e0   [<000002176165221a>] kthread+0x15a/0x170   [<00000217615b859c>] __ret_from_fork+0x3c/0x60   [<00000217626e72d2>] ret_from_fork+0xa/0x38  INFO: lockdep is turned off.
