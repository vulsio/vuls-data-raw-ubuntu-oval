		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm-verity: restart or panic on an I/O errorMaxim Suhanov reported that dm-verity doesn't crash if an I/O errorhappens. In theory, this could be used to subvert security, because anattacker can create sectors that return error with the Write Uncorrectablecommand. Some programs may misbehave if they have to deal with EIO.This commit fixes dm-verity, so that if \"panic_on_corruption\" or\"restart_on_corruption\" was specified and an I/O error happens, themachine will panic or restart.This commit also changes kernel_restart to emergency_restart -kernel_restart calls reboot notifiers and these reboot notifiers may waitfor the bio that failed. emergency_restart doesn't call the notifiers.",
