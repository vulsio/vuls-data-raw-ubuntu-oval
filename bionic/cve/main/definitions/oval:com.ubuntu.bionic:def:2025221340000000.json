		"description": "When switching to other buffers using the :all command and visual modestill being active, this may cause a heap-buffer overflow, because Vim doesnot properly end visual mode and therefore may try to access beyond the endof a line in a buffer. In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset thevisual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix thisbug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position ifthe position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact ismedium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the:all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4afor reporting this issue. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patchv9.1.1003",
