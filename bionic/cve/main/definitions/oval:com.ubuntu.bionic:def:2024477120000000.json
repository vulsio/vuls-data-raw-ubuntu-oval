		"title": "CVE-2024-47712 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue inwilc_parse_join_bss_paramIn the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section isunlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing thispointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memorythat has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developedby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable`ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field isthen assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value issafely accessed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47712` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-generic-lpae - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-4.13.0-16-lowlatency - 4.13.0-16.19\nlinux-image-extra-4.13.0-16-generic - 4.13.0-16.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1002-kvm - 4.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1001-aws - 4.15.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1082-azure - 4.15.0-1082.92\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-gcp - 4.15.0-1071.81\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1007-oracle - 4.15.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required",
