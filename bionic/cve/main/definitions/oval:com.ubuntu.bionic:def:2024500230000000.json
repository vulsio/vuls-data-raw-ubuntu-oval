		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: phy: Remove LED entry from LEDs list on unregisterCommit c938ab4da0eb (\"net: phy: Manual remove LEDs to ensure correctordering\") correctly fixed a problem with using devm_ but missedremoving the LED entry from the LEDs list.This cause kernel panic on specific scenario where the port for the PHYis torn down and up and the kmod for the PHY is removed.On setting the port down the first time, the assosiacted LEDs arecorrectly unregistered. The associated kmod for the PHY is now removed.The kmod is now added again and the port is now put up, the associated LEDare registered again.On putting the port down again for the second time after these step, theLED list now have 4 elements. With the first 2 already unregisteredpreviously and the 2 new one registered again.This cause a kernel panic as the first 2 element should have beenremoved.Fix this by correctly removing the element when LED is unregistered.",
