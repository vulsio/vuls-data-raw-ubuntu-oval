		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware: arm_scpi: Fix string overflow in SCPI genpd driver Without thebound checks for scpi_pd->name, it could result in the buffer overflow whencopying the SCPI device name from the corresponding device tree node as thename string is set at maximum size of 30. Let us fix it by usingdevm_kasprintf so that the string buffer is allocated dynamically.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47609` to fix the vulnerability.
