		"title": "CVE-2020-1749 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of some networkingprotocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6. When anencrypted tunnel is created between two hosts, the kernel isn't correctlyrouting tunneled data over the encrypted link; rather sending the dataunencrypted. This would allow anyone in between the two endpoints to readthe traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to dataconfidentiality.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-1749` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-106-generic - 4.15.0-106.107\nlinux-image-4.15.0-106-generic-lpae - 4.15.0-106.107\nlinux-image-4.15.0-106-lowlatency - 4.15.0-106.107\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-106-generic - 4.15.0-106.107\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-106-lowlatency - 4.15.0-106.107\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-40-generic - 5.3.0-40.32~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-40-generic-lpae - 5.3.0-40.32~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.3.0-40-lowlatency - 5.3.0-40.32~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-40-generic - 5.3.0-40.32~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-40-lowlatency - 5.3.0-40.32~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1087-oem - 4.15.0-1087.97\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1059-oem-osp1 - 5.0.0-1059.64\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1067-kvm - 4.15.0-1067.68\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1073-aws - 4.15.0-1073.77\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1013-azure - 5.3.0-1013.14~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1012-gcp - 5.3.0-1012.13~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1063-gke - 4.15.0-1063.66\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.0.0-1042-gke - 5.0.0-1042.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1045-oracle - 4.15.0-1045.49\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1063-raspi2 - 4.15.0-1063.67\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.15.0-1080-snapdragon - 4.15.0-1080.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1018-raspi2 - 5.3.0-1018.20~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1012-gke - 5.3.0-1012.13~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.3.0-1011-oracle - 5.3.0-1011.12~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1089-azure - 4.15.0-1089.99\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.3.0-1016-aws - 5.3.0-1016.17~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1077-gcp - 4.15.0-1077.87\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-generic - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-37-lowlatency - 5.4.0-37.41~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1020-aws - 5.4.0-1020.20~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1022-azure - 5.4.0-1022.22~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-gcp - 5.4.0-1021.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1010-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1021-oracle - 5.4.0-1021.21~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1013-raspi - 5.4.0-1013.13~18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
