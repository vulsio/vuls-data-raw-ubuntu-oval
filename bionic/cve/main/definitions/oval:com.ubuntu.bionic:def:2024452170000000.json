		"description": "Insecure Default Initialization of Resource vulnerability in Apache Solr.New ConfigSets that are created via a Restore command, which copy aconfigSet from the backup and give it a new name, are created withoutsetting the \"trusted\" metadata.ConfigSets that do not contain the flag are trusted implicitly if themetadata is missing, therefore this leads to \"trusted\" ConfigSets that maynot have been created with an Authenticated request.\"trusted\" ConfigSets are able to load custom code into classloaders,therefore the flag is supposed to only be set when the request that uploadsthe ConfigSet is Authenticated & Authorized.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before9.7.0. This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured viaAuthentication/Authorization.Users are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorizationwhen running Solr. However, upgrading to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4 willmitigate this issue otherwise.",
