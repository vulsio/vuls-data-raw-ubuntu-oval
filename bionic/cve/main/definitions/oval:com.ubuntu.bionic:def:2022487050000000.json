		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:mt76: mt7921e: fix crash in chip reset fail In case of drv own fail inreset, we may need to run mac_reset several times. The sequence wouldtrigger system crash as the log below. Because we do not re-enable/schedule\"tx_napi\" before disable it again, the process would keep waiting for statechange in napi_diable(). To avoid the problem and keep status synchronizefor each run, goto final resource handling if drv own failed.
