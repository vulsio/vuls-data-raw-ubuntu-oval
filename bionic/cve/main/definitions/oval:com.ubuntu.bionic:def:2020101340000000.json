		"description": "Pairing in BluetoothÂ® Core v5.2 and earlier may permit an unauthenticatedattacker to acquire credentials with two pairing devices via adjacentaccess when the unauthenticated user initiates different pairing methods ineach peer device and an end-user erroneously completes both pairingprocedures with the MITM using the confirmation number of one peer as thepasskey of the other. An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could be ableto initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed bythe enabled Bluetooth profiles. This exposure may be limited when the usermust authorize certain access explicitly, but so long as a user assumesthat it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-localprotections may be weakened.",
