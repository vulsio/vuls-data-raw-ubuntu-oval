		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming deviceiwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reasonseems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out beforeinterrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resumetrying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued formthe interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventuallythe whole thing blows up.Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts beforeinterrupts get enabled during resume.Here's a debug log of the indicent:[   12.042589] ieee80211 phy0: il_isr ISR inta 0x00000080, enabled0xaa00008b, fh 0x00000000[   12.042625] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_irq_tasklet inta 0x00000080, enabled0x00000000, fh 0x00000000[   12.042651] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: RF_KILL bit toggled to enable radio.[   12.042653] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: On demand firmware reload[   12.042690] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_irq_tasklet End inta 0x00000000,enabled 0xaa00008b, fh 0x00000000, flags 0x00000282[   12.052207] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_mac_start enter[   12.052212] ieee80211 phy0: il_prep_station Add STA to driver ID 31:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff[   12.052244] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_set_hw_ready hardware  ready[   12.052324] ieee80211 phy0: il_apm_init Init card's basic functions[   12.052348] ieee80211 phy0: il_apm_init L1 Enabled; Disabling L0S[   12.055727] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_load_bsm Begin load bsm[   12.056140] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_verify_bsm Begin verify bsm[   12.058642] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_verify_bsm BSM bootstrap uCode imageOK[   12.058721] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_load_bsm BSM write complete, poll 1iterations[   12.058734] ieee80211 phy0: __il4965_up iwl4965 is coming up[   12.058737] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_mac_start Start UP work done.[   12.058757] ieee80211 phy0: __il4965_down iwl4965 is going down[   12.058761] ieee80211 phy0: il_scan_cancel_timeout Scan cancel timeout[   12.058762] ieee80211 phy0: il_do_scan_abort Not performing scan toabort[   12.058765] ieee80211 phy0: il_clear_ucode_stations Clearing ucodestations in driver[   12.058767] ieee80211 phy0: il_clear_ucode_stations No active stationsfound to be cleared[   12.058819] ieee80211 phy0: _il_apm_stop Stop card, put in low powerstate[   12.058827] ieee80211 phy0: _il_apm_stop_master stop master[   12.058864] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_clear_free_frames 0 frames onpre-allocated heap on clear.[   12.058869] ieee80211 phy0: Hardware restart was requested[   16.132299] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: START_ALIVE timeout after 4000ms.[   16.132303] ------------[ cut here ]------------[   16.132304] Hardware became unavailable upon resume.
