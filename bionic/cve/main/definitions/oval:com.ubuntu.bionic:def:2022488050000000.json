		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixupax88179_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can betriggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular: - The metadata array (hdr_off..hdr_off+2*pkt_cnt) can be out of bounds,   causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips. - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB   endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already   been handed off into the network stack. - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end,   causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB's   data.I have tested that this can be used by a malicious USB device to send abogus ICMPv6 Echo Request and receive an ICMPv6 Echo Reply in responsethat contains random kernel heap data.It's probably also possible to get OOB writes from this on alittle-endian system somehow - maybe by triggering skb_cow() via IPoptions processing -, but I haven't tested that.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48805` to fix the vulnerability.
