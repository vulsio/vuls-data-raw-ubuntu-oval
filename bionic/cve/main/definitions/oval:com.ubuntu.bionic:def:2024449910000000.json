		"title": "CVE-2024-44991 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp: prevent concurrent execution of tcp_sk_exit_batchIts possible that two threads call tcp_sk_exit_batch() concurrently,once from the cleanup_net workqueue, once from a task that failed to clonea new netns.  In the latter case, error unwinding calls the exit handlersin reverse order for the 'failed' netns.tcp_sk_exit_batch() calls tcp_twsk_purge().Problem is that since commit b099ce2602d8 (\"net: Batch inet_twsk_purge\"),this function picks up twsk in any dying netns, not just the one passedin via exit_batch list.This means that the error unwind of setup_net() can \"steal\" and destroytimewait sockets belonging to the exiting netns.This allows the netns exit worker to proceed to callWARN_ON_ONCE(!refcount_dec_and_test(&net->ipv4.tcp_death_row.tw_refcount));without the expected 1 -> 0 transition, which then splats.At same time, error unwind path that is also running inet_twsk_purge()will splat as well:WARNING: .. at lib/refcount.c:31 refcount_warn_saturate+0x1ed/0x210... refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:351 [inline] inet_twsk_kill+0x758/0x9c0 net/ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c:70 inet_twsk_deschedule_put net/ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c:221 inet_twsk_purge+0x725/0x890 net/ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c:304 tcp_sk_exit_batch+0x1c/0x170 net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:3522 ops_exit_list+0x128/0x180 net/core/net_namespace.c:178 setup_net+0x714/0xb40 net/core/net_namespace.c:375 copy_net_ns+0x2f0/0x670 net/core/net_namespace.c:508 create_new_namespaces+0x3ea/0xb10 kernel/nsproxy.c:110... because refcount_dec() of tw_refcount unexpectedly dropped to 0.This doesn't seem like an actual bug (no tw sockets got lost and I don'tsee a use-after-free) but as erroneous trigger of debug check.Add a mutex to force strict ordering: the task that calls tcp_twsk_purge()blocks other task from doing final _dec_and_test before mutex-owner hasremoved all tw sockets of dying netns.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-44991` to fix the vulnerability.
