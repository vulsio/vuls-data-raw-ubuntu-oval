		"title": "CVE-2024-43839 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bna: adjust 'name' buf size of bna_tcb and bna_ccb structuresTo have enough space to write all possible sprintf() args. Currently'name' size is 16, but the first '%s' specifier may already need atleast 16 characters, since 'bnad->netdev->name' is used there.For '%d' specifiers, assume that they require: * 1 char for 'tx_id + tx_info->tcb[i]->id' sum, BNAD_MAX_TXQ_PER_TX is 8 * 2 chars for 'rx_id + rx_info->rx_ctrl[i].ccb->id', BNAD_MAX_RXP_PER_RX   is 16And replace sprintf with snprintf.Detected using the static analysis tool - Svace.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-43839` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-200-generic - 5.4.0-200.220~18.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-200-lowlatency - 5.4.0-200.220~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1139-gcp - 5.4.0-1139.148~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1082-ibm - 5.4.0-1082.87~18.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
