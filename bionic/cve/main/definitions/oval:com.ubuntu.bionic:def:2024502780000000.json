		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resumeOut-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedlybefore the first-time resume of the cache table. This happens becauseexpanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table forcache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the newsize, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during thefirst resume, leading to the issue.Reproduce steps:1. prepare component devices:dmsetup create cmeta --table \"0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0\"dmsetup create cdata --table \"0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192\"dmsetup create corig --table \"0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144\"dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data   structures inadequate.dmsetup create cache --notabledmsetup reload cache --table \"0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \\/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0\"dmsetup reload cdata --table \"0 131072 linear /dev/sdc 8192\"dmsetup resume cdatadmsetup resume cache3. suspend the cache to write out the in-core dirty bitset and hint   array, leading to out-of-bounds access to the dirty bitset at offset   0x40:dmsetup suspend cacheKASAN reports:  BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in is_dirty_callback+0x2b/0x80  Read of size 8 at addr ffffc90000085040 by task dmsetup/90  (...snip...)
