    "Description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the trapper command functionality of Zabbix Server 2.4.X. A specially crafted set of packets can cause a command injection resulting in remote code execution. An attacker can make requests from an active Zabbix Proxy to trigger this vulnerability. It was discovered that Zabbix incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
