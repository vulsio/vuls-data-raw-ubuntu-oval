    "Title": "CVE-2002-2439 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "operator new[] sometimes returns pointers to heap blocks which are too small.  When a new array is allocated, the C++ run-time has to calculate its size.  The product may exceed the maximum value which can be stored in a machine register.  This error is ignored, and the truncated value is used for the heap allocation. This may lead to heap overflows and therefore security bugs. (See http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/advisories/calloc.php for further references.)",

Fixing this would be intrusive, would require rebuilding those packages, and there is no clear attack vector on them. We will not be fixing gcc-4.7 in xenial. Marking as ignored."
