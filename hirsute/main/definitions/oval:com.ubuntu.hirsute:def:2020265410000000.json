		"description": "The Linux kernel through 5.8.13 does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This affects certs/blacklist.c and certs/system_keyring.c. It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce certain types of entries in the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism.
