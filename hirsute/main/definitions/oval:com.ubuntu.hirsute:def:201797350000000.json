		"description": "Jetty through 9.4.x is prone to a timing channel in util/security/Password.java, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by observing elapsed times before rejection of incorrect passwords. It was discovered that Jetty incorrectly handled rejection of passwords. An attacker could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive information via timing side-channel attack.",
