		"description": "MIT krb5 1.6 or later allows an authenticated kadmin with permission to add principals to an LDAP Kerberos database to circumvent a DN containership check by supplying both a \"linkdn\" and \"containerdn\" database argument, or by supplying a DN string which is a left extension of a container DN string but is not hierarchically within the container DN. It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain database arguments. A remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.",
