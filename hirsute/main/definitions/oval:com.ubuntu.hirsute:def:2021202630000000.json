		"description": "A flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) of QEMU. The new 'xattrmap' option may cause the 'security.capability' xattr in the guest to not drop on file write, potentially leading to a modified, privileged executable in the guest. In rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by a malicious user to elevate their privileges within the guest.",
