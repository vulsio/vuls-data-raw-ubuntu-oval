		"description": "Ansible before 1.5.5 constructs filenames containing user and password fields on the basis of deb lines in sources.list, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive credential information in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging existence of a file that uses the \"deb http://user:pass@server:port/\" format. It was discovered that Ansible created filenames containing sensitive information. An attacker could use this vulnerability to obtain unauthorized access to a private Ubuntu repository.",
