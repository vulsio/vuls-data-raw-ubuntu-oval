		"Title": "CVE-2019-12814 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x through 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has JDOM 1.x or 2.x jar in the classpath, an attacker can send a specifically crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.",
