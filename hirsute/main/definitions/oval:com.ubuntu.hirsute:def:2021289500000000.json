		"title": "CVE-2021-28950 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A \"stall on CPU\" can occur because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka CID-775c5033a0d1. It was discovered that the fuse user space file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
