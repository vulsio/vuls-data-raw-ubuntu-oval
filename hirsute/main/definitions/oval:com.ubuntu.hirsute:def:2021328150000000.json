    "Title": "CVE-2021-32815 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The assertion failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when modifying the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`. ### Patches The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5. ### References Regression test and bug fix: #1739 ### For more information Please see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.",
