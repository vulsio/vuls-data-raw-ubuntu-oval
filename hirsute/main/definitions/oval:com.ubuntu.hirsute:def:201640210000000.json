    "Title": "CVE-2016-4021 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "The read_binary function in buffer.c in pgpdump before 0.30 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via crafted input, as demonstrated by the \\xa3\\x03 string. It was discovered that PGPdump incorrectly handled certain inputs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
