See http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/09/06/1 This CVE was later assigned to the same issue, since CVE-2009-2625 was worded as a Java vulnerability. Our USN references CVE-2009-2625 and this CVE will be ignored (for expat). jdstrand provided updates in supported releases for expat, xmlrpc-c, cmake, python-xml, python2.4, and python2.5 ebarretto> this is not an issue for vnc4, for more information see: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560949"
