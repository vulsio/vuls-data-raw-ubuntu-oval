		"title": "CVE-2021-3744 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"description": "A memory leak in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c in the Linux kernel allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
