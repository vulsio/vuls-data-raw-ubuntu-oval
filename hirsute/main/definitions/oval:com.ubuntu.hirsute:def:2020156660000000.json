		"Title": "CVE-2020-15666 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"Description": "When trying to load a non-video in an audio/video context the exact status code (200, 302, 404, 500, 412, 403, etc.) was disclosed via the MediaError Message. This level of information leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80 and Firefox for Android < 80.",
