    "Title": "CVE-2021-3501 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.12. The value of internal.ndata, in the KVM API, is mapped to an array index, which can be updated by a user process at anytime which could lead to an out-of-bounds write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity and system availability. Reiji Watanabe discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent user space from tampering with an array index value, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
