    "Title": "CVE-2021-26931 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as used in Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug, deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at least under the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn't correct to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing such crashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c. Jan Beulich discovered that multiple Xen backends in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).",
