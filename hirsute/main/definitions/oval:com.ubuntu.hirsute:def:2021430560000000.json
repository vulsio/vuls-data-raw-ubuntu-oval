		"title": "CVE-2021-43056 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel for powerpc before 5.14.15. It allows a malicious KVM guest to crash the host, when the host is running on Power8, due to an arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S implementation bug in the handling of the SRR1 register values. It was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be resolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash).",
