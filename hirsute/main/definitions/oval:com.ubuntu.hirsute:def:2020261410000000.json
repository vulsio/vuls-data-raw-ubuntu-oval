    "Title": "CVE-2020-26141 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 6.1316.1209 for AWUS036H. The Wi-Fi implementation does not verify the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject and possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation did not properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets.",
