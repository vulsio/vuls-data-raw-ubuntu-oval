    "Title": "CVE-2020-26145 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation accepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject packets.",
