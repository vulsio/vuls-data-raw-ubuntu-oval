		"description": "arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun. Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel for AMD processors contained race conditions on nested VMCB controls. A local attacker in a guest vm could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.",
