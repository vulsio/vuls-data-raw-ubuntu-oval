    "Description": "libgio, when used in setuid or other privileged programs in spice-gtk and possibly other products, allows local users to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code via the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the applications that do not cleanse environment variables, not in libgio itself.",
