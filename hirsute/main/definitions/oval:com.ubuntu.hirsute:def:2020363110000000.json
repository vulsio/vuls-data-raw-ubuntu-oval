		"Title": "CVE-2020-36311 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.9. arch/x86/kvm/svm/sev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) by triggering destruction of a large SEV VM (which requires unregistering many encrypted regions), aka CID-7be74942f184. It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not ensure enough processing time was given to perform cleanups of large SEV VMs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (soft lockup).",
