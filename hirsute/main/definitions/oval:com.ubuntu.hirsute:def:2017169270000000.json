    "Title": "CVE-2017-16927 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "The scp_v0s_accept function in sesman/libscp/libscp_v0.c in the session manager in xrdp through 0.9.4 uses an untrusted integer as a write length, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted input stream. It was discovered that xrdp could be made to overflow a buffer and crash.",
