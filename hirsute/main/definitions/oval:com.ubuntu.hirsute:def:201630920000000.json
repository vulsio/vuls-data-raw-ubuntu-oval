		"description": "The MultipartStream class in Apache Commons Fileupload before 1.3.2, as used in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.70, 8.x before 8.0.36, 8.5.x before 8.5.3, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M7 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long boundary string. It was discovered that the Tomcat Fileupload library incorrectly handled certain upload requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
