		"description": "The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 66.",
