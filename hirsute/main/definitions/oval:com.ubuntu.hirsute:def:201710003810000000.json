		"title": "CVE-2017-1000381 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "The c-ares function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`, which is used for parsing NAPTR responses, could be triggered to read memory outside of the given input buffer if the passed in DNS response packet was crafted in a particular way. It was discovered that c-ares incorrectly handled certain NAPTR responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause applications using c-ares to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
