This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space Andy Nguyen discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write in its setsockopt() implementation. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
