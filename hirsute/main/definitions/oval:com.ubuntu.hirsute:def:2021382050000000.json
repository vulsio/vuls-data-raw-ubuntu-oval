    "Title": "CVE-2021-38205 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_emaclite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3 makes it easier for attackers to defeat an ASLR protection mechanism because it prints a kernel pointer (i.e., the real IOMEM pointer). It was discovered that the Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the Linux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations. An attacker could use this information to ease the exploitation of another vulnerability.",
