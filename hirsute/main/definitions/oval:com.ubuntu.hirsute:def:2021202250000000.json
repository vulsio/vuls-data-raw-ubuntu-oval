		"Title": "CVE-2021-20225 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The option parser allows an attacker to write past the end of a heap-allocated buffer by calling certain commands with a large number of specific short forms of options. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. It was discovered that the option parser in GRUB 2 contained a heap overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
