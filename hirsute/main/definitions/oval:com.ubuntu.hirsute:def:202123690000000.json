    "Title": "CVE-2021-2369 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Library). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u301, 8u291, 11.0.11, 16.0.1; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.2 and 21.1.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.3 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N). Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK did not properly handle JAR files containing multiple manifest files. An attacker could possibly use this to bypass JAR signature verification.",
