		"Description": "An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the gplotMakeOutput function of Leptonica 1.74.4. A specially crafted gplot rootname argument can cause a command injection resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious path as input to an application that passes attacker data to this function to trigger this vulnerability. It was discovered that Leptonica incorrectly handled certain input arguments. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary commands.",
