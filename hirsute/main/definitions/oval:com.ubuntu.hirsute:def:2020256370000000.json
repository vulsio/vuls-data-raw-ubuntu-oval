		"description": "A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API, in versions before 6.8.0, responsible for requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain. This flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",

Clients connecting to the read-write socket can exploit this to crash libvirt or possibly execute code, but on Ubuntu, access to the read-write socket already grants root-equivalent permissions, so this flaw has limited impact.
