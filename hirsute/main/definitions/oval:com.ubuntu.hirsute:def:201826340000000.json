    "Title": "CVE-2018-2634 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JGSS). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. While the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.8 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N). It was discovered that the Java GSS implementation in OpenJDK in some situations did not properly apply subject credentials. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or gain access to unauthorized resources.",
