		"Title": "CVE-2018-12115 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "In all versions of Node.js prior to 6.14.4, 8.11.4 and 10.9.0 when used with UCS-2 encoding (recognized by Node.js under the names `'ucs2'`, `'ucs-2'`, `'utf16le'` and `'utf-16le'`), `Buffer#write()` can be abused to write outside of the bounds of a single `Buffer`. Writes that start from the second-to-last position of a buffer cause a miscalculation of the maximum length of the input bytes to be written. Nikita Skovoroda  discovered that Node.js mishandled certain input, leading to an out of bounds write. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
