		"description": "runc through 1.0.0-rc8, as used in Docker through 19.03.2-ce and other products, allows AppArmor restriction bypass because libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go incorrectly checks mount targets, and thus a malicious Docker image can mount over a /proc directory. It was discovered that runC incorrectly implemented AppArmor restrictions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to mount malicious images.",
