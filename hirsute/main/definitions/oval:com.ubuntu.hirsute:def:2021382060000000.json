    "Title": "CVE-2021-38206 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "The mac80211 subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, when a device supporting only 5 GHz is used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference in the radiotap parser) by injecting a frame with 802.11a rates. Ben Greear discovered that the mac80211 subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
