    "Title": "CVE-2021-20268 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the eBPF code verifier in the way a user running the eBPF script calls dev_map_init_map or sock_map_alloc. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle signed add32 and sub integer overflows. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
