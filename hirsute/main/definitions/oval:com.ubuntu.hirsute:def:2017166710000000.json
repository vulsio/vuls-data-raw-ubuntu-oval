    "Title": "CVE-2017-16671 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - high.",
    "Description": "A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13 before 13.18.1, 14 before 14.7.1, and 15 before 15.1.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.13 before 13.13-cert7. No size checking is done when setting the user field for Party B on a CDR. Thus, it is possible for someone to use an arbitrarily large string and write past the end of the user field storage buffer. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2017-7617, which was only about the Party A buffer. It was discovered that asterisk did not properly check the length of certain input. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
