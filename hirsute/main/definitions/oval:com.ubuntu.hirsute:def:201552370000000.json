		"note": "seth-arnold> No fix as of 2015-08-27, since the message parsing limit defaults to 64 megabytes a software author would have to change the limit in order to handle larger messages anyway, and is thus unlikely to generate these messages in the short-term. (There is no actual limit on generation, so this might be an issue today -- it is just not a priority for the maintainer.)"
