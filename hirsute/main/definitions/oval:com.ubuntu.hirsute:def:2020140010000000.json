		"description": "The kramdown gem before 2.3.0 for Ruby processes the template option inside Kramdown documents by default, which allows unintended read access (such as template=\"/etc/passwd\") or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such as a string that begins with template=\"string://<%= `). NOTE: kramdown is used in Jekyll, GitLab Pages, GitHub Pages, and Thredded Forum. It was discovered that kramdown insecurely handled certain crafted input. An attacker could use this vulnerability to read restricted files or execute arbitrary code.",
