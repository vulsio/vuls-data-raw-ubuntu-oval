    "Title": "CVE-2020-36385 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10. drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c has a use-after-free because the ctx is reached via the ctx_list in some ucma_migrate_id situations where ucma_close is called, aka CID-f5449e74802c. It was discovered that the Infiniband RDMA userspace connection manager implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possible execute arbitrary code.",
