		"title": "CVE-2016-8734 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"description": "Apache Subversion's mod_dontdothat module and HTTP clients 1.4.0 through 1.8.16, and 1.9.0 through 1.9.4 are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack caused by exponential XML entity expansion. The attack can cause the targeted process to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources or memory. Florian Weimer discovered that Subversion clients did not properly restrict XML entity expansion when accessing http(s):// URLs. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
