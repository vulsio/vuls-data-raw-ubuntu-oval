		"description": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in gluster 3.x snapshot scheduler. Any gluster client allowed to mount gluster volumes could also mount shared gluster storage volume and escalate privileges by scheduling malicious cronjob via symlink. It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled mounting gluster volumes. An attacker could possibly use this issue to also mount shared gluster volumes and escalate privileges through malicious cronjobs.",
