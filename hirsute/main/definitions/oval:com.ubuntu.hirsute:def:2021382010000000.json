		"Title": "CVE-2021-38201 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "net/sunrpc/xdr.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (xdr_set_page_base slab-out-of-bounds access) by performing many NFS 4.2 READ_PLUS operations. It was discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds access error. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
