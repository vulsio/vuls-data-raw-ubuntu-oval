    "Title": "CVE-2020-29369 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in mm/mmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.7.11. There is a race condition between certain expand functions (expand_downwards and expand_upwards) and page-table free operations from an munmap call, aka CID-246c320a8cfe. Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling munmap() operations, leading to a read-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
