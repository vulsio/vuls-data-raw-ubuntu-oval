		"description": "The DrawImage function in magick/render.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 does not properly look for pop keywords that are associated with push keywords, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (negative strncpy and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file. It was discovered that GraphicsMagick incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
