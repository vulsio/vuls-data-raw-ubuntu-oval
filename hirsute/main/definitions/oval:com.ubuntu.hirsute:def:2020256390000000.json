		"description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU Nouveau driver functionality in versions prior to 5.12-rc1 in the way the user calls ioctl DRM_IOCTL_NOUVEAU_CHANNEL_ALLOC. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. It was discovered that the Nouveau GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
