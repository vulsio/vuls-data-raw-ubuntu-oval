    "Title": "CVE-2018-13095 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_inode_buf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (memory corruption and BUG) can occur for a corrupted xfs image upon encountering an inode that is in extent format, but has more extents than fit in the inode fork. Wen Xu discovered that the xfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the number of extents in an inode. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
