		"note": "sarnold> It looks like an entire new class of side-channel-free functions was introduced in newer versions of mbedtls; backporting all of them probably doesn't make sense, this fix only makes sense in context of trying to provide constant-time execution that limits side-channel bandwidth to adversaries on the same machine."
