		"description": "An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server. It was discovered that libssh2 mishandled certain input. If libssh2 were used to connect to a malicious or compromised SSH server, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the client system.",
