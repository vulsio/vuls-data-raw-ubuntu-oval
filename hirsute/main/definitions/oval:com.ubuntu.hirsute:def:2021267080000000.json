    "Title": "CVE-2021-26708 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - high.",
    "Description": "A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support. Alexander Popov discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the AF_VSOCK implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
