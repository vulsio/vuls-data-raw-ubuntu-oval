		"title": "CVE-2021-43267 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in net/tipc/crypto.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.16. The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) functionality allows remote attackers to exploit insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes for the MSG_CRYPTO message type. It was discovered that the TIPC Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate MSG_CRYPTO messages in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
