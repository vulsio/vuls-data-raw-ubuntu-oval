		"title": "CVE-2021-43057 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.8. A use-after-free in selinux_ptrace_traceme (aka the SELinux handler for PTRACE_TRACEME) could be used by local attackers to cause memory corruption and escalate privileges, aka CID-a3727a8bac0a. This occurs because of an attempt to access the subjective credentials of another task. Jann Horn discovered that the SELinux subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle subjective credentials for tasks in some situations. On systems where SELinux has been enabled, a local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
