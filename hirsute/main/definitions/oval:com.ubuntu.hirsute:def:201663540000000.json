		"Note": "mdeslaur> introduced in 2.5.36 by https://github.com/westes/flex/commit/9ba3187a537d6a58d345f2874d06087fd4050399 sbeattie> redhat bug claims that it's not exploitable due to followup code also, simply replacing yy_size_t with int on num_to_read as in the upstream patch causes even more signed comparison warnings in flex generated sources; there's a comparison against a size_t variable in YY_INPUT for one. The \"correct\" fix for this likely includes the additional commit mentioned in the oss-security post. fixing will also require recompiling anything with generated code from the versions of flex in vivid through xenial."
