    "Title": "CVE-2021-26910 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "Firejail before 0.9.64.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions because there is a TOCTOU race condition between a stat operation and an OverlayFS mount operation. Roman Fiedler discovered that a race condition existed in Firejail when using OverlayFS to prevent writes to the underlying file system. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. Note: this update disables support for OverlayFS in Firejail.",
