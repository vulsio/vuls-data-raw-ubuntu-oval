		"title": "CVE-2021-38204 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"description": "drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.6 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and panic) by removing a MAX-3421 USB device in certain situations. It was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
