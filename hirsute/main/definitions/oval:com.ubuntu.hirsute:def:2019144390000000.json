		"Description": "A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.2. This occurs when Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the logback jar in the classpath. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.",
