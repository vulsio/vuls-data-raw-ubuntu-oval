    "Description": "An improper computation of p_tx0, p_tx1, p_ty0 and p_ty1 in the function opj_get_encoding_parameters in openjp2/pi.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.0 can lead to an integer overflow. It was discovered that OpenJPEG did not properly handle certain input. If OpenJPEG were supplied with specially crafted input, it could be made to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
