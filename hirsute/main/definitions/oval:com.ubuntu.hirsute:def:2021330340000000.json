		"Title": "CVE-2021-33034 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.12.4, net/bluetooth/hci_event.c has a use-after-free when destroying an hci_chan, aka CID-5c4c8c954409. This leads to writing an arbitrary value. It was discovered that a use-after-free existed in the Bluetooth HCI driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
