		"note": "tyhicks> Note that upstream revision 227687 is incomplete/incorrect. See msg01050.html for a more complete patch that is undergoing review. In gcc-4.7 through gcc-4.8, the code in question exists at libstdc++-v3/include/tr1/random.h and libstdc++-v3/include/bits/random.h In gcc-4.4, the code in question exists at libstdc++-v3/include/tr1_impl/random sbeattie> Note that for versions where the random_device() code in question is in a header file, means that it's compiled into the binaries built against libstdc++, which would need to be rebuilt to get the fixed version. upstream commits (so far) are listed under gcc-snapshots package. Corresponding git commits are: 84bb4e67d45a8921cedd2ef64fe3cffd9ee72f44 8efb09c4325785a5e7d11d05c5aadc74d2a49887 fd16f36d1986fbbb9f802b3649e543f3f41227ea gcc-opt is just a wrapper around gcc, not affected"
