    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to incorrect parser validation, it allows a Denial of Service attack against the Cache Manager API. This allows a trusted client to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is limited to clients with Cache Manager API access privilege.",

    "Note": "mdeslaur> this issue only affects the Cache Manager, which is usually restricted to trusted clients only. The patch is intrusive to backport to 3.x versions, so we will not be fixing this issue in older releases. We recommend setting appropriate access control to limit connections from trusted clients."
