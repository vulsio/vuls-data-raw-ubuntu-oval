    "Title": "CVE-2021-37159 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free. It was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
