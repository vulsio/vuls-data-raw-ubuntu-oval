		"description": "The caml_ba_deserialize function in byterun/bigarray.c in the standard library in OCaml 4.06.0 has an integer overflow which, in situations where marshalled data is accepted from an untrusted source, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted object. It was discovered that OCaml mishandled crafted input. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
