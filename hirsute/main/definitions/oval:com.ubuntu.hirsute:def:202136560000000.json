    "Title": "CVE-2021-3656 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - high.",
    "Description": "[KVM AMD missing validation of the the `virt_ext` VMCB field and allows a malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under these circumstances, the L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE unintercepted, and thus read/write portions of the host physical memory.] Maxim Levitsky and Paolo Bonzini discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel allowed a guest VM to disable restrictions on VMLOAD/VMSAVE in a nested guest. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to read or write portions of the host's physical memory.",
