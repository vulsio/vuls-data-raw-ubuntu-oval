The \"git\" from hardy and earlier is not what was \"git-core\". jdstrand> Maverick and later renamed 'git-core' to 'git', so 'git' in these releases does refer to git VCS. initially marked 'low' since default filesystems on Ubuntu are case-sensitive, however file servers serving these reopositories to clients need to be patched, so upping to medium tyhicks> git upstream fixed a minor regression in the HFS+ .git filtering with commit 6aaf956b"
