		"title": "CVE-2020-14390 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc6. When changing screen size, an out-of-bounds memory write can occur leading to memory corruption or a denial of service. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. It was discovered that the frame buffer implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some edge cases in software scrollback. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
