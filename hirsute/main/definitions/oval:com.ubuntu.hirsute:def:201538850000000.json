		"Title": "CVE-2015-3885 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - negligible.",
		"Description": "Integer overflow in the ljpeg_start function in dcraw 7.00 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted image, which triggers a buffer overflow, related to the len variable. It was discovered that FreeImage incorrectly handled photo files. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted photo file, a remote attacker could cause FreeImage to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
