    "Title": "CVE-2021-28972 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "In drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8, the RPA PCI Hotplug driver has a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to write data to the kernel stack frame directly. This occurs because add_slot_store and remove_slot_store mishandle drc_name '\\0' termination, aka CID-cc7a0bb058b8. It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
