    "Title": "CVE-2020-28974 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "A slab-out-of-bounds read in fbcon in the Linux kernel before 5.9.7 could be used by local attackers to read privileged information or potentially crash the kernel, aka CID-3c4e0dff2095. This occurs because KD_FONT_OP_COPY in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c can be used for manipulations such as font height. Minh Yuan discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle fonts in some conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
