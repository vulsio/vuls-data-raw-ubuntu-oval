		"Title": "CVE-2021-42008 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"Description": "The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access. It was discovered that the 6pack network protocol driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform validation checks. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
