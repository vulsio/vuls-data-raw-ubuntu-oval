		"description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response may output the API response to stdout as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response, escape sequence injection may occur. It was discovered that Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response failed to escape certain characters. An attacker could use this vulnerability inject escape sequences into a victim's terminal.",
