    "Title": "CVE-2019-16089 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.2.13. nbd_genl_status in drivers/block/nbd.c does not check the nla_nest_start_noflag return value. It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for error conditions in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
