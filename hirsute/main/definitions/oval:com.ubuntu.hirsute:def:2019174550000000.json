		"description": "Libntlm through 1.5 relies on a fixed buffer size for tSmbNtlmAuthRequest, tSmbNtlmAuthChallenge, and tSmbNtlmAuthResponse read and write operations, as demonstrated by a stack-based buffer over-read in buildSmbNtlmAuthRequest in smbutil.c for a crafted NTLM request. It was discovered that Libntlm incorrectly handled specially crafted NTML requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or another unspecified impact.",
