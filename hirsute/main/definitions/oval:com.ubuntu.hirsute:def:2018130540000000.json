    "Title": "CVE-2018-13054 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - high.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Cinnamon 1.9.2 through 3.8.6. The cinnamon-settings-users.py GUI runs as root and allows configuration of (for example) other users' icon files in _on_face_browse_menuitem_activated and _on_face_menuitem_activated. These icon files are written to the respective user's $HOME/.face location. If an unprivileged user prepares a symlink pointing to an arbitrary location, then this location will be overwritten with the icon content. Matthias Gerstner discovered that the cinnamon-settings-users utility in Cinnamon did not safely handle symlinks. An unprivileged user could potentially use this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files as root.",
