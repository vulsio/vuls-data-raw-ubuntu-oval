		"description": "GPAC version 0.7.1 and earlier has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the cat_multiple_files function in applications/mp4box/fileimport.c when MP4Box is used for a local directory containing crafted filenames. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
