    "Note": "tyhicks> Setting priority to low since this issue requires a malicious USB device to be inserted into the system Ben Hutchings noticed that commit 6cf97230cd5f (\"media: dvb: usb: fix use after free in dvb_usb_device_exit\"), which is mentioned in the CVE references for this issue, likely doesn't fix the problem. See the lore reference above for details. I think Ben is correct and have adjusted our break-fix metadata to use the break commit that he pointed out."
