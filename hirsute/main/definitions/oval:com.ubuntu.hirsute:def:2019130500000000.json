		"description": "Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.",

		"note": "mdeslaur> this is a weakness in the PGP keyserver design. amurray> gnupg upstream has 2 mitigations for this - firstly, don't import key signatures by default anymore, and to fallback to only import self-signatures on very large keyblocks mdeslaur> as of 2020-01-06, there is no ideal fix for this issue marking this CVE as deferred until a complete fix is available sbeattie> gnupg mitigations landed in upstream in 2.2.17 with important fixes in 2.2.18 2.2.19-3ubuntu1 introduced a debian/ubuntu specific change to use keys.openpgp.org as the default keyserver any backports to address this issue will be complex and introduce changes in behavior sks in debian introduced very basic filtering in 1.1.6+git20210302.c3ba6d5a-1"
