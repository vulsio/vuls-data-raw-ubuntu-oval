		"description": "In the trapper functionality of Zabbix Server 2.4.x, specifically crafted trapper packets can pass database logic checks, resulting in database writes. An attacker can set up a Man-in-the-Middle server to alter trapper requests made between an active Zabbix proxy and Server to trigger this vulnerability. It was discovered that Zabbix incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
