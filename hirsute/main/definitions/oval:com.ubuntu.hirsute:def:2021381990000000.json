		"Title": "CVE-2021-38199 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup ordering, which allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service (hanging of mounts) by arranging for those servers to be unreachable during trunking detection. Michael Wakabayashi discovered that the NFSv4 client implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly order connection setup operations. An attacker controlling a remote NFS server could use this to cause a denial of service on the client.",
