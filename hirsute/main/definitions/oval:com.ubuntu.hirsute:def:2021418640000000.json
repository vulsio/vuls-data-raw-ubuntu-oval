		"Title": "CVE-2021-41864 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"Description": "prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write. It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel when preallocating objects for stack maps. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
