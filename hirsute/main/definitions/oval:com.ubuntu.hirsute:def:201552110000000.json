		"title": "CVE-2015-5211 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "Under some situations, the Spring Framework 4.2.0 to 4.2.1, 4.0.0 to 4.1.7, 3.2.0 to 3.2.14 and older unsupported versions is vulnerable to a Reflected File Download (RFD) attack. The attack involves a malicious user crafting a URL with a batch script extension that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered and also includes some input reflected in the response. Alvaro Mu√±oz discovered that Spring Framework incorrectly handled certain URLs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a reflected file download.",
