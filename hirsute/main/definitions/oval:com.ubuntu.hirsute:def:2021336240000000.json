		"title": "CVE-2021-33624 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "In kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db. Ofek Kirzner, Adam Morrison, Benedict Schlueter, and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel missed possible mispredicted branches due to type confusion, allowing a side-channel attack. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
