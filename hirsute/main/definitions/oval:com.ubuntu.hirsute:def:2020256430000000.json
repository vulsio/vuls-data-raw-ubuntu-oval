		"title": "CVE-2020-25643 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the HDLC_PPP module of the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Memory corruption and a read overflow is caused by improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr function which can cause the system to crash or cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. It was discovered that the HDLC PPP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate input in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
