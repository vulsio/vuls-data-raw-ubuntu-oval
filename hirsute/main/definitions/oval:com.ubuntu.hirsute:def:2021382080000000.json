    "Title": "CVE-2021-38208 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "net/nfc/llcp_sock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.10 allows local unprivileged users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and BUG) by making a getsockname call after a certain type of failure of a bind call. It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle failed connect events leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
