		"title": "CVE-2018-10907 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "It was found that glusterfs server is vulnerable to multiple stack based buffer overflows due to functions in server-rpc-fopc.c allocating fixed size buffers using 'alloca(3)'. An authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a gluster volume and sending a string longer that the fixed buffer size to cause crash or potential code execution. It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled mounting volumes. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or run arbitrary code.",
