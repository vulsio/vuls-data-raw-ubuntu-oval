		"title": "CVE-2019-7308 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.20.6 performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including cases of different branches with different state or limits to sanitize, leading to side-channel attacks. Jann Horn discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel was insufficiently hardened against Spectre V1 attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
