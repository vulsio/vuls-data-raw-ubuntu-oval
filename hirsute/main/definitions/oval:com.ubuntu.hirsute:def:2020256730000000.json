    "Title": "CVE-2020-25673 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel where non-blocking socket in llcp_sock_connect() leads to leak and eventually hanging-up the system. Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
