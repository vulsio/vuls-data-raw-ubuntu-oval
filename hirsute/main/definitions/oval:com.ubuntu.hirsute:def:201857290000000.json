		"description": "MIT krb5 1.6 or later allows an authenticated kadmin with permission to add principals to an LDAP Kerberos database to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) or bypass a DN container check by supplying tagged data that is internal to the database module. It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled tagged data. A remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service.",
