		"description": "An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file in SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability. USN-4238-1 addressed serveral vulnerabilities in SDL_image. This update provides the corresponding fixes for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.",
