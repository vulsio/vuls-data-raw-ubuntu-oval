		"Title": "CVE-2021-38198 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly compute the access permissions for shadow pages in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
