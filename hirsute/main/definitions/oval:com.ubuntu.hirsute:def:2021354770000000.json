		"title": "CVE-2021-35477 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.13.7, an unprivileged BPF program can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a Speculative Store Bypass side-channel attack because a certain preempting store operation does not necessarily occur before a store operation that has an attacker-controlled value. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-channel attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
