		"Title": "CVE-2020-8608 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"Description": "In libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, tcp_subr.c misuses snprintf return values, leading to a buffer overflow in later code. It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator misuses snprintf return values. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
