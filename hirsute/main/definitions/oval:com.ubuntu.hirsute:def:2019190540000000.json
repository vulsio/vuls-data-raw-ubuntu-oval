    "Title": "CVE-2019-19054 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the cx23888_ir_probe() function in drivers/media/pci/cx23885/cx23888-ir.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering kfifo_alloc() failures, aka CID-a7b2df76b42b. It was discovered that the Conexant 23885 TV card device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
