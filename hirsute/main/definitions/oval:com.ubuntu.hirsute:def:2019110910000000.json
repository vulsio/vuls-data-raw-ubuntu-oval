		"description": "Microarchitectural Data Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM): Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access. A list of impacted products can be found here: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/corporate-information/SA00233-microcode-update-guidance_05132019.pdf Ke Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Volodrmyr Pikhur, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that uncacheable memory previously stored in microarchitectural buffers of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
