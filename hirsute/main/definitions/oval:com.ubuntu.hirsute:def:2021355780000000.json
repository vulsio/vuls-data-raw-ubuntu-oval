		"title": "CVE-2021-35578 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and 21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). it was discovered that the TLS implementation in OpenJDK did not properly handle TLS handshakes in certain situations where a Java application is acting as a TLS server. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).",
