    "Note": "mdeslaur> This CVE was originally for the issue that is now CVE=2021-40528 but somehow got switched to the exponent blinding issue instead. The fix to add exponent blinding appears to only have been added to 1.9.x but never backported to 1.8.x, contrary to the CVE description The commit below was never backported to 1.8.x because the upstream developers consider this hardening and not a security issue."
