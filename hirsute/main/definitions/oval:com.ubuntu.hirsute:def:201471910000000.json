		"description": "The qs module before 1.0.0 in Node.js does not call the compact function for array data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by using a large index value to create a sparse array. It was discovered that the qs module in Node.js incorrectly handled inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
