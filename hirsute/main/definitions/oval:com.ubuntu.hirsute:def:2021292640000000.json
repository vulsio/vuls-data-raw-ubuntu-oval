		"title": "CVE-2021-29264 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.10. drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/gianfar.c in the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver allows attackers to cause a system crash because a negative fragment size is calculated in situations involving an rx queue overrun when jumbo packets are used and NAPI is enabled, aka CID-d8861bab48b6. It was discovered that the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver for the Linux kernel did not properly handle receive queue overrun when jumbo frames were enabled in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
