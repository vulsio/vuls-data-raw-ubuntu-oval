		"Title": "CVE-2021-34693 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
		"Description": "net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.10 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory because parts of a data structure are uninitialized. Norbert Slusarek discovered that the CAN broadcast manger (bcm) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
