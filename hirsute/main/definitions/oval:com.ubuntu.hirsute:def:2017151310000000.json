		"note": "seth-arnold> This feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of Unix model to assume that every task run on behalf of a user will be started as a child process of bash or sh run as an interactive or login shell. Environments that want a specific umask set for users should use the pam_umask(8) module as part of the login process. Environments that need a specific umask set for compliance reasons should investigate the feasibility of preparing a single-purpose LSM or seccomp jail interface of some sort."
