    "Title": "CVE-2020-25285 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
    "Description": "A race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.8 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory, cause a NULL pointer dereference, or possibly have unspecified other impact, aka CID-17743798d812. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the hugetlb sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
