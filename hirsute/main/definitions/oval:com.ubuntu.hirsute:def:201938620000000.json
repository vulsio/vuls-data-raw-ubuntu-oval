A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory. It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information.",
