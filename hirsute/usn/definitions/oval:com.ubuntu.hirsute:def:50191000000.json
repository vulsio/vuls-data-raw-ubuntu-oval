		"description": "It was discovered that an assert() could be triggered in the NVIDIA graphics drivers. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-1093)  It was discovered that the NVIDIA graphics drivers permitted an out-of-bounds array access. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-1094)  It was discovered that the NVIDIA graphics drivers contained a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer where they did not properly control calls with embedded parameters in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2021-1095)",
