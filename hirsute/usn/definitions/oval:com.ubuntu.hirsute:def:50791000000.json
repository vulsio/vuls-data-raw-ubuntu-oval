		"title": "5079-1 -- curl vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when sending data to an MQTT server. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22945)  Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled upgrades to TLS. When receiving certain responses from servers, curl would continue without TLS even when the option to require a successful upgrade to TLS was specified. (CVE-2021-22946)  Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled responses received before STARTTLS. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject responses and intercept communications. (CVE-2021-22947)",
