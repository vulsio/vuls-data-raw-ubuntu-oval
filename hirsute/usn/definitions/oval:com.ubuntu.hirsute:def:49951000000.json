		"title": "4995-1 -- Thunderbird vulnerabilities",
		"description": "Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive information, spoof the UI, bypass security restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23961, CVE-2021-23981, CVE-2021-23982, CVE-2021-23987, CVE-2021-23994, CVE-2021-23998, CVE-2021-23999, CVE-2021-29945, CVE-2021-29946, CVE-2021-29967)  It was discovered that extensions could open popup windows with control of the window title in some circumstances. If a user were tricked into installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof a website and trick the user into providing credentials. (CVE-2021-23984)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird's OpenPGP integration. If a user were tricked into importing a specially crafted key in some circumstances, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (inability to send encrypted email) or confuse the user. (CVE-2021-23991, CVE-2021-23992, CVE-2021-23993)  A use-after-free was discovered when Responsive Design Mode was enabled. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted website with Responsive Design Mode enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23995)  It was discovered that Thunderbird mishandled ftp URLs with encoded newline characters. If a user were tricked into clicking on a specially crafted link, an attacker could potentially exploit this to send arbitrary FTP commands. (CVE-2021-24002)  It was discovered that Thunderbird wrote signatures to disk and read them back during verification. A local attacker could potentially exploit this to replace the data with another signature file. (CVE-2021-29948)  It was discovered that Thunderbird might load an alternative OTR library. If a user were tricked into copying a specially crafted library to one of Thunderbird's search paths, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-29949)  It was discovered that secret keys imported into Thunderbird were stored unencrypted. A local attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain private keys. (CVE-2021-29956)  It was discovered that Thunderbird did not indicate when an inline signed or encrypted message contained additional unprotected parts. (CVE-2021-29957)",
