		"description": "James Kettle discovered that the Apache HTTP Server HTTP/2 module incorrectly handled certain crafted methods. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform request splitting or cache poisoning attacks. (CVE-2021-33193)  It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled certain malformed requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-34798)  Li Zhi Xin discovered that the Apache mod_proxy_uwsgi module incorrectly handled certain request uri-paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2021-36160)  It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled escaping quotes. If the server was configured with third-party modules, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39275)  It was discovered that the Apache mod_proxy module incorrectly handled certain request uri-paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the server to forward requests to arbitrary origin servers. (CVE-2021-40438)",
