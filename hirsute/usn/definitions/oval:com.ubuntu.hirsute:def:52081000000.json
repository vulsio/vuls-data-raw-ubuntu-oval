		"title": "5208-1 -- Linux kernel vulnerabilities",
		"description": "Nadav Amit discovered that the hugetlb implementation in the Linux kernel did not perform TLB flushes under certain conditions. A local attacker could use this to leak or alter data from other processes that use huge pages. (CVE-2021-4002)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the overlay file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-20321)  It was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)  It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel when preallocating objects for stack maps. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-41864)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be resolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2021-43056)  It was discovered that the TIPC Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate MSG_CRYPTO messages in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43267)  It was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations that could trigger an array out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43389)",
