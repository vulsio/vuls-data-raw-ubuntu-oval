		"description": "It was discovered that some Intel processors may not properly invalidate cache entries used by Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d). This may allow a local user to perform a privilege escalation attack. (CVE-2020-24489)  Joseph Nuzman discovered that some Intel processors may not properly apply EIBRS mitigations (originally developed for CVE-2017-5715) and hence may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. (CVE-2020-24511)  Travis Downs discovered that some Intel processors did not properly flush cache-lines for trivial-data values. This may allow an unauthorized user to infer the presence of these trivial-data-cache-lines via timing sidechannel attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24512)  It was discovered that certain Intel Atom processors could expose memory contents stored in microarchitectural buffers. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24513)",
