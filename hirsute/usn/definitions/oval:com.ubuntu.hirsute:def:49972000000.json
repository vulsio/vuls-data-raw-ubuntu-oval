		"title": "4997-2 -- Linux kernel (KVM) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "USN-4997-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 21.04. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux KVM kernel for Ubuntu 21.04.  Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3609)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce limits for pointer operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33200)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation did not properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24586)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled encrypted fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to decrypt fragments. (CVE-2020-24587)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled certain malformed frames. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious server, a physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-24588)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders. A physically proximate attacker could inject malicious packets to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-26139)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation did not properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets. (CVE-2020-26141)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation accepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation could reassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)  Or Cohen discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23133)  Or Cohen and Nadav Markus discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the nfc implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23134)  Manfred Paul discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds vulnerability. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-31440)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent speculative loads in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-31829)  It was discovered that a race condition in the kernel Bluetooth subsystem could lead to use-after-free of slab objects. An attacker could use this issue to possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-32399)  It was discovered that a use-after-free existed in the Bluetooth HCI driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33034)  It was discovered that an out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw existed in the f2fs module of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-3506)  Mathias Krause discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the Nitro Enclaves kernel driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3543)",
