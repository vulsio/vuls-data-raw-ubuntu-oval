Original advisory details:   Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were  tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could  potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive  information, conduct spoofing attacks, bypass CSP restrictions, or  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43536, CVE-2021-43537, CVE-2021-43538,  CVE-2021-43539, CVE-2021-43541, CVE-2021-43542, CVE-2021-43543,  CVE-2021-43545, CVE-2021-43546)    A security issue was discovered with the handling of WebExtension  permissions.
