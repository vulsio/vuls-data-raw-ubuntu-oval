		"description": "It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform access control. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129)  Michael Brown discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle malformed packets from a network PV frontend, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28691)  It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle HCI device initialization failure, leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3564)  It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle HCI device detach events, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3573)  It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle failed connect events leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3587)",
