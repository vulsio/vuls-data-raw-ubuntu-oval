		"title": "5113-1 -- Linux kernel vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Atheros Ath9k WiFi driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (WiFi network traffic). (CVE-2020-3702)  Alois Wohlschlager discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux kernel did not restrict private clones in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3732)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly handle removing a non-existent device id. An attacker with CAP_SYS_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3739)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3743)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3753)  It was discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow in its hash table implementation. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-38166)  It was discovered that the ext4 file system in the Linux kernel contained a race condition when writing xattrs to an inode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2021-40490)  It was discovered that the 6pack network protocol driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform validation checks. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42008)",
