		"description": "USN-4628-1 provided updated Intel Processor Microcode for various processor types.  This update provides the corresponding updates for some additional processor types.  Original advisory details:   Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Andreas Kogler, David Oswald, Catherine  Easdon, Claudio Canella, and Daniel Gruss discovered that the Intel Running  Average Power Limit (RAPL) feature of some Intel processors allowed a side-  channel attack based on power consumption measurements. A local attacker  could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8695)    Ezra Caltum, Joseph Nuzman, Nir Shildan and Ofir Joseff discovered that  some Intel(R) Processors did not properly remove sensitive information  before storage or transfer in some situations. A local attacker could  possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8696)    Ezra Caltum, Joseph Nuzman, Nir Shildan and Ofir Joseff discovered that  some Intel(R) Processors did not properly isolate shared resources in some  situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive  information. (CVE-2020-8698)",
