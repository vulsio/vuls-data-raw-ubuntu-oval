		"description": "Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass security restrictions, spoof the browser UI, confuse the user, conduct phishing attacks, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-38503, CVE-2021-38504, CVE-2021-38506, CVE-2021-38507, CVE-2021-38508, CVE-2021-38509)  It was discovered that the 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image URL after redirects. If a user were tricked into copying and pasting a link for an embedded image that triggered authentication flows back to the page, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal authentication tokens.",
