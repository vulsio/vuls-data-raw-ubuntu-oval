		"description": "It was discovered that BlueZ incorrectly handled the Discoverable status when a device is powered down. This could result in devices being powered up discoverable, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 21.04, and Ubuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-3658)  It was discovered that BlueZ incorrectly handled certain memory operations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause BlueZ to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2021-41229)  It was discovered that the BlueZ gatt server incorrectly handled disconnects. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause BlueZ to crash, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2021-43400)",
