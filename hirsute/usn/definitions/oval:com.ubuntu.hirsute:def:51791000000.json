If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted gzip archive, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause BusyBox to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28831)  It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain malformed LZMA archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted LZMA archive, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause BusyBox to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly leak sensitive information. (CVE-2021-42374)  Vera Mens, Uri Katz, Tal Keren, Sharon Brizinov, and Shachar Menashe discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain awk patterns. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted awk pattern, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause BusyBox to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
