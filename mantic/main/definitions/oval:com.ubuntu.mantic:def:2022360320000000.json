		"description": "ReactPHP HTTP is a streaming HTTP client and server implementation forReactPHP. In ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions starting with 0.7.0and prior to 1.7.0, when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP cookievalues, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies withprefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with cookies that decodeto such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookiewhich is supposed to be secure. This issue is fixed in ReactPHP HTTPversion 1.7.0. As a workaround, Infrastructure or DevOps can place areverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out anyunexpected `Cookie` request headers.",
