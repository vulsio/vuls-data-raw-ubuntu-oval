		"description": "Due to the Asset Explorer agent not validating HTTPS certificates, anattacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to matchthe Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to senda NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receivethe agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agentresponding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POSTpayload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted toUnicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big.If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.",
