		"description": "As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissionsof temporary files it created so that only the current user was allowed toaccess them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file andcreated a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying theeffort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source filesinto the build process.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-11979` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nant - 1.10.9-1\nant-optional - 1.10.9-1\nNo subscription required",
