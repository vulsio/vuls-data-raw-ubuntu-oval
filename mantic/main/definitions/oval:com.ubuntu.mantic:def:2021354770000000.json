		"Title": "CVE-2021-35477 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.13.7, an unprivileged BPF program can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a Speculative Store Bypass side-channel attack because a certain preempting store operation does not necessarily occur before a store operation that has an attacker-controlled value. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-channel attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-35477` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required",
