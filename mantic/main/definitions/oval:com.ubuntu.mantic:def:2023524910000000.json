		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling inmtk_jpeg_dec_device_runIn mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound withmtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.In mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens inmtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker whilemark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.There are two methods to trigger the bug. If we remove themodule, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup.The possible sequence is as follows, which will cause ause-after-free bug.CPU0                  CPU1mtk_jpeg_dec_...    |  start worker\t    |                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_workmtk_jpeg_remove     |  v4l2_m2m_release  |    kfree(m2m_dev); |                    |                    | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv                    |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //useIf we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release,it will have a similar sequence.Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec workersuccessfully.
