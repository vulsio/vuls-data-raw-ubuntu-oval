		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooksThe ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not expectedto call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume(). Remove callsto those in the cadence-qspi driver. Those helpers have two rolescurrently: - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker.- They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It requiresacquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex. Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspiis not queued. Step two however has two implications: - A deadlock occurs,because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context where the lock is alreadytaken (in the ->exec_op() callback, where the usage count is incremented).- It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended. Hereis a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock: spi_mem_exec_op() ...spi_mem_access_start() mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)cqspi_exec_mem_op() pm_runtime_resume_and_get() cqspi_resume()spi_controller_resume() mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex) ...spi_mem_access_end() mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex) ...",
