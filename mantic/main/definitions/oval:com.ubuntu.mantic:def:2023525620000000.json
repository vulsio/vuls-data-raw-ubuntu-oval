		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slab_common: fix slab_caches list corruption after kmem_cache_destroy()After the commit in Fixes:, if a module that created a slab cache does notrelease all of its allocated objects before destroying the cache (at rmmodtime), we might end up releasing the kmem_cache object without removing itfrom the slab_caches list thus corrupting the list as kmem_cache_destroy()ignores the return value from shutdown_cache(), which in turn never removesthe kmem_cache object from slabs_list in case __kmem_cache_shutdown() failsto release all of the cache's slabs.This is easily observable on a kernel built with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=yas after that ill release the system will immediately trip on list_add,or list_del, assertions similar to the one shown below as soon as anotherkmem_cache gets created, or destroyed:  [ 1041.213632] list_del corruption. next->prev should beffff89f596fb5768, but was 52f1e5016aeee75d.
