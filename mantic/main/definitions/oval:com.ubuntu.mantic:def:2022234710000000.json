		"description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found incontainerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on thehost. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminalresize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launchdue to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waitingto send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes andcrictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation andthe stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has beenfixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to theseversions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure thatonly trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users havepermissions to execute commands in running containers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23471` to fix the vulnerability.
