		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header The TCPoption parser in cake qdisc (cake_get_tcpopt and cake_tcph_may_drop) couldread one byte out of bounds. When the length is 1, the execution flow getsinto the loop, reads one byte of the opcode, and if the opcode is neitherTCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP, it reads one more byte, which exceeds the lengthof 1. This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (\"ipv4: tcp_input: fixstack out of bounds when parsing TCP options.\"). v2 changes: Added doffvalidation in cake_get_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCP header.Although it wasn't strictly an out-of-bounds access (memory was allocated),garbage values could be read where CAKE expected the TCP header if doff wassmaller than 5.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47243` to fix the vulnerability.
