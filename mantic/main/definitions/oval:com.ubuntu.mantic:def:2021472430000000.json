		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and headerThe TCP option parser in cake qdisc (cake_get_tcpopt andcake_tcph_may_drop) could read one byte out of bounds. When the lengthis 1, the execution flow gets into the loop, reads one byte of theopcode, and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP, it readsone more byte, which exceeds the length of 1.This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (\"ipv4: tcp_input: fix stackout of bounds when parsing TCP options.\").v2 changes:Added doff validation in cake_get_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCPheader. Although it wasn't strictly an out-of-bounds access (memory wasallocated), garbage values could be read where CAKE expected the TCPheader if doff was smaller than 5.",
