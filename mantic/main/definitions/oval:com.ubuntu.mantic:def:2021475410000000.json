		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx4_en: Fix an use-after-free bug in mlx4_en_try_alloc_resources() Inmlx4_en_try_alloc_resources(), mlx4_en_copy_priv() is called and tmp->tx_cqwill be freed on the error path of mlx4_en_copy_priv(). After thatmlx4_en_alloc_resources() is called and there is a dereference of&tmp->tx_cq[t][i] in mlx4_en_alloc_resources(), which could lead to a useafter free problem on failure of mlx4_en_copy_priv(). Fix this bug byadding a check of mlx4_en_copy_priv() This bug was found by a staticanalyzer. The analysis employs differential checking to identifyinconsistent security operations (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two codepaths and confirms that the inconsistent operations are not recovered inthe current function or the callers, so they constitute bugs. Note that, asa bug found by static analysis, it can be a false positive or hard totrigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed the bug. Builds withCONFIG_MLX4_EN=m show no new warnings, and our static analyzer no longerwarns about this code.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47541` to fix the vulnerability.
