		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hv_netvsc: Don't free decrypted memory In CoCo VMs it is possible for theuntrusted host to cause set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() tofail such that an error is returned and the resulting memory is shared.Callers need to take care to handle these errors to avoid returningdecrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator, which could lead tofunctional or security issues. The netvsc driver could freedecrypted/shared pages if set_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decryptedfield in the gpadl to decide whether to free the memory.",
