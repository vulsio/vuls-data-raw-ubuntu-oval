		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: serial:8250: omap: Don't skip resource freeing if pm_runtime_resume_and_get()failed Returning an error code from .remove() makes the driver core emitthe little helpful error message: remove callback returned a non-zerovalue. This will be ignored. and then remove the device anyhow. So allresources that were not freed are leaked in this case. Skippingserial8250_unregister_port() has the potential to keep enough of the UARTaround to trigger a use-after-free. So replace the error return (and withit the little helpful error message) by a more useful error message andcontinue to cleanup.",
