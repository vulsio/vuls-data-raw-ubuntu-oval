		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validation Eachattribute inside a nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST is assumed to be a structifla_vf_vlan_info so the size of such attribute needs to be at least ofsizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes. The current sizevalidation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes) which is lessthan sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) so this validation is not enough anda too small attribute might be cast to a struct ifla_vf_vlan_info, thismight result in an out of bands read access when accessing the saved(casted) entry in ivvl.",
