    "Title": "CVE-2019-17563 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
    "Description": "When using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0 to 8.5.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-17563` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtomcat9-embed-java - 9.0.31-1\nlibtomcat9-java - 9.0.31-1\ntomcat9 - 9.0.31-1\ntomcat9-admin - 9.0.31-1\ntomcat9-common - 9.0.31-1\ntomcat9-examples - 9.0.31-1\ntomcat9-user - 9.0.31-1\nNo subscription required",
