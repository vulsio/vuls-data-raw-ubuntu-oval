		"description": "The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSAimplementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. Thisissue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect onsuch machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. Asa consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger aremote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLSservers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running onmachines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture areaffected by this issue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2274` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.4-1ubuntu1\nopenssl - 3.0.4-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
