    "Title": "CVE-2019-17546 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
    "Description": "tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10, as used in GDAL through 3.0.1 and other products, has an integer overflow that potentially causes a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted RGBA image, related to a \"Negative-size-param\" condition. It was discovered that GDAL incorrectly handled certain malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-17546` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtiff-opengl - 4.0.10+git191003-1\nlibtiff-tools - 4.0.10+git191003-1\nlibtiff6 - 4.0.10+git191003-1\nlibtiffxx6 - 4.0.10+git191003-1\nNo subscription required",
