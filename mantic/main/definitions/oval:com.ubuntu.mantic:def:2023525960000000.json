This checkevaluates the first element of the ctl_table. This results in an out ofbounds evaluation when registering empty directories.The function register_sysctl_mount_point now passes a ctl_table of size1 instead of size 0. It now relies solely on the type to identifya permanently empty register.Make sure that the ctl_table has at least one element before testing forpermanent emptiness.",
