		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/siw: Fix connection failure handlingIn case immediate MPA request processing fails, the newlycreated endpoint unlinks the listening endpoint and isready to be dropped. This special case was not handledcorrectly by the code handling the later TCP socket close,causing a NULL dereference crash in siw_cm_work_handler()when dereferencing a NULL listener. We now also cancelthe useless MPA timeout, if immediate MPA requestprocessing fails.This patch furthermore simplifies MPA processing in general:Scheduling a useless TCP socket read in sk_data_ready() upcallis now surpressed, if the socket is already moved out ofTCP_ESTABLISHED state.",
