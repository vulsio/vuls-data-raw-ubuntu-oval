		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay This mostlyreverts commit 6bd97bf273bd (\"ext4: remove redundantmb_regenerate_buddy()\") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based oncode in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as freeblocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of the buddybitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.",
