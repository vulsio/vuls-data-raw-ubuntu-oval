		"title": "CVE-2024-38519 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` are command-line audio/video downloaders. Priorto the fixed versions, `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` do not limit theextensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenamesbeing created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (andon Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl`directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.`yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowedextensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the`master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. Thismight mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, howeverit will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition toupgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make surethe user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, makesure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitivelocations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binarieslocations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default outputtemplate (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of themedia to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid thegeneric extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` tonot load config from common locations.",
