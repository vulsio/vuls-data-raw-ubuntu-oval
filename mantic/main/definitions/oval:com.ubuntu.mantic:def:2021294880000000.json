		"Title": "CVE-2021-29488 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "SABnzbd is an open source binary newsreader. A vulnerability was discovered in SABnzbd that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into writing downloaded files outside the configured Download Folder via malicious PAR2 files. A patch was released as part of SABnzbd 3.2.1RC1. As a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without PAR2 files, deny write permissions to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must access to perform its job, or update to a fixed version.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29488` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsabnzbdplus - 3.6.1+dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
