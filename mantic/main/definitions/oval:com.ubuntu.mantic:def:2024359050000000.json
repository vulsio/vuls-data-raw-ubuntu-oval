		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Protect against int overflow for stack access size This patch re-introducesprotection against the size of access to stack memory being negative; theaccess size can appear negative as a result of overflowing its signed intrepresentation. This should not actually happen, as there are otherprotections along the way, but we should protect against it anyway. Onecode path was missing such protections (fixed in the previous patch in theseries), causing out-of-bounds array accesses incheck_stack_range_initialized(). This patch causes the verification of aprogram with such a non-sensical access size to fail. This check used toexist in a more indirect way, but was inadvertendly removed ina833a17aeac7.",
