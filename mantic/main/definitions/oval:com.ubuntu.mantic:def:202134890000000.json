		"description": "The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did notcheck that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowingan attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the kernel andtherefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit4b81ccebaeee (\"bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf\")(v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, andv5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88 (\"bpf: Implement BPF ringbuffer and verifier support for it\") (v5.8-rc1).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3489` to fix the vulnerability.
