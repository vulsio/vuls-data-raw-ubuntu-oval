		"Title": "CVE-2021-3489 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
		"Description": "The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did not check that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowing an attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 4b81ccebaeee (\"bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf\") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88 (\"bpf: Implement BPF ring buffer and verifier support for it\") (v5.8-rc1). Ryota Shiga discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify that a BPF program only reserved as much memory for a ring buffer as was allocated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3489` to fix the vulnerability.
