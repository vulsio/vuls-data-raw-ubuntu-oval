		"title": "CVE-2024-38606 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:crypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FWThe function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL)feature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message tothe firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMAbuffer in memory and returns an array containing the number ofaccelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW.The pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data datastructure called slice_cnt.The array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data()to report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators.An incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an outof bounds memory read.At the moment, there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrongvalue, but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38606` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic-64k - 6.2.0-20.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-azure - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1003-laptop - 6.5.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi - 6.2.0-1004.5\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi-nolpae - 6.2.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-starfive - 6.5.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required",
