		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spmi:mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove The pmif driver data that contains theclocks is allocated along with spmi_controller. On device remove,spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres , including theclocks, will be cleanup. This leads to UAF because putting the clocks willaccess the clocks in the pmif driver data, which is already freed alongwith spmi_controller. This can be reproduced by enablingDEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and building the kernel with KASAN. Fix the UAFissue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the clocks beforefreeing spmi_controller.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52584` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic-64k - 6.5.0-41.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1021-aws - 6.5.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-azure - 6.5.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-gcp - 6.5.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1017-laptop - 6.5.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-oracle - 6.5.0-1024.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-oracle-64k - 6.5.0-1024.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1018-raspi - 6.5.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1015-starfive - 6.5.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required",
