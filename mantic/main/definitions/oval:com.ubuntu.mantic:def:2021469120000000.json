		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns Currently,tcp_allowed_congestion_control is global and writable; writing to it in anynet namespace will leak into all other net namespaces.tcp_available_congestion_control and tcp_allowed_congestion_control are theonly sysctls in ipv4_net_table (the per-netns sysctl table) with a NULLdata pointer; their handlers (proc_tcp_available_congestion_control andproc_allowed_congestion_control) have no other way of referencing a structnet. Thus, they operate globally. Because ipv4_net_table does not usedesignated initializers, there is no easy way to fix up this one \"bad\"table entry. However, the data pointer updating logic shouldn't be appliedto NULL pointers anyway, so we instead force these entries to be read-only.These sysctls used to exist in ipv4_table (init-net only), but they weremoved to the per-net ipv4_net_table, presumably without realizing thattcp_allowed_congestion_control was writable and thus introduced a leak.Because the intent of that commit was only to know (i.e. read) \"whichcongestion algorithms are available or allowed\", this read-only solutionshould be sufficient. The logic added in recent commit 31c4d2f160eb: (\"net:Ensure net namespace isolation of sysctls\") does not and cannot check forNULL data pointers, because other table entries (e.g./proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_log/) have .data=NULL but use other methods(.extra2) to access the struct net.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46912` to fix the vulnerability.
