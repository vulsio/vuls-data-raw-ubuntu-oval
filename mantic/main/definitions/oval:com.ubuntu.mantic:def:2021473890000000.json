		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_startDECOMMISSION the current SEV context if binding an ASID fails afterRECEIVE_START.  Per AMD's SEV API, RECEIVE_START generates a new guestcontext and thus needs to be paired with DECOMMISSION:     The RECEIVE_START command is the only command other than theLAUNCH_START     command that generates a new guest context and guest handle.The missing DECOMMISSION can result in subsequent SEV launch failures,as the firmware leaks memory and might not able to allocate more SEVguest contexts in the future.Note, LAUNCH_START suffered the same bug, but was previously fixed bycommit 934002cd660b (\"KVM: SVM: Call SEV Guest Decommission if ASIDbinding fails\").",
