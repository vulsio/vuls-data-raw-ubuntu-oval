Attackers could craftcertificate subjects containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Namethat would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, forexample, in order to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing thecertificate subject verification.Affected versions of Node.js that do notaccept multi-value Relative Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerableto such attacks themselves. However, third-party code that uses node'sambiguous presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.",
