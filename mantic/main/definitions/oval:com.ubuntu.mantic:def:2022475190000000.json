		"Title": "CVE-2022-47519 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_OPER_CHANNEL in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds write when parsing the channel list attribute from Wi-Fi management frames. It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate specific attributes, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-47519` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-azure - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-azure - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
