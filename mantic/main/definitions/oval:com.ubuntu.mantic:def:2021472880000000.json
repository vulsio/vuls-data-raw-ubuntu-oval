		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: ngene: Fix out-of-bounds bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf()Fix an 11-year old bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() whileaddressing the following warnings caught with -Warray-bounds:arch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:22:16: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset[12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referencedsubobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset[12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referencedsubobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]The problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes ofdata into a one-byte size member _config_ of the wrong structueFW_CONFIGURE_BUFFERS, in a single call to memcpy(). This causes alegitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the lengthof &com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config. It seems that the rightstructure is FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains6 more members apart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name ofthe function ngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actualintention is to ConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers(which takes place in the function ngene_command_config_buf(), above).Fix this by enclosing those 6 members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERSinto new struct config, and use &com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config asthe destination address, instead of &com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config,when calling memcpy().This also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable-Warray-bounds and get us closer to being able to tighten theFORTIFY_SOURCE routines on memcpy().",
