		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers Colin reported beforepossible overflow and sign extension problems in io_provide_buffers_prep().As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing useful, see d81269fecb8ce(\"io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension\"). Do that with help ofcheck_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct io_provide_buf::len type, as itdoesn't make much sense to keep it signed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47040` to fix the vulnerability.
