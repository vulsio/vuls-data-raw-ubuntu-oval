		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface The Tx queueswere not disabled in situations where the driver needed to stop theinterface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a kernel panicwhen doing any of the 3 following actions: * reconfiguring the number ofqueues (ethtool -L) * reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool-G) * installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp) Preventthe panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping aninterface. Without this patch, the following kernel panic can be observedwhen doing any of the actions above: Unable to handle kernel paging requestat virtual address ffff80001238d040 [....] Call trace:dwmac4_set_addr+0x8/0x10 dev_hard_start_xmit+0xe4/0x1acsch_direct_xmit+0xe8/0x39c __dev_queue_xmit+0x3ec/0xaf0dev_queue_xmit+0x14/0x20 [...] [ end trace 0000000000000002 ]---",
