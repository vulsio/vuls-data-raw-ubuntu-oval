		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:enic: Validate length of nl attributes in enic_set_vf_portenic_set_vf_port assumes that the nl attribute IFLA_PORT_PROFILEis of length PORT_PROFILE_MAX and that the nl attributesIFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID, IFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID are of length PORT_UUID_MAX.These attributes are validated (in the function do_setlink in rtnetlink.c)using the nla_policy ifla_port_policy. The policy defines IFLA_PORT_PROFILEas NLA_STRING, IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID as NLA_BINARY andIFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID as NLA_STRING. That means that the length validationusing the policy is for the max size of the attributes and not on exactsize so the length of these attributes might be less than the sizes thatenic_set_vf_port expects. This might cause an out of bandsread access in the memcpys of the data of theseattributes in enic_set_vf_port.",
