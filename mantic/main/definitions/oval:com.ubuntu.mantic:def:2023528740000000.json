		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/tdx: Zero out the missing RSI in TDX_HYPERCALL macroIn the TDX_HYPERCALL asm, after the TDCALL instruction returns from theuntrusted VMM, the registers that the TDX guest shares to the VMM needto be cleared to avoid speculative execution of VMM-provided values.RSI is specified in the bitmap of those registers, but it is missingwhen zeroing out those registers in the current TDX_HYPERCALL.It was there when it was originally added in commit 752d13305c78(\"x86/tdx: Expand __tdx_hypercall() to handle more arguments\"), but waslater removed in commit 1e70c680375a (\"x86/tdx: Do not corruptframe-pointer in __tdx_hypercall()\"), which was correct because %rsi islater restored in the \"pop %rsi\".  However a later commit 7a3a401874be(\"x86/tdx: Drop flags from __tdx_hypercall()\") removed that \"pop %rsi\"but forgot to add the \"xor %rsi, %rsi\" back.Fix by adding it back.",
