		"Title": "CVE-2022-42329 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329). It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend driver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42329` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
