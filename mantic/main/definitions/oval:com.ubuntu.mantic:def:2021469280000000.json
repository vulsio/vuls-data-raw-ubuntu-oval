		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: parisc:Clear stale IIR value on instruction access rights trap When a trap 7(Instruction access rights) occurs, this means the CPU couldn't execute aninstruction due to missing execute permissions on the memory region. Inthis case it seems the CPU didn't even fetched the instruction from memoryand thus did not store it in the cr19 (IIR) register before calling thetrap handler. So, the trap handler will find some random old stale value incr19. This patch simply overwrites the stale IIR value with a constantmagic \"bad food\" value (0xbaadf00d), in the hope people don't start to tryto understand the various random IIR values in trap 7 dumps.",
