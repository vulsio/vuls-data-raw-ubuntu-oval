		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race The SGX EPCreclaimer (ksgxd) may reclaim the SECS EPC page for an enclave and setsecs.epc_page to NULL. The SECS page is used for EAUG and ELDU in the SGXpage fault handler. However, the NULL check for secs.epc_page is only donefor ELDU, not EAUG before being used. Fix this by doing the same NULL checkand reloading of the SECS page as needed for both EAUG and ELDU. The SECSpage holds global enclave metadata. It can only be reclaimed when there areno other enclave pages remaining. At that point, virtually nothing can bedone with the enclave until the SECS page is paged back in. An enclave cannot run nor generate page faults without a resident SECS page. But it isstill possible for a #PF for a non-SECS page to race with paging out theSECS page: when the last resident non-SECS page A triggers a #PF in anon-resident page B, and then page A and the SECS both are paged out beforethe #PF on B is handled. Hitting this bug requires that race triggered witha #PF for EAUG. Following is a trace when it happens.
