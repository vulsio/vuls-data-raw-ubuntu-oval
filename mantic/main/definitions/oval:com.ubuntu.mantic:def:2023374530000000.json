		"Title": "CVE-2023-37453 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel through 6.4.2. There is an out-of-bounds and crash in read_descriptors in drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c. It was discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition while handling device descriptors in certain situations, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-37453` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.5.0-6.6\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.5.0-6.6\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 6.5.0-6.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.5.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.5.0-6.6\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.5.0-6.6\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 6.5.0-6.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.5.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required",
