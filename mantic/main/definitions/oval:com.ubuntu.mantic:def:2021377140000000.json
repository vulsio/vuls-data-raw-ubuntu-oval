This effect may support a denial of service attack. The issue ispatched in version 1.14.2. There are a few available workarounds. Users mayrate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on systemresources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parseruntimes.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-37714` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjsoup-java - 1.15.2-1\nNo subscription required",
