		"Title": "CVE-2022-4510 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins. This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py. This issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4510` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbinwalk - 2.3.4+dfsg1-1\npython3-binwalk - 2.3.4+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
