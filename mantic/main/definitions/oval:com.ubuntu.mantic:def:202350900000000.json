		"Title": "CVE-2023-5090 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in KVM. An improper check in svm_set_x2apic_msr_interception() may allow direct access to host x2apic msrs when the guest resets its apic, potentially leading to a denial of service condition. Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-5090` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-13.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-laptop - 6.5.0-1006.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 6.5.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-13.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1004-starfive - 6.5.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required",
