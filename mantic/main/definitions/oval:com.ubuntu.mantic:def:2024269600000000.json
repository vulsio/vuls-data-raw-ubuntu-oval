		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff() There waspreviously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and teardown aswap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was running inanother thread. This could cause, amongst other bad possibilities,swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by free_swap_and_cache()) to accessthe freed memory for swap_map. This is a theoretical problem and I haven'tbeen able to provoke it from a test case. But there has been agreementbased on code review that this is possible (see link below). Fix it byusing get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall swapoff().There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that the swap entrywas not free. This isn't present in get_swap_device() because it doesn'tmake sense in general due to the race between getting the reference andswapoff. So I've added an equivalent check directly infree_swap_and_cache(). Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanksto David Hildenbrand for deriving this): --8<----- __swap_entry_free()might be the last user and result in \"count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE\".swapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0. Sothe question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turnsi->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages arestill references by swap entries. Process 1 still references subpage 0 viaswap entry. Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry. Process 1quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache(). -> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE [then,preempted in the hypervisor etc.] Process 2 quits. Callsfree_swap_and_cache(). -> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE Process 2 goes ahead,passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls __try_to_reclaim_swap().__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->swap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()-> ... WRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages,si->inuse_pages - nr_entries); What stops swapoff to succeed after process2 reclaimed the swap cache but before process1 finished its call toswap_page_trans_huge_swapped()? --8<-----",
