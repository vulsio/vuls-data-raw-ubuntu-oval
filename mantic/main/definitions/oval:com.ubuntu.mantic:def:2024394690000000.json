		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errorsThe error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page readfails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if thefolio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falselydetermine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system.In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on afailed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loopwith I/O if i_size of the directory's inode is also corrupted, causing thelog writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot.Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a falsevalue (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.",
