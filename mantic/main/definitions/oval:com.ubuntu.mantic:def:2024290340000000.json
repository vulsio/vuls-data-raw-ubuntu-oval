This vulnerability is caused by the fact that when uploading toobject storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Typevalue that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowedby `content_type_allowlist`, by providing multiple values separated bycommas. This bypassed value can be used to cause XSS. Upgrade to 3.0.7 or2.2.6.",
