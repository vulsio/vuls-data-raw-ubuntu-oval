		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tls: fix race between async notify and socket closeThe submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg)may exit as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete()so any code past that point risks touching already freed data.Try to avoid the locking and extra flags altogether.Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this waywe can depend solely on the atomic ref counter forsynchronization.Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we are nowtightly controlling when completion fires.",
