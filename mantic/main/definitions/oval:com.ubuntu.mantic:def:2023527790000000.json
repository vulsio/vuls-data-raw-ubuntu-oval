		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs:Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface function Whenvfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface function thenthe 'nosec' should propagate into this function so that vfs_getattr_nosec()can again be called from the filesystem's gettattr rather thanvfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary security checks that theinitial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid. Therefore, introduce thegetattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass with the new getattr_flagsparameter to the getattr interface function. In overlayfs and ecryptfs usethis flag to determine which one of the two functions to call. In a recentcode change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up callingvfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn called security_inode_getattr()on an exiting process that did not have current->fs set anymore, which thencaused a kernel NULL pointer dereference. With this change the call tosecurity_inode_getattr() can be avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointerdereference.",
