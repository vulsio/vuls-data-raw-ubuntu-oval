		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: NTB:fix possible name leak in ntb_register_device() If device_register() failsin ntb_register_device(), the device name allocated by dev_set_name()should be freed. As per the comment in device_register(), callers shoulduse put_device() to give up the reference in the error path. So fix this bycalling put_device() in the error path so that the name can be freed inkobject_cleanup(). As a result of this, put_device() in the error path ofntb_register_device() is removed and the actual error is returned. [mani:reworded commit message]",
