		"description": "pdm is a Python package and dependency manager supporting the latest PEPstandards. It's possible to craft a malicious `pdm.lock` file that couldallow e.g. an insider or a malicious open source project to appear todepend on a trusted PyPI project, but actually install another project. Aproject `foo` can be targeted by creating the project `foo-2` and uploadingthe file `foo-2-2.tar.gz` to pypi.org. PyPI will see this as project`foo-2` version `2`, while PDM will see this as project `foo` version`2-2`. The version must only be `parseable as a version` and the filenamemust be a prefix of the project name, but it's not verified to match theversion being installed. Version `2-2` is also not a valid normalizedversion per PEP 440. Matching the project name exactly (not just prefix)would fix the issue. When installing dependencies with PDM, what's actuallyinstalled could differ from what's listed in `pyproject.toml` (includingarbitrary code execution on install). It could also be used for downgradeattacks by only changing the version. This issue has been addressed incommit `6853e2642df` which is included in release version `2.9.4`. Usersare advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for thisvulnerability.",
