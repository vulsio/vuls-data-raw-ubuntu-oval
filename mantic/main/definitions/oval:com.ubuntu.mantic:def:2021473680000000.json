		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:enetc: Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hintirq_set_affinity_hit() stores a reference to the cpumask_tparameter in the irq descriptor, and that reference can beaccessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Sincethe cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() hasonly temporary storage (it's on the stack memory), lateraccesses to it are illegal. Thus reads from the correspondingprocfs affinity_hint file can result in paging request oops.The issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, which providesa permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.",
