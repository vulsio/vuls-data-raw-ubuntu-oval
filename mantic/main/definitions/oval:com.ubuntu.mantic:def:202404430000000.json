		"title": "CVE-2024-0443 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the blkgs destruction path in block/blk-cgroup.c in theLinux kernel, leading to a cgroup blkio memory leakage problem. When acgroup is being destroyed, cgroup_rstat_flush() is only called atcss_release_work_fn(), which is called when the blkcg reference countreaches 0. This circular dependency will prevent blkcg and some blkgs frombeing freed after they are made offline. This issue may allow an attackerwith a local access to cause system instability, such as an out of memoryerror.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-0443` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic-64k - 6.5.0-5.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-aws - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-azure - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-gcp - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1003-laptop - 6.5.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-oracle - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-raspi - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-starfive - 6.5.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required",
