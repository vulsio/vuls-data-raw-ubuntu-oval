		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and.set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is buggy,so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver providesonly _one_ of the callbacks results in a NULL pointer dereference insteadof an -EOPNOTSUPP. Fix the condition so that the availability of bothcallbacks is ensured. This also matches the netlink code. Note thatreproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the legacy ioctlpath, and needs a specific combination of driver options: - have.get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no .set_coalesce(), or - have.set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn't cause thecrash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce() and bails out onerror.",
