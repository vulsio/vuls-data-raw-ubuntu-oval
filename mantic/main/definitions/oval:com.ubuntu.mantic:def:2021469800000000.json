		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:typec: ucsi: Retrieve all the PDOs instead of just the first 4 commit4dbc6a4ef06d (\"usb: typec: ucsi: save power data objects in PD mode\")introduced retrieval of the PDOs when connected to a PD-capable source. Butonly the first 4 PDOs are received since that is the maximum number thatcan be fetched at a time given the MESSAGE_IN length limitation (16 bytes).However, as per the PD spec a connected source may advertise up to amaximum of 7 PDOs. If such a source is connected it's possible the PPMcould have negotiated a power contract with one of the PDOs at indexgreater than 4, and would be reflected in the request data object's (RDO)object position field. This would result in an out-of-bounds access whenthe rdo_index() is used to index into the src_pdos array inucsi_psy_get_voltage_now(). With the help of the UBSAN-fsanitize=array-bounds checker enabled this exact issue is revealed whenconnecting to a PD source adapter that advertise 5 PDOs and the PPM entersa contract having selected the 5th one.
