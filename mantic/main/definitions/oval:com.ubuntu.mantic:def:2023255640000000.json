		"Description": "GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implementsNTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, memory corruption can betriggered when decoding UTF16 strings. The variable `outlen` was notinitialized and could cause writing a zero to an arbitrary place in memoryif `ntlm_str_convert()` were to fail, which would leave `outlen`uninitialized. This can lead to a denial of service if the write hitsunmapped memory or randomly corrupts a byte in the application memoryspace. This vulnerability can trigger an out-of-bounds write, leading tomemory corruption. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main`gss_accept_sec_context` entry point. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.",
