I can be wrong in my assumption but, at least, the reproducer available in the the-webp-0day blog post, reproduces in 0.5.0 but not in 0.4.4, and the buffer huffman_tables was added in the mentioned commit. in Ubuntu, libwebp versions earlier than 0.5.0 does not contain the affected code, hence are probably not affected."
