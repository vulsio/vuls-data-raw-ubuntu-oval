		"Title": "CVE-2021-31916 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel before 5.12. A bound check failure allows an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-31916` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required",
