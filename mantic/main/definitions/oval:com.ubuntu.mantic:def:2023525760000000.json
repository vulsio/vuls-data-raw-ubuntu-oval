		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/mm,kexec, ima: Use memblock_free_late() from ima_free_kexec_buffer() The codecalling ima_free_kexec_buffer() runs long after the memblock allocator hasalready been torn down, potentially resulting in a use after free inmemblock_isolate_range(). With KASAN or KFENCE, this use after free willresult in a BUG from the idle task, and a subsequent kernel panic. Switchima_free_kexec_buffer() over to memblock_free_late() to avoid that bug.",
