		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: erofs:fix inconsistent per-file compression format EROFS can select compressionalgorithms on a per-file basis, and each per-file compression algorithmneeds to be marked in the on-disk superblock for initialization. However,syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted images that use an unsupportedalgorithmtype for specific inodes, e.g. use MicroLZMA algorithmtype evenit's not set in `sbi->available_compr_algs`. This can lead to an unexpected\"BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference\" if the corresponding decompressorisn't built-in. Fix this by checking against `sbi->available_compr_algs`for each m_algorithmformat request. Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgspreset bitmap is now fixed together since it was harmless previously.",
