		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tipc: improve size validations for received domain recordsThe function tipc_mon_rcv() allows a node to receive and processdomain_record structs from peer nodes to track their views of thenetwork topology.This patch verifies that the number of members in a received domainrecord does not exceed the limit defined by MAX_MON_DOMAIN, somethingthat may otherwise lead to a stack overflow.tipc_mon_rcv() is called from the function tipc_link_proto_rcv(), wherewe are reading a 32 bit message data length field into a uint16.  Toavert any risk of bit overflow, we add an extra sanity check for this inthat function.  We cannot see that happen with the current code, butfuture designers being unaware of this risk, may introduce it byallowing delivery of very large (> 64k) sk buffers from the bearerlayer.  This potential problem was identified by Eric Dumazet.This fixes CVE-2022-0435",
