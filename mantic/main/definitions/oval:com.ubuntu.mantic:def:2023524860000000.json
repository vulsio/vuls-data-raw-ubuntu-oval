		"title": "CVE-2023-52486 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm:Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling Ifwe get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl() weproceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top. But weforget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL, and so if we then get anothererror during the retry, before the fb lookup, we proceed the unref the samefb again without having gotten another reference. The end result is thatthe fb will (eventually) end up being freed while it's still in use. Resetfb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again until we've doneanother fb lookup. This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 whendoing async flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptomI saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking theframebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops instead,and from there it was easier to track down the culprit.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52486` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic-64k - 6.5.0-41.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-azure - 6.5.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-gcp - 6.5.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1018-raspi - 6.5.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1015-starfive - 6.5.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required",
