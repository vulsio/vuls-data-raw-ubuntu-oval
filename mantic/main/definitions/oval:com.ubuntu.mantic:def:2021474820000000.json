		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:batman-adv: fix error handling Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning inbatadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was in wrong error handling inbatadv_mesh_init(). Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was callingbatadv_mesh_free() in case of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. Thisapproach may work well, when there is some kind of indicator, which cantell which parts of batadv are initialized; but there isn't any. Allwritten above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hideODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hitGPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1] Tofix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one. It is goodapproach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling path 2) Itimproves the performance, since we won't call unneeded batadv_*_free()functions. So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocatedmemory before returning with an error to no call correspoingbatadv_*_free() and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order toavoid touching uninitialized fields.",
