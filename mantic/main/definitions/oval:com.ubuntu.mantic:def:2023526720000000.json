		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pipe: wakeup wr_wait after setting max_usageCommit c73be61cede5 (\"pipe: Add general notification queue support\") aregression was introduced that would lock up resized pipes under certainconditions. See the reproducer in [1].The commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a differentfunction, doing that moved the wakeup for pipe->wr_wait before actuallyraising pipe->max_usage. If a pipe was full before the resize occured itwould result in the wakeup never actually triggering pipe_write.Set @max_usage and @nr_accounted before waking writers if this isn't awatch queue.[Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>: rewrite to account for watchqueues]",
