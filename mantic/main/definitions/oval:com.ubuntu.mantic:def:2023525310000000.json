		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issueA few lines above, space is kzalloc()'ed for:\tsizeof(struct iwl_nvm_data) +\tsizeof(struct ieee80211_channel) +\tsizeof(struct ieee80211_rate)'mvm->nvm_data' is a 'struct iwl_nvm_data', so it is fine.At the end of this structure, there is the 'channels' flex array.Each element is of type 'struct ieee80211_channel'.So only 1 element is allocated in this array.When doing:  mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].channels = mvm->nvm_data->channels;We point at the first element of the 'channels' flex array.So this is fine.However, when doing:  mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].bitrates =\t\t\t(void *)((u8 *)mvm->nvm_data->channels + 1);because of the \"(u8 *)\" cast, we add only 1 to the address of the beginningof the flex array.It is likely that we want point at the 'struct ieee80211_rate' allocatedjust after.Remove the spurious casting so that the pointer arithmetic works asexpected.",
