		"Title": "CVE-2022-3625 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function devlink_param_set/devlink_param_get of the file net/core/devlink.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211929 was assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the Netlink device interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability with some network device drivers. A local attacker with admin access to the network device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3625` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 5.19.0-21.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 5.19.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 5.19.0-1004.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 5.19.0-21.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 5.19.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required",
