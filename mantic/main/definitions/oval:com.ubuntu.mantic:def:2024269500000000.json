		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer The previouscommit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer->device being dereferenced. It'sactually easier and faster performance-wise to instead get the device fromctx->wg. This semantically makes more sense too, sincectx->wg->peer_allowedips.seq is compared with ctx->allowedips_seq, basingthem both in ctx. This also acts as a defence in depth provision againstfreed peers.",
