		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:xsk: return xsk buffers back to pool when cleaning the ring Currently weonly NULL the xdp_buff pointer in the internal SW ring but we never give itback to the xsk buffer pool. This means that buffers can be leaked out ofthe buff pool and never be used again. Add missing xsk_buff_free() call tothe routine that is supposed to clean the entries that are left in the ringso that these buffers in the umem can be used by other sockets. Also, onlygo through the space that is actually left to be cleaned instead of a wholering.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47105` to fix the vulnerability.
