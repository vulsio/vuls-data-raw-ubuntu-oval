		"description": "The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, andREST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook,JupyterLab, and Voila. In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an openredirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect thebrowser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers runningwithout a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, thesemaliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyterserver hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, butultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This samevulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed injupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be torun your server on a url prefix: \"jupyter server--ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/\".\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26275` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njupyter-server - 1.18.1-1\npython3-jupyter-server - 1.18.1-1\nNo subscription required",
