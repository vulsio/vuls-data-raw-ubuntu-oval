		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srvFixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in thedc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up()functions.In both functions, the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferencedbefore it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointerdereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.Thus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of thefunctions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it isdereferenced.Found by smatch & thus fixing the below:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:133dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() warn: variable dereferenced beforecheck 'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 128)drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:1167dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() warn: variable dereferenced before check'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 1164)",
