		"title": "CVE-2023-39950 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "efibootguard is a simple UEFI boot loader with support for safely switchingbetween current and updated partition sets. Insufficient or missingvalidation and sanitization of input from untrustworthy bootloaderenvironment files can cause crashes and probably also code injections into`bg_setenv`) or programs using `libebgenv`. This is triggered when theaffected components try to modify a manipulated environment, in particularits user variables. Furthermore, `bg_printenv` may crash over invalid readaccesses or report invalid results. Not affected by this issue is EFI BootGuard's bootloader EFI binary. EFI Boot Guard release v0.15 containsrequired patches to sanitize and validate the bootloader environment priorto processing it in userspace. Its library and tools should be updated, soshould programs statically linked against it. An update of the bootloaderEFI executable is not required. The only way to prevent the issue with anunpatched EFI Boot Guard version is to avoid accesses to user variables,specifically modifications to them.",
