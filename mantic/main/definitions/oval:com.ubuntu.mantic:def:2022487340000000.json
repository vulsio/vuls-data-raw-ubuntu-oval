		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix deadlock between quota disable and qgroup rescan workerQuota disable ioctl starts a transaction before waiting for the qgrouprescan worker completes. However, this wait can be infinite and resultsin deadlock because of circular dependency among the quota disableioctl, the qgroup rescan worker and the other task with transaction suchas block group relocation task.The deadlock happens with the steps following:1) Task A calls ioctl to disable quota. It starts a transaction and   waits for qgroup rescan worker completes.2) Task B such as block group relocation task starts a transaction and   joins to the transaction that task A started. Then task B commits to   the transaction. In this commit, task B waits for a commit by task A.3) Task C as the qgroup rescan worker starts its job and starts a   transaction. In this transaction start, task C waits for completion   of the transaction that task A started and task B committed.This deadlock was found with fstests test case btrfs/115 and a zonednull_blk device. The test case enables and disables quota, and theblock group reclaim was triggered during the quota disable by chance.The deadlock was also observed by running quota enable and disable inparallel with 'btrfs balance' command on regular null_blk devices.An example report of the deadlock:  [372.469894] INFO: task kworker/u16:6:103 blocked for more than 122seconds.
