		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix possible null pointer derefence with invalid contextsvmw_context_cotable can return either an error or a null pointer and itsusage sometimes went unchecked. Subsequent code would then try to accesseither a null pointer or an error value.The invalid dereferences were only possible with malformed userspaceapps which never properly initialized the rendering contexts.Check the results of vmw_context_cotable to fix the invalid derefs.Thanks:ziming zhang(@ezrak1e) from Ant Group Light-Year Security Labwho was the first person to discover it.Niels De Graef who reported it and helped to track down the poc.",
