		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set element timeoutAdd a timestamp field at the beginning of the transaction, store itin the nftables per-netns area.Update set backend .insert, .deactivate and sync gc path to use thetimestamp, this avoids that an element expires while control planetransaction is still unfinished..lookup and .update, which are used from packet path, still use thecurrent time to check if the element has expired. And .get path and dumpalso since this runs lockless under rcu read size lock. Then, there isasync gc which also needs to check the current time since it runsasynchronously from a workqueue.",
