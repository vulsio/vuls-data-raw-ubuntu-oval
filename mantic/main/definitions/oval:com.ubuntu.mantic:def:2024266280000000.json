That means it's impossible that svm_range_bo_releaseis running concurrently. However, there is no good way to annotate this.To avoid the problem, take a BO reference insvm_range_schedule_evict_svm_bo instead of in the worker. That way it'simpossible for a BO to get freed while eviction work is pending and thecancel_work_sync call in svm_range_bo_release can be eliminated.v2: Use svm_bo_ref_unless_zero and explained why that's safe.
