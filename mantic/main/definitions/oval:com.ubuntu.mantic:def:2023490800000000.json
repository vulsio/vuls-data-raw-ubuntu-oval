		"Title": "CVE-2023-49080 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"Description": "The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, andREST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook,JupyterLab, and Voila. Unhandled errors in API requests coming from anauthenticated user include traceback information, which can include pathinformation. There is no known mechanism by which to trigger these errorswithout authentication, so the paths revealed are not consideredparticularly sensitive, given that the requesting user has arbitraryexecution permissions already in the same environment. A fix has beenintroduced in commit `0056c3aa52` which no longer includes tracebackinformation in JSON error responses. For compatibility, the traceback fieldis present, but always empty. This commit has been included in version2.11.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds forthis vulnerability.",
