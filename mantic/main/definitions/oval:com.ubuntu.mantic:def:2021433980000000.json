		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** Crypto++ (aka Cryptopp) 8.6.0 and earlier contains a timingleakage in MakePublicKey(). There is a clear correlation between executiontime and private key length, which may cause disclosure of the lengthinformation of the private key. This might allow attackers to conducttiming attacks. NOTE: this report is disputed by the vendor and multiplethird parties. The execution-time differences are intentional. A user maymake a choice of a longer key as a tradeoff between strength andperformance. In making this choice, the amount of information leaked to anadversary is of infinitesimal value.",
