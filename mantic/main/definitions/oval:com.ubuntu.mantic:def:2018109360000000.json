    "Description": "A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10936` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibpostgresql-jdbc-java - 42.4.2-1\nNo subscription required",
