		"Title": "CVE-2022-2196 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A regression exists in the Linux Kernel within KVM: nVMX that allowed for speculative execution attacks. L2 can carry out Spectre v2 attacks on L1 due to L1 thinking it doesn't need retpolines or IBPB after running L2 due to KVM (L0) advertising eIBRS support to L1. An attacker at L2 with code execution can execute code on an indirect branch on the host machine. We recommend upgrading to Kernel 6.2 or past commit 2e7eab81425a It was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2 VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2196` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 6.2.0-18.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-raspi - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 6.2.0-18.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
