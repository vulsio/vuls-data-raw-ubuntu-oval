		"Title": "CVE-2022-39251 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"Description": "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Priorto version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver canconstruct messages that legitimately appear to have come from anotherperson, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, asophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employthis vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send faketo-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This canallow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during aself-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious keybackup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to aprotocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encryptedwith Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0, matrix-js-sdk hasbeen modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out ofcaution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attackrequires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, sothose who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39251` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nthunderbird - 1:102.6.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:102.6.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:102.6.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:102.6.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:102.6.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:102.6.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
