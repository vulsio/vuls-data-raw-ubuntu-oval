		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath() While thiscode is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can acquire the lockwithout holding wait_lock. The writer side loops checking the value withthe atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly acquires the lock when thecompare-and-exchange is completed successfully which isnâ€™t ordered. Thisexposes the window between the acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problemwhich allows reads following the lock acquisition to observe valuesspeculatively before the write lock is truly acquired. We've seen a problemin epoll where the reader does a xchg while holding the read lock, but thewriter can see a value change out from under it. Writer | Reader--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ep_scan_ready_list() | |- write_lock_irq() | |-queued_write_lock_slowpath() | |- atomic_cond_read_acquire() | |read_lock_irqsave(&ep->lock, flags); --> (observes value before unlock) |chain_epi_lockless() | | epi->next = xchg(&ep->ovflist, epi); | |read_unlock_irqrestore(&ep->lock, flags); | | | atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed() ||-- READ_ONCE(ep->ovflist); | A core can order the read of the ovflistahead of the atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed(). Switching the cmpxchg to use acquiresemantics addresses this issue at which point the atomic_cond_read can beswitched to use relaxed semantics. [peterz: use try_cmpxchg()]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46921` to fix the vulnerability.
