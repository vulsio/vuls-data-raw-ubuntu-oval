		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: serial:8250_port: Check IRQ data before use In case the leaf driver wants to useIRQ polling (irq = 0) and IIR register shows that an interrupt happened inthe 8250 hardware the IRQ data can be NULL. In such a case we need to skipthe wake event as we came to this path from the timer interrupt and quitelikely system is already awake. Without this fix we have got an Oops:serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 0, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A...
