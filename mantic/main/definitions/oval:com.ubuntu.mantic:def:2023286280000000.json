		"description": "lambdaisland/uri is a pure Clojure/ClojureScript URI library. In versionsprior to 1.14.120 `authority-regex` allows an attacker to send maliciousURLs to be parsed by the `lambdaisland/uri` and return the wrong authority.This issue is similar to but distinct from CVE-2020-8910. The regex inquestion doesn't handle the backslash (`\\`) character in the usernamecorrectly, leading to a wrong output. ex. a payload of`https://example.com\\\\@google.com` would return that the host is`google.com`, but the correct host should be `example.com`. Given that thelibrary returns the wrong authority this may be abused to bypass hostrestrictions depending on how the library is used in an application. Usersare advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for thisvulnerability.",
