		"Title": "CVE-2022-3910 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
		"Description": "Use After Free vulnerability in Linux Kernel allows Privilege Escalation. An improper Update of Reference Count in io_uring leads to Use-After-Free and Local Privilege Escalation. When io_msg_ring was invoked with a fixed file, it called io_fput_file() which improperly decreased its reference count (leading to Use-After-Free and Local Privilege Escalation). Fixed files are permanently registered to the ring, and should not be put separately. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/fc7222c3a9f56271fba02aabbfbae999042f1679 https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/fc7222c3a9f56271fba02aabbfbae999042f1679 It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3910` to fix the vulnerability.
