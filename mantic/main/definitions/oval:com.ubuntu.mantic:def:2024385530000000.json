		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: fec: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocksThere is a deadlock issue found in sungem driver, please refer to thecommit ac0a230f719b (\"eth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoiddeadlocks\"). The root cause of the issue is that netpoll is in atomiccontext and disable_irq() is called by .ndo_poll_controller interfaceof sungem driver, however, disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzingthe implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should havethe same issue. Due to the fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the.ndo_poll_controller is unnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver,so fec_poll_controller() can be safely removed.",
