		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg addressCommit bd077259d0a9 (\"drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPSregister\") defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register addresseswith PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates the addressestill PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that case thefollowing macro works correctly to give correct register address:_MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4) However after PPS 11, the register addressfor PPS 12 increments by 12 because of RC Buffer memory allocation inbetween. Because of this discontinuity in the address space, the macrocalculates wrong addresses for PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPSparameter value read/writes causing DSC corruption. This fixes it bycorrecting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS >=12. v3: Add correctparanthesis for pps argument (Jani Nikula) (cherry picked from commit6074be620c31dc2ae11af96a1a5ea95580976fb5)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26721` to fix the vulnerability.
