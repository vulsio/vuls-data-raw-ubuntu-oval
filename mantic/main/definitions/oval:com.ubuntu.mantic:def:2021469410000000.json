		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3: core: Do core softreset when switch mode According to the programmingguide, to switch mode for DRD controller, the driver needs to do thefollowing. To switch from device to host: 1. Reset controller withGCTL.CoreSoftReset 2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(host mode) 3. Reset the host withUSBCMD.HCRESET 4. Then follow up with the initializing host registerssequence To switch from host to device: 1. Reset controller withGCTL.CoreSoftReset 2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(device mode) 3. Reset the devicewith DCTL.CSftRst 4. Then follow up with the initializing registerssequence Currently we're missing step 1) to do GCTL.CoreSoftReset and step3) of switching from host to device. John Stult reported a lockup issueseen with HiKey960 platform without these steps[1]. Similar issue isobserved with Ferry's testing platform[2]. So, apply the required stepsalong with some fixes to Yu Chen's and John Stultz's version. The mainfixes to their versions are the missing wait for clocks synchronizationbefore clearing GCTL.CoreSoftReset and only apply DCTL.CSftRst whenswitching from host to device.
