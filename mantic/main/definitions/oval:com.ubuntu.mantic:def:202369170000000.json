		"title": "CVE-2023-6917 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)package, stemming from the mixed privilege levels utilized by systemdservices associated with PCP. While certain services operate within theconfines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted full rootprivileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privilegedroot processes interact with directories or directory trees owned byunprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this vulnerability may lead to thecompromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits,particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore theimportance of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCPto mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation.",
