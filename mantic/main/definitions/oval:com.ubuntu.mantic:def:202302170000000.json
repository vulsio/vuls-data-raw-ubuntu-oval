		"title": "CVE-2023-0217 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an applicationtries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check()function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This functioncan be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which couldallow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The TLSimplementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but applicationsmight call the function if there are additional security requirementsimposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0217` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.8-1ubuntu1\nopenssl - 3.0.8-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
