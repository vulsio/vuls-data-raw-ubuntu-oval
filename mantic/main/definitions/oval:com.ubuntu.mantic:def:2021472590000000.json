		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:NFS: Fix use-after-free in nfs4_init_client()KASAN reports a use-after-free when attempting to mount two differentexports through two different NICs that belong to the same server.Olga was able to hit this with kernels starting somewhere between 5.7and 5.10, but I traced the patch that introduced the clear_bit() call to4.13. So something must have changed in the refcounting of the clppointer to make this call to nfs_put_client() the very last one.",
