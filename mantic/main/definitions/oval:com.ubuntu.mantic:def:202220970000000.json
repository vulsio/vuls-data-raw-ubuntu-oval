		"description": "AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimisedimplementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under somecircumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexistingin the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\"encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSLdoes not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are bothunaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2097` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.5-2ubuntu1\nopenssl - 3.0.5-2ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
