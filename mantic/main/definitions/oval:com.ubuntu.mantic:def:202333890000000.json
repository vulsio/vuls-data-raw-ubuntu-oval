		"Title": "CVE-2023-3389 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring subsystem can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Racing a io_uring cancel poll request with a linked timeout can cause a UAF in a hrtimer. We recommend upgrading past commit ef7dfac51d8ed961b742218f526bd589f3900a59 (4716c73b188566865bdd79c3a6709696a224ac04 for 5.10 stable and 0e388fce7aec40992eadee654193cad345d62663 for 5.15 stable). Querijn Voet discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3389` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic-64k - 6.5.0-5.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-aws - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-azure - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-gcp - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-oracle - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-raspi - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic-64k - 6.5.0-5.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-aws - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-azure - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-gcp - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-oracle - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-starfive - 6.5.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required",
