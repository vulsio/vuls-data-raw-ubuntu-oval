    "Title": "CVE-2022-39188 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs. Jann Horn discovered a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when unmapping VMAs in certain situations, resulting in possible use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-39188` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.19.0-21.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.19.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-raspi - 5.19.0-1004.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.19.0-21.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.19.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required",
