		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp We recently added somevalidation that we don't try to connect to an AP that is currently in achannel switch process, since that might want the channel to be quiet or wemight not be able to connect in time to hear the switching in a beacon.This was in commit c09c4f31998b (\"wifi: mac80211: don't connect to an APwhile it's in a CSA process\"). However, we promptly got a report that thiscaused new connection failures, and it turns out that the AP that we nowcannot connect to is permanently advertising an extended channel switchannouncement, even with quiet. The AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, withfirmware 3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898. As a first step, attempt to detectthat we're dealing with such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26683` to fix the vulnerability.
