		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/lib: Validate size for vector operations Some of the fp/vmx code insstep.c assume a certain maximum size for the instructions being emulated.The size of those operations however is determined separately inanalyse_instr(). Add a check to validate the assumption on the maximum sizeof the operations, so as to prevent any unintended kernel stack corruption.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52606` to fix the vulnerability.
