    "Title": "CVE-2023-3090 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
    "Description": "A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb->cb initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled. We recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e. It was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3090` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
