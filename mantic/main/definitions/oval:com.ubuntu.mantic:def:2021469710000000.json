		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf/core: Fix unconditional security_locked_down() call Currently, thelockdown state is queried unconditionally, even though its result is usedonly if the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR bit is set in attr.sample_type. Whilethat doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown LSM, it causes trouble with theSELinux's lockdown hook implementation. SELinux implements the locked_downhook with a check whether the current task's type has the corresponding\"lockdown\" class permission (\"integrity\" or \"confidentiality\") allowed inthe policy. This means that calling the hook when the access controldecision would be ignored generates a bogus permission check and auditrecord. Fix this by checking sample_type first and only calling the hookwhen its result would be honored.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46971` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic-64k - 6.2.0-20.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-azure - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1003-laptop - 6.5.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi - 6.2.0-1004.5\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi-nolpae - 6.2.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-starfive - 6.5.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required",
