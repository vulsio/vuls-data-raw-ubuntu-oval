		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf/core: Fix unconditional security_locked_down() callCurrently, the lockdown state is queried unconditionally, even thoughits result is used only if the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR bit is set inattr.sample_type. While that doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown LSM,it causes trouble with the SELinux's lockdown hook implementation.SELinux implements the locked_down hook with a check whether the currenttask's type has the corresponding \"lockdown\" class permission(\"integrity\" or \"confidentiality\") allowed in the policy. This meansthat calling the hook when the access control decision would be ignoredgenerates a bogus permission check and audit record.Fix this by checking sample_type first and only calling the hook whenits result would be honored.",
