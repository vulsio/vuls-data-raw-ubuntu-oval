		"Title": "CVE-2023-39189 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The nfnl_osf_add_callback function did not validate the user mode controlled opt_num field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure. Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39189` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-14.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-laptop - 6.5.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 6.5.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-14.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1004-starfive - 6.5.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required",
