		"description": "crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard.This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithmconsidered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one singleiteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 whenspecified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure topreimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact ishigh. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js touse SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.",
