		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: hwrng:core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng There is a dead-lock inthe hwrng device read path. This triggers when the user reads from/dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from /dev/hwrng. The resulting pagefault triggers a recursive read which then dead-locks. Fix this by using astack buffer when calling copy_to_user.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52615` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-35-generic - 6.5.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-35-generic - 6.5.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-35-generic-64k - 6.5.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1020-aws - 6.5.0-1020.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1021-azure - 6.5.0-1021.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1020-gcp - 6.5.0-1020.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1016-laptop - 6.5.0-1016.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-35-lowlatency - 6.5.0-35.35.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-35.35.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1023-oracle - 6.5.0-1023.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1023-oracle-64k - 6.5.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1017-raspi - 6.5.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1014-starfive - 6.5.0-1014.15\nNo subscription required",
