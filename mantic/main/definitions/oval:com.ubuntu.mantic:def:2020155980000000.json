		"description": "** DISPUTED ** Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial ofservice via a special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports \"Trustwave hassignaled they are disputing our claims.\" The CVE suggests that there is asecurity issue with how ModSecurity handles regular expressions that canresult in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not consider thisas a security issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here.An attacker would need to know that a rule using a potentially problematicregular expression was in place, 2) the attacker would need to know thebasic nature of the regular expression itself to exploit any resourceissues. It's well known that regular expression usage can be taxing onsystem resources regardless of the use case. It is up to the administratorto decide on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potentialsecurity benefit.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-15598` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmodsecurity3 - 3.0.4-2\nNo subscription required",
