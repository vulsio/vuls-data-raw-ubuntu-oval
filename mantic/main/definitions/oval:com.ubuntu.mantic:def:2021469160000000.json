		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ixgbe:Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test The ixgbe drivercurrently generates a NULL pointer dereference when performing the ethtoolloopback test. This is due to the fact that there isn't a q_vectorassociated with the test ring when it is setup as interrupts are notnormally added to the test rings. To address this I have added code thatwill check for a q_vector before returning a napi_id value. If a q_vectoris not present it will return a value of 0.",
