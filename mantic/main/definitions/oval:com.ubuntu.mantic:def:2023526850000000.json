		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pstore:ram_core: fix possible overflow in persistent_ram_init_ecc() Inpersistent_ram_init_ecc(), on 64-bit arches DIV_ROUND_UP() will return64-bit value since persistent_ram_zone::buffer_size has type size_t whichis derived from the 64-bit *unsigned long*, while the ecc_blocks variablethis value gets assigned to has (always 32-bit) *int* type. Even if thatvalue fits into *int* type, an overflow is still possible when calculatingthe size_t typed ecc_total variable further below since there's no cast toany 64-bit type before multiplication. Declaring the ecc_blocks variable as*size_t* should fix this mess... Found by Linux Verification Center(linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static analysis tool.",
