		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: Fix potential out-of-bounds access in'amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init()'The issue arises when the array 'adev->vcn.vcn_config' is accessedbefore checking if the index 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' is within thebounds of the array.The fix involves moving the bounds check before the array access. Thisensures that 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' is within the bounds of the arraybefore it is used as an index.Fixes the below:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_discovery.c:1289amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init() error: testing array offset'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' after use.",
