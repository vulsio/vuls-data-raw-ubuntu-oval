    "Title": "CVE-2023-33203 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before 6.2.9 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in drivers/net/ethernet/qualcomm/emac/emac.c if a physically proximate attacker unplugs an emac based device. It was discovered that the Qualcomm EMAC ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-33203` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required",
