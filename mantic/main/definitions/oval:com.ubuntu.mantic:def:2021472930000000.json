		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_skbmod: Skip non-Ethernet packets Currently tcf_skbmod_act()assumes that packets use Ethernet as their L2 protocol, which is not alwaysthe case. As an example, for CAN devices: $ ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan$ ip link set up vcan0 $ tc qdisc add dev vcan0 root handle 1: htb $ tcfilter add dev vcan0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 10 \\ matchall action skbmodswap mac Doing the above silently corrupts all the packets. Do not performskbmod actions for non-Ethernet packets.",
