		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fuse:clear FR_SENT when re-adding requests into pending list The followingwarning was reported by lee bruce: ------------[ cut here ]------------WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 8264 at fs/fuse/dev.c:300 fuse_request_end+0x685/0x7e0fs/fuse/dev.c:300 Modules linked in: CPU: 0 PID: 8264 Comm: ab2 Not tainted6.9.0-rc7 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996) RIP:0010:fuse_request_end+0x685/0x7e0 fs/fuse/dev.c:300 ......

During the read, bit FR_SENT willbe set on the request. (2) calls fuse_dev_write() to send anUSE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify The resend notify will resend all processingrequests, so the INIT request is moved from processing list to pending listagain. (3) calls fuse_dev_read() with an invalid output addressfuse_dev_read() will try to copy the same INIT request to the outputaddress, but it will fail due to the invalid address, so the INIT requestis ended and triggers the warning in fuse_request_end(). Fix it by clearingFR_SENT when re-adding requests into pending list.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38626` to fix the vulnerability.
