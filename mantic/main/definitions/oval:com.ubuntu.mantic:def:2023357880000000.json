		"Title": "CVE-2023-35788 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation. Hangyu Hua discovered that the Flower classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-35788` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic-64k - 6.5.0-5.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-aws - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-azure - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-gcp - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-oracle - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-raspi - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic - 6.5.0-5.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-generic-64k - 6.5.0-5.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-aws - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-azure - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1004-gcp - 6.5.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-5-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-5.5.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1005-oracle - 6.5.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-starfive - 6.5.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required",
