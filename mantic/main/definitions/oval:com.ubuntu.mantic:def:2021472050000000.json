		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: clk:sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding Currently, unbinding aCCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region, while leaving its clocks/resetsand their providers registered. This can cause a page fault later when someclock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix this by separating the CCUinitialization from the memory allocation, and then using a devres callbackto unregister the clocks and resets. This also fixes a memory leak of the`struct ccu_reset`, and uses the correct owner (the specific platformdriver) for the clocks and resets. Early OF clock providers are neverunregistered, and limited error handling is possible, so they are mostlyunchanged. The error reporting is made more consistent by moving themessage inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.",
