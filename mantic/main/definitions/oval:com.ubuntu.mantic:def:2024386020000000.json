		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ax25: Fix reference count leak issues of ax25_devThe ax25_addr_ax25dev() and ax25_dev_device_down() exist a referencecount leak issue of the object \"ax25_dev\".Memory leak issue in ax25_addr_ax25dev():The reference count of the object \"ax25_dev\" can be increased multipletimes in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). This will cause a memory leak.Memory leak issues in ax25_dev_device_down():The reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 in ax25_dev_device_up() andthen increase the reference count when ax25_dev is added to ax25_dev_list.As a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2. But when the device isshutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count onceor twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will causememory leak.As for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), it is impossible for one pointerto be on a list twice. So add a break in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for theissue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increase the reference count of ax25_devonce in ax25_dev_device_up() and decrease the reference count of ax25_devafter it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.",
