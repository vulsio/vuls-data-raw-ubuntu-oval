		"Title": "CVE-2020-25645 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Traffic between two Geneve endpoints may be unencrypted when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel allowing anyone between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. It was discovered that the GENEVE tunnel implementation in the Linux kernel when combined with IPSec did not properly select IP routes in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (unencrypted network traffic).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-25645` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required",
