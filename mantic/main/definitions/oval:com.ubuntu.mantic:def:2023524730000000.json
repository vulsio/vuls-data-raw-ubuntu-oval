		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal: core: Fix NULL pointer dereference in zone registration error pathIf device_register() in thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips() returnsan error, the tz variable is set to NULL and subsequently dereferenced inkfree(tz->tzp). Commit adc8749b150c (\"thermal/drivers/core: Useput_device() if device_register() fails\") added the tz = NULL assignment inquestion to avoid a possible double-free after dropping the reference tothe zone device. However, after commit 4649620d9404 (\"thermal: core: Makethermal_zone_device_unregister() return after freeing the zone\"), thatassignment has become redundant, because dropping the reference to the zonedevice does not cause the zone object to be freed any more. Drop it toaddress the NULL pointer dereference.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52473` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic-64k - 6.5.0-41.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-azure - 6.5.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-gcp - 6.5.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1018-raspi - 6.5.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1015-starfive - 6.5.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required",
