		"description": "TZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone data and allowstimes to be converted using time zone rules. Versions prior to 0.36.1, aswell as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data sourcetzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby datasource, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per timezone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affectedversions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifierscorrectly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Rubyversion 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to loadunintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process.Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zoneidentifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their namefollows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has aprefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path.Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in adirectory on the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier canbe validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring itmatches the regular expression`\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+)*\\z`.",
