		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handlerInside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked with hostlock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as: - N hardware queues -queue depth is M for each hardware queue - each scsi_host_busy() iteratesover (N * M) tag/requests If recovery is triggered in case that allrequests are in-flight, each scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, whenscsi_eh_wakeup() is called for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy()has been run for (N * M - 1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M- 1) * (N * M) times. If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can betriggered on acquiring host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hwqueues, queue depth 8169). Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy()outside the host lock. We don't need the host lock for getting busy countbecause host the lock never covers that.
