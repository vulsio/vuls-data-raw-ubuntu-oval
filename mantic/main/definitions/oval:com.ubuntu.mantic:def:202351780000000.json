		"Title": "CVE-2023-5178 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution or lead to local privilege escalation in case that the attacker already has local privileges. Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-5178` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-14.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-laptop - 6.5.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 6.5.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-14.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-14.14.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1004-starfive - 6.5.0-1005.6\nNo subscription required",
