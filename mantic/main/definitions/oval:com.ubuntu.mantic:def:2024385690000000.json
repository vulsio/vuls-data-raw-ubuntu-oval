		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers/perf: hisi_pcie: Fix out-of-bound access when valid event groupThe perf tool allows users to create event groups through followingcmd [1], but the driver does not check whether the array index is out ofbounds when writing data to the event_group array. If the number of eventsin an event_group is greater than HISI_PCIE_MAX_COUNTERS, the memory writeoverflow of event_group array occurs.Add array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation,and return directly when write new events are written to array bounds.There are 9 different events in an event_group.[1] perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}'",
