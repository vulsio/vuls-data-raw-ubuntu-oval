		"title": "CVE-2023-34324 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock.This happens when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelatedXen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt in anunprivileged guest. The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered byremoval of a paravirtual device on the other side. As this action willcause console messages to be issued on the other side quite often, thechance of triggering the deadlock is not neglectable. Note that 32-bitArm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernel on Arm doesn't usequeued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the issue (on Arm32 awaiting writer doesn't block further readers to get the lock).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-34324` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-17-generic - 6.5.0-17.17\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-generic - 6.5.0-17.17\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-generic-64k - 6.5.0-17.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1013-aws - 6.5.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-azure - 6.5.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1013-gcp - 6.5.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-lowlatency - 6.5.0-17.17.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-17-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-17.17.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1015-oracle - 6.5.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1010-raspi - 6.5.0-1010.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-starfive - 6.5.0-1007.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1009-laptop - 6.5.0-1009.12\nNo subscription required",
