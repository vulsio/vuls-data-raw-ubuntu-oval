		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: NFS:fs_context: validate UDP retrans to prevent shift out-of-bounds Fix shiftout-of-bounds in xprt_calc_majortimeo(). This is caused by a garbagetimeout (retrans) mount option being passed to nfs mount, in this case fromsyzkaller. If the protocol is XPRT_TRANSPORT_UDP, then 'retrans' is a shiftvalue for a 64-bit long integer, so 'retrans' cannot be >= 64. If it is >=64, fail the mount and return an error.",
