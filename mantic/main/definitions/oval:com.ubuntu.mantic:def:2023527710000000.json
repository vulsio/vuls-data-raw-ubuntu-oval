		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/port: Fix delete_endpoint() vs parent unregistration raceThe CXL subsystem, at cxl_mem ->probe() time, establishes a lineage ofports (struct cxl_port objects) between an endpoint and the root of aCXL topology. Each port including the endpoint port is attached to thecxl_port driver.Given that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineagegoes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through acxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or theentire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.The delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is beingcalled to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called toteardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through->remove().That care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent.Which requires 2 bugs to be fixed:1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free   scenarios like this signature:    BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, kworker/u56:0/11    Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOSedk2-20230524-3.fc38 05/24/2023    Workqueue: cxl_port detach_memdev [cxl_core]    RIP: 0010:spin_bug+0x65/0xa0    Call Trace:      do_raw_spin_lock+0x69/0xa0     __mutex_lock+0x695/0xb80     delete_endpoint+0xad/0x150 [cxl_core]     devres_release_all+0xb8/0x110     device_unbind_cleanup+0xe/0x70     device_release_driver_internal+0x1d2/0x210     detach_memdev+0x15/0x20 [cxl_core]     process_one_work+0x1e3/0x4c0     worker_thread+0x1dd/0x3d02/ In the case of RCH topologies, the parent device that needs to be   locked is not always @port->dev as returned by cxl_mem_find_port(), use   endpoint->dev.parent instead.",
