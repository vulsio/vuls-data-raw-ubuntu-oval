		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_work Whenthe ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crashes withnull pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove functiontries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using cancel_delayed_work_syncroutine and unregister switch from dsa. During dsa_unregister_switch itcalls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn reschedules the workqueue sincemib_interval is non-zero. Due to which queue executed after mib_intervaland it tries to access dp->slave. But the slave is unregistered in theksz_switch_remove function. Hence kernel crashes. To avoid this crash,before canceling the workqueue, resetted the mib_interval to 0. v1 -> v2:-Removed the if condition in ksz_mib_read_work\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47439` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic - 6.2.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic-64k - 6.2.0-20.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-azure - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1003-laptop - 6.5.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi - 6.2.0-1004.5\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi-nolpae - 6.2.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1002-starfive - 6.5.0-1002.3\nNo subscription required",
