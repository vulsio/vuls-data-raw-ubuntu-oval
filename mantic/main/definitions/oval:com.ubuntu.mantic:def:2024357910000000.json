		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: SVM: Flush pages under kvm->lock to fix UAF insvm_register_enc_region()Do the cache flush of converted pages in svm_register_enc_region() beforedropping kvm->lock to fix use-after-free issues where region and/or itsarray of pages could be freed by a different task, e.g. if userspace has__unregister_enc_region_locked() already queued up for the region.Note, the \"obvious\" alternative of using local variables doesn't fullyresolve the bug, as region->pages is also dynamically allocated.  I.e. theregion structure itself would be fine, but region->pages could be freed.Flushing multiple pages under kvm->lock is unfortunate, but the entireflow is a rare slow path, and the manual flush is only needed on CPUs thatlack coherency for encrypted memory.",
