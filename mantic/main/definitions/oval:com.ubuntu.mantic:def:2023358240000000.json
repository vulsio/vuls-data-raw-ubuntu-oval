    "Title": "CVE-2023-35824 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in dm1105_remove in drivers/media/pci/dm1105/dm1105.c. It was discovered that the SDMC DM1105 PCI device driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-35824` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.5.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.5.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
