    "Title": "CVE-2022-41674 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19.16. Attackers able to inject WLAN frames could cause a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c. Sönke Huster discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41674` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.19.0-23.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi - 6.2.0-1004.5\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi-nolpae - 6.2.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.19.0-23.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
