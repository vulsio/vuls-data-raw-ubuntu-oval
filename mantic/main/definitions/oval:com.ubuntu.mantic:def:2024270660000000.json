		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:virtio: packed: fix unmap leak for indirect desc tableWhen use_dma_api and premapped are true, then the do_unmap is false.Because the do_unmap is false, vring_unmap_extra_packed is not called bydetach_buf_packed.  if (unlikely(vq->do_unmap)) {                curr = id;                for (i = 0; i < state->num; i++) {                        vring_unmap_extra_packed(vq,&vq->packed.desc_extra[curr]);                        curr = vq->packed.desc_extra[curr].next;                }  }So the indirect desc table is not unmapped. This causes the unmap leak.So here, we check vq->use_dma_api instead. Synchronously, dma info isupdated based on use_dma_api judgmentThis bug does not occur, because no driver use the premapped withindirect.",
