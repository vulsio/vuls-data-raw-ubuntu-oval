    "Note": "ccdm94> as of 2023-07-18, no fix for this vulnerability was made available by upstream. That is because this is not being considered a wkhtmltopdf issue, but instead an issue with applications using wktohtmlpdf without first sanitizing input that is user-supplied HTML/JS. In the related GitHub issue page it is possible to see that this issue is possibly being disputed. Commit 5426e55 was presented by maintainers as the commit that highlights the fact that they are aware of this behavior, and consider it to be expected."
