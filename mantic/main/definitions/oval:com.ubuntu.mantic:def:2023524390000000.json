But after core-1 device_unregister, put_deviceand before doing kfree, the core-2 may get_device. Then: 1. After core-1kfree idev, the core-2 will do use-after-free for idev. 2. When core-2 douio_release and put_device, the idev will be double freed. To address thisissue, we can get idev atomic & inc idev reference with minor_lock.",
