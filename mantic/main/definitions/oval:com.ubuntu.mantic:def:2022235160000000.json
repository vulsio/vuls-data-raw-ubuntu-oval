		"Title": "CVE-2022-23516 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
		"Description": "Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML documents and fragments, built on top of Nokogiri. Loofah >= 2.2.0, < 2.19.1 uses recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError exception. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue is patched in version 2.19.1. Users who are unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings that are sanitized.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23516` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-loofah - 2.19.1-1\nNo subscription required",
