		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:Fix DMA mappings leak Fix leak, when user changes ring parameters. Duringreallocation of RX buffers, new DMA mappings are created for those buffers.New buffers with different RX ring count should substitute older ones, butthose buffers were freed in ice_vsi_cfg_rxq and reallocated again withice_alloc_rx_buf. kfree on rx_buf caused leak of already mapped DMA.Reallocate ZC with xdp_buf struct, when BPF program loads. Reallocate backto rx_buf, when BPF program unloads. If BPF program is loaded/unloaded andXSK pools are created, reallocate RX queues accordingly inXDP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler. Steps for reproduction: while : do for ((i=0;i<=8160; i=i+32)) do ethtool -G enp130s0f0 rx $i tx $i sleep 0.5 ethtool -genp130s0f0 done done",
