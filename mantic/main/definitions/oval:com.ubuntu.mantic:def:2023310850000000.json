		"Title": "CVE-2023-31085 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/mtd/ubi/cdev.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a divide-by-zero error in do_div(sz,mtd->erasesize), used indirectly by ctrl_cdev_ioctl, when mtd->erasesize is 0. Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31085` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-13.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-laptop - 6.5.0-1006.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 6.5.0-1007.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 6.5.0-13.13\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 6.5.0-13.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-13.13.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 6.5.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1004-starfive - 6.5.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required",
