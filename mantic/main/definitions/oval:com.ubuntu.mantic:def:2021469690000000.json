		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bus: mhi: core: Fix invalid error returning in mhi_queuemhi_queue returns an error when the doorbell is not accessible inthe current state. This can happen when the device is in non M0state, like M3, and needs to be waken-up prior ringing the DB. Thiscase is managed earlier by triggering an asynchronous M3 exit viacontroller resume/suspend callbacks, that in turn will cause M0transition and DB update.So, since it's not an error but just delaying of doorbell update, thereis no reason to return an error.This also fixes a use after free error for skb case, indeed a callerqueuing skb will try to free the skb if the queueing fails, but inthat case queueing has been done.",
