		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vhost-vdpa: fix vm_flags for virtqueue doorbell mapping The virtqueuedoorbell is usually implemented via registeres but we don't provide thenecessary vma->flags like VM_PFNMAP. This may cause several issues e.g whenuserspace tries to map the doorbell via vhost IOTLB, kernel may panic dueto the page is not backed by page structure. This patch fixes this bysetting the necessary vm_flags. With this patch, try to map doorbell viaIOTLB will fail with bad address.",
