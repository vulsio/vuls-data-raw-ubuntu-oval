However thefunction uses per-task counters to track the number of inflight requests,so it counts more requests than available via currect io_uring ctx and goesto sleep for them to appear (e.g. from IRQ), that will never happen. Cancela bit more than before, i.e. all ctxs that share sqpoll and continue to useshared counters. Don't forget that we should not remove ctx from the listbefore running that task_work sqpoll-cancel, otherwise the functionwouldn't be able to find the context and will hang.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46942` to fix the vulnerability.
