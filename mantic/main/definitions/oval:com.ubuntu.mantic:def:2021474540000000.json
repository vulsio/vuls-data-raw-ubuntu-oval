		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline WithPREEMPT_COUNT=y, when a CPU is offlined and then onlined again, we get:BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0/0x00000000 no locks held byswapper/1/0. CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #100Call Trace: dump_stack_lvl+0xac/0x108 __schedule_bug+0xac/0xe0__schedule+0xcf8/0x10d0 schedule_idle+0x3c/0x70 do_idle+0x2d8/0x4a0cpu_startup_entry+0x38/0x40 start_secondary+0x2ec/0x3a0start_secondary_prolog+0x10/0x14 This is because powerpc'sarch_cpu_idle_dead() decrements the idle task's preempt count, for reasonsexplained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 (\"powerpc: Re-enable preemption beforecpu_die()\"), specifically \"start_secondary() expects a preempt_count() of0.\" However, since commit 2c669ef6979c (\"powerpc/preempt: Don't touch theidle task's preempt_count during hotplug\") and commit f1a0a376ca0c(\"sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled\"), thatjustification no longer holds. The idle task isn't supposed to re-enablepreemption, so remove the vestigial preempt_enable() from the CPU offlinepath. Tested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47454` to fix the vulnerability.
