		"Title": "CVE-2022-2585 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
		"Description": "It was discovered that when exec'ing from a non-leader thread, armed POSIX CPU timers would be left on a list but freed, leading to a use-after-free. It was discovered that the implementation of POSIX timers in the Linux kernel did not properly clean up timers in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2585` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 5.19.0-21.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 5.19.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1007-raspi - 5.19.0-1004.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic - 5.19.0-21.21\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-generic-64k - 5.19.0-21.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-aws - 5.19.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency - 5.19.0-1007.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-13-lowlatency-64k - 5.19.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1012-oracle - 5.19.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required",
