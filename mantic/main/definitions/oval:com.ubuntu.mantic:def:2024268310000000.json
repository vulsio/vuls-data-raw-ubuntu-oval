		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but    handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000    req == 0000000060f99b40not ok 11 req_destroy worksThis is because \"sock_release(sock)\" was replaced with \"fput(filp)\"to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronousbut fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changedbut handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroymethod. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that thefinal close is complete before it checks the pointer.We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is nevercalled (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.Reported by: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>",
