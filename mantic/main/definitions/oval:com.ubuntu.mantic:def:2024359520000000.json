		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/ast: Fix soft lockupThere is a while-loop in ast_dp_set_on_off() that could lead toinfinite-loop. This is because the register, VGACRI-Dx, checked inthis API is a scratch register actually controlled by a MCU, namedDPMCU, in BMC.These scratch registers are protected by scu-lock. If suc-lock is notoff, DPMCU can not update these registers and then host will have softlockup due to never updated status.DPMCU is used to control DP and relative registers to handshake withhost's VGA driver. Even the most time-consuming task, DP's linktraining, is less than 100ms. 200ms should be enough.",
