		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: udp:skip L4 aggregation for UDP tunnel packets If NETIF_F_GRO_FRAGLIST orNETIF_F_GRO_UDP_FWD are enabled, and there are UDP tunnels available in thesystem, udp_gro_receive() could end-up doing L4 aggregation (eitherSKB_GSO_UDP_L4 or SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST) at the outer UDP tunnel level forpackets effectively carrying and UDP tunnel header. That could cause innerprotocol corruption. If e.g. the relevant packets carry a vxlan header,different vxlan ids will be ignored/ aggregated to the same GSO packet.Inner headers will be ignored, too, so that e.g. TCP over vxlan pushpackets will be held in the GRO engine till the next flush, etc. Just skipthe SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 and SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST code path if the current packetcould land in a UDP tunnel, and let udp_gro_receive() do GRO viaudp_sk(sk)->gro_receive. The check implemented in this patch is broaderthan what is strictly needed, as the existing UDP tunnel could be e.g.configured on top of a different device: we could end-up skipping GROat-all for some packets. Anyhow, that is a very thin corner case andcovering it will add quite a bit of complexity. v1 -> v2: - hopefullyclarify the commit message\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47036` to fix the vulnerability.
