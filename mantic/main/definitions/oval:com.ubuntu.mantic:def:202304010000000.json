		"title": "CVE-2023-0401 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified onPKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm usedfor the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation ofthe hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail.There is a missing check for the return value from the initializationfunction which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likelyleading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused byusing FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by notloading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME librarycalls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementationin OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applicationswould be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures onuntrusted data.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0401` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.8-1ubuntu1\nopenssl - 3.0.8-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
