The error handing will call cpuhp_state_remove_instance()to call uncore pmu offline callback, which migrate the pmu context.Since that's liable to lead to some kind of use-after-free.Use cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() instead ofcpuhp_state_remove_instance() so that the notifiers don't execute afterthe PMU device has been failed to register.",
