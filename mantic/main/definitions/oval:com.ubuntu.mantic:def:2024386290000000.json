		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_idafile_ida is allocated during cdev open and is freed accordinglyduring cdev release. This sequence is guaranteed by driver fileoperations. Therefore, there is no need to destroy an already emptyfile_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.Worse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction offile_ida per WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_idaafter it has been destroyed, resulting in a kernel panic.Remove ida_destroy(&file_ida) to address these issues.",
