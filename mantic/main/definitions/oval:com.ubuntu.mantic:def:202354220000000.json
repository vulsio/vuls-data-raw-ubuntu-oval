		"description": "The functions to fetch e-mail via POP3 or IMAP as well as sending e-mailvia SMTP use OpenSSL for static SSL or TLS based communication. As theSSL_get_verify_result() function is not used the certificated is trustedalways and it can not be ensured that the certificate satisfies allnecessary security requirements. This could allow an attacker to use aninvalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expiredcertificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if thecertificate is properly validated. This issue affects OTRS: from 7.0.Xbefore 7.0.47, from 8.0.X before 8.0.37; ((OTRS)) Community Edition: from6.0.X through 6.0.34.",
