		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handling Syzbot reports that when youhave AP_VLAN interfaces that are up and close the AP interface they belongto, we get a deadlock. No surprise - since we dev_close() them with thewiphy mutex held, which goes back into the netdev notifier in cfg80211 andtries to acquire the wiphy mutex there. To fix this, we need to do twothings: 1) prevent changing iftype while AP_VLANs are up, we can't easilyfix this case since cfg80211 already calls us with the wiphy mutex held,but change_interface() is relatively rare in drivers anyway, so changingiftype isn't used much (and userspace has to fall back to down/change/upanyway) 2) pull the dev_close() loop over VLANs out of the wiphy mutexsection in the normal stop case",
