		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failureOn TDX it is possible for the untrusted host to causeset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that anerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need totake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or securityissues.DMA could free decrypted/shared pages if dma_set_decrypted() fails. Thisshould be a rare case. Just leak the pages in this case instead offreeing them.",
