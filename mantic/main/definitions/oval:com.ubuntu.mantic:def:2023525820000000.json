		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfs:Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio If a networkfilesystem using netfs implements a clamp_length() function, it can setsubrequest lengths smaller than a page size. When we loop through thefolios in netfs_rreq_unlock_folios() to set any folios to be written back,we need to make sure we only call folio_start_fscache() once for eachfolio. Otherwise, this simple testcase: mount -o fsc,rsize=1024,wsize=1024127.0.0.1:/export /mnt/nfs dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/file.bin bs=4096count=1 1+0 records in 1+0 records out 4096 bytes (4.1 kB, 4.0 KiB) copied,0.0126359 s, 324 kB/s echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches cat/mnt/nfs/file.bin > /dev/null will trigger an oops similar to thefollowing: page dumped because:VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO(folio_test_private_2(folio)) ------------[ cut here]------------ kernel BUG at include/linux/netfs.h:44! ...
