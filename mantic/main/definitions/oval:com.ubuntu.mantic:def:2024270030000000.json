		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summarySimilar to the previous commit, we should make sure that all devices areruntime resumed before printing the clk_summary through debugfs. Failureto do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a deviceto print clk state and that device is also runtime resuming in anotherthread, e.g the screen is turning on and the display driver is startingup. We remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{get,put}() in this pathbecause they're superfluous now that we know the devices are runtimeresumed. This also squashes a bug where the return value ofclk_pm_runtime_get() wasn't checked, leading to an RPM count underflowon error paths.",
