		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: libbpf:Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query() When the feature_flags andxdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf bpf_xdp_query_opts, thecode writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro. This causes libbpf towrite to those fields unconditionally, which means that programs compiledagainst an older version of libbpf (with a smaller size of thebpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by libbpf writingout of bounds. The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bailout if the feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via theOPTS_HAS) macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. Forconsistency, this fix just changes the assignments to both fields to usethe OPTS_SET() macro.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27050` to fix the vulnerability.
