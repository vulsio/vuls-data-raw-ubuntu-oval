		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpfbpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro.This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which meansthat programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smallersize of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted bylibbpf writing out of bounds.The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if thefeature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS)macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, thisfix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()macro.",
