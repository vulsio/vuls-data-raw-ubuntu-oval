		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86,relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes section When building withCONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into the .notes section so thatXen can find the \"startup_xen\" entry point. This information is used priorto booting the kernel, so relocations are not useful. In fact, performingrelocations against the .notes section means that the KASLR base is exposedsince /sys/kernel/notes is world-readable. To avoid leaking the KASLR basewithout breaking unprivileged tools that are expecting to read/sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations in the .notes section. Thevalues readable in .notes are then identical to those found in System.map.",
