		"Description": "The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length whichmay lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reservedskippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead toexcessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered bysupplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via anetwork stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.",
