		"title": "CVE-2024-35960 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Properly link new fs rules into the treePreviously, add_rule_fg would only add newly created rules from thehandle into the tree when they had a refcount of 1. On the other hand,create_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existingidentical rules instead of creating new ones.These two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle1) creates a new rule and references it, then2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it   again,resulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into thetree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash whenthe flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on ruledeletion, assumes node->parent is != NULL.This happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrecthandling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code increate_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the sameflow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Full details areat [1].This patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules without parents intothe tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash. This makesit more consistent with how rules are added to an FTE increate_flow_handle.",
