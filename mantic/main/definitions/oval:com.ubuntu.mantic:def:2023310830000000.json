		"Title": "CVE-2023-31083 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. In hci_uart_tty_ioctl, there is a race condition between HCIUARTSETPROTO and HCIUARTGETPROTO. HCI_UART_PROTO_SET is set before hu->proto is set. A NULL pointer dereference may occur. Yu Hao and Weiteng Chen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI UART driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
