		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requestsSince we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on ourrequests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, whenthe cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with anartificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueuedto the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callbackwill also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which itseems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the newtls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY toEINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handlingpaths. The handling is identical.",
