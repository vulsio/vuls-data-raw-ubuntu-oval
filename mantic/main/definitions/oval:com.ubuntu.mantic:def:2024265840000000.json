		"title": "CVE-2024-26584 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests Since we're setting theCRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS invalid situations. For example, when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full(easy to trigger with an artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen),requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,the async callback will also be called twice: first with err ==-EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the newtls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS toavoid having to modify all the error handling paths. The handling isidentical.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26584` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic-64k - 6.5.0-41.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1021-aws - 6.5.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-azure - 6.5.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-gcp - 6.5.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1017-laptop - 6.5.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-oracle - 6.5.0-1024.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-oracle-64k - 6.5.0-1024.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1018-raspi - 6.5.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1015-starfive - 6.5.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required",
