		"title": "CVE-2024-26678 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section The.compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of the32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from 32-bitfirmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y) This section is only 8 bytes in sizeand is only referenced from the loader, and so it is placed at the end ofthe memory view of the image, to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, whichis required for sections appearing in the middle of the image.Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and even if most EFI loaderswill work correctly (including the Tianocore reference implementation), PEloaders do exist that reject such images, on the basis that both the fileand memory views of the file contents should be described by the sectionheaders in a monotonically increasing manner without leaving any gaps. Soreorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slightpadding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disablingCONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26678` to fix the vulnerability.
