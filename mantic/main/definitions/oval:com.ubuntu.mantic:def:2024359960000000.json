		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: cpu:Re-enable CPU mitigations by default for !X86 architectures Rename x86's toCPU_MITIGATIONS, define it in generic code, and force it on for allarchitectures exception x86. A recent commit to turn mitigations off bydefault if SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS=n kinda sorta missed that\"cpu_mitigations\" is completely generic, whereas SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS isx86-specific. Rename x86's SPECULATIVE_MITIGATIONS instead of keeping bothand have it select CPU_MITIGATIONS, as having two configs for the samething is unnecessary and confusing. This will also allow x86 to use theknob to manage mitigations that aren't strictly related to speculativeexecution. Use another Kconfig to communicate to common code thatCPU_MITIGATIONS is already defined instead of having x86's menu depend onthe common CPU_MITIGATIONS. This allows keeping a single point of contactfor all of x86's mitigations, and it's not clear that other architectures*want* to allow disabling mitigations at compile-time.",
