    "Title": "CVE-2023-2235 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel Performance Events system can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The perf_group_detach function did not check the event's siblings' attach_state before calling add_event_to_groups(), but remove_on_exec made it possible to call list_del_event() on before detaching from their group, making it possible to use a dangling pointer causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit fd0815f632c24878e325821943edccc7fde947a2. It was discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2235` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-6.3.0-7-generic-lpae - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic - 6.3.0-7.7\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-generic-64k - 6.3.0-7.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.3.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.3.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required",
