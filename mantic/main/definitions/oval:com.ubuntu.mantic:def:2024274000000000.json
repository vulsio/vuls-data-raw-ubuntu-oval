		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: once more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2 Thisreverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event amdgpu_bo_move always move on sameheap. The basic problem here is that after the move the old location issimply not available any more. Some fixes were suggested, but essentiallywe should call the move notification before actually moving things becauseonly this way we have the correct order for DMA-buf and VM movenotifications as well. Also rework the statistic handling so that we don'tupdate the eviction counter before the move. v2: add missing NULL check",
