    "Title": "CVE-2020-24240 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
    "Description": "GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-24240` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbison - 2:3.8.2+dfsg-1build1\nNo subscription required",
