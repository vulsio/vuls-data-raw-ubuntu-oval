		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2.Since the page allocator does not yield CPU resources to the owner of theoom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user can trivially lock up the systemforever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator (e.g., viaconcurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE:the software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in partbecause of a viewpoint that \"the underlying problem is non-trivial tohandle.\"\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-10723` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-6.2.0-20-generic-lpae - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-20-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-raspi-nolpae - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required",
