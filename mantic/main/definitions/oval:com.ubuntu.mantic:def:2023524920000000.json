		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function__dma_async_device_channel_register() can fail. In case of failure,chan->local is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan->local is nullified.When dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of managed API orintentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are unconditionallyunregistered, leading to this NULL pointer: [ 1.318693] Unable to handlekernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000d0 [...] [1.484499] Call trace: [ 1.486930] device_del+0x40/0x394 [ 1.490314]device_unregister+0x20/0x7c [ 1.494220]__dma_async_device_channel_unregister+0x68/0xc0 Look atdma_async_device_register() function error path, channel deviceunregistration is done only if chan->local is not NULL. Then add the samecondition at the beginning of __dma_async_device_channel_unregister()function, to avoid NULL pointer issue whatever the API used to reach thisfunction.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52492` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic-64k - 6.5.0-41.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-azure - 6.5.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-gcp - 6.5.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1017-laptop - 6.5.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1018-raspi - 6.5.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1015-starfive - 6.5.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required",
