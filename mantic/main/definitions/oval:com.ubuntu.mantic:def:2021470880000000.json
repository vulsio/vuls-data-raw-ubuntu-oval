		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/damon/dbgfs: protect targets destructions with kdamond_lockDAMON debugfs interface iterates current monitoring targets in'dbgfs_target_ids_read()' while holding the corresponding'kdamond_lock'.  However, it also destructs the monitoring targets in'dbgfs_before_terminate()' without holding the lock.  This can result ina use_after_free bug.  This commit avoids the race by protecting thedestruction with the corresponding 'kdamond_lock'.",
