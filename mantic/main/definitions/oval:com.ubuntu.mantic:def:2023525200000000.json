Move the setting name validation into a separatefunction to allow for this change without having to duplicate thecleanup code for this setting.As a side note, a very similar bug was fixed incommit 7295a996fdab (\"platform/x86: dell-sysman: Fix reference leak\"),so it seems that the bug was copied from that driver.Compile-tested only.",
