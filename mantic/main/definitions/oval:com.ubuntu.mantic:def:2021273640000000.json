    "Title": "CVE-2021-27364 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c is adversely affected by the ability of an unprivileged user to craft Netlink messages. Adam Nichols discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the iSCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-27364` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required",

However, 688e8128b7a92d commit requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for netlink access also mitigates the vulnerability."
