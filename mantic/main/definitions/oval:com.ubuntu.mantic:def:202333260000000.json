		"description": "pam_krb5 authenticates a user by essentially running kinit with thepassword, getting a ticket-granting ticket (tgt) from the Kerberos KDC (KeyDistribution Center) over the network, as a way to verify the password.However, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam_krb5 has no wayto validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the tgtprovided over the network as being valid. In a non-default FreeBSDinstallation that leverages pam_krb5 for authentication and does not have akeytab provisioned, an attacker that is able to control both the passwordand the KDC responses can return a valid tgt, allowing authentication tooccur for any user on the system.",
