		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: Init zone device and drm client after mode-1 reset on reload Inpassthrough environment, when amdgpu is reloaded after unload, mode-1 istriggered after initializing the necessary IPs, That init does not includeKFD, and KFD init waits until the reset is completed. KFD init is called inthe reset handler, but in this case, the zone device and drm client is notinitialized, causing app to create kernel panic. v2: Removing the init KFDcondition from amdgpu_amdkfd_drm_client_create. As the previous version hasthe potential of creating DRM client twice. v3: v2 patch results in SDMAengine hung as DRM open causes VM clear to SDMA before SDMA init. Addingthe condition to in drm client creation, on top of v1, to guard against drmclient creation call multiple times.",
