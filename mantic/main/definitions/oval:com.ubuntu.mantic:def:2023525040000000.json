		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives() Fei has reportedthat KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on a 5-level pagingmachine: BUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching() Read of size 4 ataddr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0 ... __asan_load4()rcu_is_watching() trace_hardirqs_on() text_poke_early()apply_alternatives() ... On machines with 5-level paging,cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57) gets patched. It includes KASAN code,where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is definedwith cpu_feature_enabled(). KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives()patches the KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makesKASAN_SHADOW_START static, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, worksaround the issue. Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel ispatching alternatives. [ mingo: updated the changelog ]",
