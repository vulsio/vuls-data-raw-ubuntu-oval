		"Title": "CVE-2023-22496 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"Description": "Netdata is an open source option for real-time infrastructure monitoringand troubleshooting. An attacker with the ability to establish a streamingconnection can execute arbitrary commands on the targeted Netdata agent.When an alert is triggered, the function `health_alarm_execute` is called.This function performs different checks and then enqueues a command bycalling `spawn_enq_cmd`. This command is populated with several argumentsthat are not sanitized. One of them is the `registry_hostname` of the nodefor which the alert is raised. By providing a specially crafted`registry_hostname` as part of the health data that is streamed to aNetdata (parent) agent, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands at theremote host as a side-effect of the raised alert. Note that the commandsare executed as the user running the Netdata Agent. This user is usuallynamed `netdata`. The ability to run arbitrary commands may allow anattacker to escalate privileges by escalating other vulnerabilities in thesystem, as that user. The problem has been fixed in: Netdata agent v1.37(stable) and Netdata agent v1.36.0-409 (nightly). As a workaround,streaming is not enabled by default. If you have previously enabled this,it can be disabled. Limiting access to the port on the recipient Agent totrusted child connections may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.",
