		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ handling due to shared interruptsThe driver requests the interrupts as IRQF_SHARED, so the interrupthandlers can be called at any time. If such a call happens while the ISPis powered down, the SoC will hang as the driver tries to access theISP registers.This can be reproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line:Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ and unload the driver, and the board willhang.Fix this by adding a new field, 'irqs_enabled', which is used to bailout from the interrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.",
