		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Defer the free of inner map when necessary When updating or deleting aninner map in map array or map htab, the map may still be accessed bynon-sleepable program or sleepable program. However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr()decreases the ref-counter of the inner map directly through bpf_map_put(),if the ref-counter is the last one (which is true for most cases), theinner map will be freed by ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most.map_free() callbacks don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to waitfor the elapse of a RCU grace period, so after the invocation ofops->map_free completes, the bpf program which is accessing the inner mapmay incur use-after-free problem. Fix the free of inner map by invokingbpf_map_free_deferred() after both one RCU grace period and one tasks traceRCU grace period if the inner map has been removed from the outer mapbefore. The deferment is accomplished by using call_rcu() orcall_rcu_tasks_trace() when releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. Thenewly-added rcu_head field in bpf_map shares the same storage space withwork field to reduce the size of bpf_map.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52447` to fix the vulnerability.
