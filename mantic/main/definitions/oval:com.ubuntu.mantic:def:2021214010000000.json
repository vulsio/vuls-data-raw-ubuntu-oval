		"description": "Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in ansi C. InNanopb before versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5, decoding a specifically formedmessage can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message typecontains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointerfield and a non-pointer field. If the message data first contains thenon-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the non-pointerfield is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such messagedata rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusteddata is parsed. This has been fixed in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5. Seereferenced GitHub Security Advisory for more information includingworkarounds.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21401` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnanopb - 0.4.6-1\nNo subscription required",
