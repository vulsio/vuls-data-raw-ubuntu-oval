		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched: Fix out-of-bound access in uclampUtil-clamp places tasks in different buckets based on their clamp valuesfor performance reasons. However, the size of buckets is currentlycomputed using a rounding division, which can lead to an off-by-oneerror in some configurations.For instance, with 20 buckets, the bucket size will be 1024/20=51. Atask with a clamp of 1024 will be mapped to bucket id 1024/51=20. Sadly,correct indexes are in range [0,19], hence leading to an out of boundmemory access.Clamp the bucket id to fix the issue.",
