		"title": "CVE-2023-52456 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: serial:imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock When using the serial port as RS485 port,the tx statemachine is used to control the RTS pin to drive the RS485transceiver TX_EN pin. When the TTY port is closed in the middle of atransmission (for instance during userland application crash),imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface and disables the TransmissionComplete interrupt. afer that, imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incompletetransmission, to be retriggered by the TC interrupt. This interrupt isdisabled and therefore the tx statemachine never transitions out of SEND.The statemachine is in deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making theinterface useless. imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmissionAND whether TC interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered.This makes sure the state machine handling is reached, and is properly setto WAIT_AFTER_SEND.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52456` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic - 6.5.0-41.41\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-generic-64k - 6.5.0-41.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1021-aws - 6.5.0-1021.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-azure - 6.5.0-1022.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1022-gcp - 6.5.0-1022.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1017-laptop - 6.5.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-41-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-41.41.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-oracle - 6.5.0-1024.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1024-oracle-64k - 6.5.0-1024.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1018-raspi - 6.5.0-1018.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1015-starfive - 6.5.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required",
