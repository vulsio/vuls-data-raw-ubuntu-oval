		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPICThe below warning is splatting during guest reboot.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1931 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10322kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]  CPU: 0 PID: 1931 Comm: qemu-system-x86 Tainted: G          I5.17.0-rc1+ #5  RIP: 0010:kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]  Call Trace:   <TASK>   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x279/0x710 [kvm]   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x83/0xb0   do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xc0   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae  RIP: 0033:0x7fd39797350bThis can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline mode and doing a rebootinthe guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot pathwill not disarm the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown()clearsAPIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bit is 0, this can triggertimer-modeswitch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic, which can result inpreemptiontimer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on thiswhennot exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated bypreemptiontimer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemptiontimerunder KVM_SET_LAPIC.",
