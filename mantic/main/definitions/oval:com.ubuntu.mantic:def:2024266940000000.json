Therefore, the freeing must also bedone differently, explicitly NULL'ing it out after the free, sinceotherwise there's a nasty double-free bug here if a file fails to loadafter this has been parsed, and we get another free later (e.g. because noother file exists.) Fix that by adding the missing NULL assignment.",
