		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/mlx5: Fix releasing unallocated memory in dereg MR flowFor the case of IB_MR_TYPE_DM the mr does doesn't have a umem, even thoughit is a user MR. This causes function mlx5_free_priv_descs() to think thatit is a kernel MR, leading to wrongly accessing mr->descs that will getwrong values in the union which leads to attempt to release resources thatwere not allocated in the first place.For example: DMA-API: mlx5_core 0000:08:00.1: device driver tries to free DMA memory ithas not allocated [device address=0x0000000000000000] [size=0 bytes] WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 1021 at kernel/dma/debug.c:961check_unmap+0x54f/0x8b0 RIP: 0010:check_unmap+0x54f/0x8b0 Call Trace:  debug_dma_unmap_page+0x57/0x60  mlx5_free_priv_descs+0x57/0x70 [mlx5_ib]  mlx5_ib_dereg_mr+0x1fb/0x3d0 [mlx5_ib]  ib_dereg_mr_user+0x60/0x140 [ib_core]  uverbs_destroy_uobject+0x59/0x210 [ib_uverbs]  uobj_destroy+0x3f/0x80 [ib_uverbs]  ib_uverbs_cmd_verbs+0x435/0xd10 [ib_uverbs]  ? uverbs_finalize_object+0x50/0x50 [ib_uverbs]  ? lock_acquire+0xc4/0x2e0  ? lock_acquired+0x12/0x380  ? lock_acquire+0xc4/0x2e0  ? lock_acquire+0xc4/0x2e0  ? ib_uverbs_ioctl+0x7c/0x140 [ib_uverbs]  ? lock_release+0x28a/0x400  ib_uverbs_ioctl+0xc0/0x140 [ib_uverbs]  ? ib_uverbs_ioctl+0x7c/0x140 [ib_uverbs]  __x64_sys_ioctl+0x7f/0xb0  do_syscall_64+0x38/0x90Fix it by reorganizing the dereg flow and mlx5_ib_mr structure: - Move the ib_umem field into the user MRs structure in the union as it's   applicable only there. - Function mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() will now call mlx5_free_priv_descs() only   in case there isn't udata, which indicates that this isn't a user MR.",
