		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mptcp:fix data stream corruption Maxim reported several issues when forcing a TCPtransparent proxy to use the MPTCP protocol for the inbound connections. Healso provided a clean reproducer. The problem boils down to'mptcp_frag_can_collapse_to()' assuming that only MPTCP will use the givenpage_frag. If others - e.g. the plain TCP protocol - allocate pagefragments, we can end-up re-using already allocated memory formptcp_data_frag. Fix the issue ensuring that the to-be-expanded datafragment is located at the current page frag end. v1 -> v2: - added missingfixes tag (Mat)",
