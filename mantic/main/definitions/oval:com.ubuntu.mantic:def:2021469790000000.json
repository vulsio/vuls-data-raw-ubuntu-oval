For the first time duringiio_device_unregister() then later on insideiio_device_unregister_eventset() and iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask().Double free leads to kernel panic.Fix this by not touching ioctl handlers list directly but ratherletting code responsible for registration call the matching cleanuproutine itself.",
