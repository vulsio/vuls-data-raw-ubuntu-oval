		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix masking negation logic upon negative dst registerThe negation logic for the case where the off_reg is sitting in thedst register is not correct given then we cannot just invert the addto a sub or vice versa. As a fix, perform the final bitwise and-opunconditionally into AX from the off_reg, then move the pointer fromthe src to dst and finally use AX as the source for the originalpointer arithmetic operation such that the inversion yields a correctresult. The single non-AX mov in between is possible given constantblinding is retaining it as it's not an immediate based operation.",
