		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:vlan: fix underflow for the real_dev refcnt Inject error beforedev_hold(real_dev) in register_vlan_dev(), and execute the followingtestcase: ip link add dev dummy1 type dummy ip link add name dummy1.100link dummy1 type vlan id 100 ip link del dev dummy1 When the dummynetdevice is removed, we will get a WARNING as following:=======================================================================refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory. WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 atlib/refcount.c:31 refcount_warn_saturate+0xbf/0x1e0 and an endless loop of:=======================================================================unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count =-1073741824 That is because dev_put(real_dev) in vlan_dev_free() be calledwithout dev_hold(real_dev) in register_vlan_dev(). It makes the refcnt ofreal_dev underflow. Move the dev_hold(real_dev) to vlan_dev_init() which isthe call-back of ndo_init(). That makes dev_hold() and dev_put() for vlan'sreal_dev symmetrical.",
