		"Title": "CVE-2023-4207 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. When fw_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit 76e42ae831991c828cffa8c37736ebfb831ad5ec.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4207` to fix the vulnerability.
