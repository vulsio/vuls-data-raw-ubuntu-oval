		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/drm_file: Fix pid refcounting racefilp->pid is supposed to be a refcounted pointer; however, before thispatch, drm_file_update_pid() only increments the refcount of a structpid after storing a pointer to it in filp->pid and dropping thedev->filelist_mutex, making the following race possible:process A               process B=========               =========                        begin drm_file_update_pid                        mutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex)                        rcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, <pid B>, 1)                        mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex)begin drm_file_update_pidmutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex)rcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, <pid A>, 1)mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex)get_pid(<pid A>)synchronize_rcu()put_pid(<pid B>)   *** pid B reaches refcount 0 and is freed here ***                        get_pid(<pid B>)   *** UAF ***                        synchronize_rcu()                        put_pid(<pid A>)As far as I know, this race can only occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=ybecause it requires RCU to detect a quiescent state in code that is notexplicitly calling into the scheduler.This race leads to use-after-free of a \"struct pid\".It is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to passthrough a synchronize_rcu() operation while process B is betweenmutex_unlock() and get_pid().Fix it by ensuring that by the time a pointer to the current task's pidis stored in the file, an extra reference to the pid has been taken.This fix also removes the condition for synchronize_rcu(); I thinkthat optimization is unnecessary complexity, since in that case wewould usually have bailed out on the lockless check above.",
