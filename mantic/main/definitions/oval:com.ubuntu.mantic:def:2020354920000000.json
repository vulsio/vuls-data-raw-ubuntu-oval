    "Description": "A flaw was found in cairo's image-compositor.c in all versions prior to 1.17.4. This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairo's image-compositor (for example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -> out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-35492` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibcairo-gobject2 - 1.16.0-5ubuntu2\nlibcairo-script-interpreter2 - 1.16.0-5ubuntu2\nlibcairo2 - 1.16.0-5ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
