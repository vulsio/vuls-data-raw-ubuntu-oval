    "Title": "CVE-2023-1859 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in xen_9pfs_front_removet in net/9p/trans_xen.c in Xen transport for 9pfs in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem, possibly leading to a kernel information leak. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer implementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).",
