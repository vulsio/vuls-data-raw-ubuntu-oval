    "Title": "CVE-2022-4382 on Ubuntu 23.10 (mantic) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw caused by a race among the superblock operations in the gadgetfs Linux driver was found. It could be triggered by yanking out a device that is running the gadgetfs side. Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4382` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 6.2.0-18.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1006-raspi - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-generic-64k - 6.2.0-18.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-10-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1011-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
