		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/damon/dbgfs: fix 'struct pid' leaks in 'dbgfs_target_ids_write()'DAMON debugfs interface increases the reference counts of 'struct pid'sfor targets from the 'target_ids' file write callback('dbgfs_target_ids_write()'), but decreases the counts only in DAMONmonitoring termination callback ('dbgfs_before_terminate()').Therefore, when 'target_ids' file is repeatedly written without DAMONmonitoring start/termination, the reference count is not decreased andtherefore memory for the 'struct pid' cannot be freed.  This commitfixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids' iswritten.",
