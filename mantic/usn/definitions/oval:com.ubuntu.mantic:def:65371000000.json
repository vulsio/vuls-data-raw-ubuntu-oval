		"description": "Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-31085)  Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39189)  Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4244)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in certain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42754)  Yikebaer Aizezi discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when handling inode extent metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-45898)  Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash). (CVE-2023-5090)  Jason Wang discovered that the virtio ring implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle iov buffers in some situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2023-5158)  Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5178)  It was discovered that the SMB network file sharing protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5345)  Murray McAllister discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle memory objects when storing surfaces, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5633)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5717)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6537-1` to fix the vulnerability.
