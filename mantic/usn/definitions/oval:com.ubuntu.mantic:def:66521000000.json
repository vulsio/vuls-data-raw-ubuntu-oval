		"description": "Marek Marczykowski-GÃ³recki discovered that the Xen event channel infrastructure implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (paravirtualized device unavailability). (CVE-2023-34324)  Zheng Wang discovered a use-after-free in the Renesas Ethernet AVB driver in the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-35827)  Tom Dohrmann discovered that the Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel contained a race condition when accessing MMIO registers. A local attacker in a SEV guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-46813)  It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-46862)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51780)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inner tunnel netlink attributes, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-5972)  It was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform cryptographic operations in some situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6176)  Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when handling io_uring over sockets, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6531)  Xingyuan Mo discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle dynset expressions passed from userspace, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6622)  Zhenghan Wang discovered that the generic ID allocator implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for null bitmap when releasing IDs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6915)  Robert Morris discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain server commands fields, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-0565)  Jann Horn discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle the release of certain buffer rings. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0582)  It was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking during tipc_crypto_key_revoke() operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2024-0641)  Jann Horn discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle spliced messages, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0646)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6652-1` to fix the vulnerability.
