		"description": "Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in IP set operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42756)  Alex Birnberg discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate register length, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4881)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packets in certain conditions, leading to a use after free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4921)  Kevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle removal of rules from chain bindings in certain circumstances, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5197)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6454-4` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-buildinfo-6.5.0-1003-starfive - 6.5.0-1003.4 linux-headers-6.5.0-1003-starfive - 6.5.0-1003.4 linux-modules-6.5.0-1003-starfive - 6.5.0-1003.4 linux-starfive-tools-6.5.0-1003 - 6.5.0-1003.4 linux-modules-extra-6.5.0-1003-starfive - 6.5.0-1003.4 linux-image-6.5.0-1003-starfive - 6.5.0-1003.4 linux-tools-6.5.0-1003-starfive - 6.5.0-1003.4 linux-starfive-headers-6.5.0-1003 - 6.5.0-1003.4 No subscription required  linux-image-starfive - 6.5.0.1003.5 linux-starfive - 6.5.0.1003.5 linux-headers-starfive - 6.5.0.1003.5 linux-tools-starfive - 6.5.0.1003.5 No subscription required",
