		"description": "It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled padding when checking PKCS#1 certificates. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform Bleichenbacher-like attacks and recover private data. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-4421)  It was discovered that NSS had a timing side-channel when performing RSA decryption. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover private data. (CVE-2023-5388)  It was discovered that NSS had a timing side-channel when using certain NIST curves. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover private data. (CVE-2023-6135)  The NSS package contained outdated CA certificates. This update refreshes the NSS package to version 3.98 which includes the latest CA certificate bundle and other security improvements.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6727-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libnss3 - 2:3.98-0ubuntu0.23.10.1 libnss3-dev - 2:3.98-0ubuntu0.23.10.1 libnss3-tools - 2:3.98-0ubuntu0.23.10.1 No subscription required",
