		"description": "Takeshi Kaneko discovered that Go did not properly handle comments and special tags in the script context of html/template module. An attacker could possibly use this issue to inject Javascript code and perform a cross site scripting attack. This issue only affected Go 1.20 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-39318, CVE-2023-39319)  It was discovered that Go did not properly validate the \"//go:cgo_\" directives during compilation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to inject arbitrary code during compile time. (CVE-2023-39323)  It was discovered that Go did not limit the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines in the net/http module. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2023-39325, CVE-2023-44487)  It was discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly validate the chunk extensions reading from a request or response body. An attacker could possibly use this issue to read sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39326)  It was discovered that Go did not properly validate the insecure \"git://\" protocol when using go get to fetch a module with the \".git\" suffix. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass secure protocol checks. (CVE-2023-45285)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6574-1` to fix the vulnerability.
