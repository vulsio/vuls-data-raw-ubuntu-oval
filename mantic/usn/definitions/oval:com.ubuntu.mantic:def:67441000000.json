		"description": "Hugo van Kemenade discovered that Pillow was not properly performing  bounds checks when processing an ICC file, which could lead to a buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a  specially crafted ICC file, an attacker could possibly use this issue  to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6744-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-pil-doc - 10.0.0-1ubuntu0.2 python3-pil - 10.0.0-1ubuntu0.2 python3-pil.imagetk - 10.0.0-1ubuntu0.2 No subscription required",
