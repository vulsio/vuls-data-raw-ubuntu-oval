		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:video/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()In aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(), we currently onlycall sysfb_disable() on vga class devices.  This leads to thefollowing problem when the pimary device is not VGA compatible:1. A PCI device with a non-VGA class is the boot display2. That device is probed first and it is not a VGA device so   sysfb_disable() is not called, but the device resources   are freed by aperture_detach_platform_device()3. Non-primary GPU has a VGA class and it ends up calling sysfb_disable()4. NULL pointer dereference via sysfb_disable() since the resources   have already been freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() when   it was called by the other device.Fix this by passing a device pointer to sysfb_disable() and checkingthe device to determine if we should execute it or not.v2: Fix build when CONFIG_SCREEN_INFO is not setv3: Move device check into the mutex    Drop primary variable in aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()    Drop __init on pci sysfb_pci_dev_is_enabled()\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46698` to fix the vulnerability.
