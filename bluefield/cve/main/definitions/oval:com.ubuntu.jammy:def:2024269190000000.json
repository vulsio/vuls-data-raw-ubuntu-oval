		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:ulpi: Fix debugfs directory leak The ULPI per-device debugfs root is namedafter the ulpi device's parent, but ulpi_unregister_interface tries toremove a debugfs directory named after the ulpi device itself. This resultsin the directory sticking around and preventing subsequent (deferred)probes from succeeding. Change the directory name to match the ulpi device.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26919` to fix the vulnerability.
