		"description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi packagematrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated InstantMessaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, requests to userprovided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses whencalculating the key validity for third-party invite events and sending pushnotifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internalinfrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user,although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the mostthorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated`federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading toSynapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IPaddress restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and`ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21273` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmatrix-synapse - 1.26.0-3\nNo subscription required",
