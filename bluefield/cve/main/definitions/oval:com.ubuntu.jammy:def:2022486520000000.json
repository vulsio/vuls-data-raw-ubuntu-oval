		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice:Fix crash by keep old cfg when update TCs more than queues There areproblems if allocated queues less than Traffic Classes. Commit a632b2a4c920(\"ice: ethtool: Prohibit improper channel config for DCB\") already disallowsetting less queues than TCs. Another case is if we first set less queues,and later update more TCs config due to LLDP, ice_vsi_cfg_tc() will failedbut left dirty num_txq/rxq and tc_cfg in vsi, that will cause invalidpointer access.
