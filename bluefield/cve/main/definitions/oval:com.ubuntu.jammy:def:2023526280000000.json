		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nftables: exthdr: fix 4-byte stack OOB write If priv->len is amultiple of 4, then dst[len / 4] can write past the destination array whichleads to stack corruption. This construct is necessary to clean theremainder of the register in case ->len is NOT a multiple of the registersize, so make it conditional just like nft_payload.c does. The bug wasadded in 4.1 cycle and then copied/inherited when tcp/sctp and ip optionsupport was added. Bug reported by Zero Day Initiative project(ZDI-CAN-21950, ZDI-CAN-21951, ZDI-CAN-21961).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52628` to fix the vulnerability.
