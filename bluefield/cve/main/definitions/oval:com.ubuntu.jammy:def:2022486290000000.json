		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled The generatefunction in struct rng_alg expects that the destination buffer iscompletely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read() can run into asituation where the buffer is partially filled with randomness and theremaining part of the buffer is zeroed since qcom_rng_generate() doesn'tcheck the return value. This issue can be reproduced by running thefollowing from libkcapi: kcapi-rng -b 9000000 > OUTFILE The generatedOUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all zeros, and this iscaused by the code where the test 'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.Let's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns with afull buffer if the function returns success. Let's also haveqcom_rng_generate() return the correct value. Here's some statistics fromthe ent project (https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows informationabout the quality of the generated numbers: $ ent -c qcom-random-beforeValue Char Occurrences Fraction 0 606748 0.067416 1 33104 0.003678 2 330010.003667 ... 253 � 32883 0.003654 254 � 33035 0.003671 255 � 33239 0.003693Total: 9000000 1.000000 Entropy = 7.811590 bits per byte. Optimumcompression would reduce the size of this 9000000 byte file by 2 percent.Chi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 9329962.81, and randomlywould exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times. Arithmeticmean value of data bytes is 119.3731 (127.5 = random). Monte Carlo valuefor Pi is 3.197293333 (error 1.77 percent). Serial correlation coefficientis 0.159130 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0). Without this patch, the resultsof the chi-square test is 0.01%, and the numbers are certainly not randomaccording to ent's project page. The results improve with this patch: $ ent-c qcom-random-after Value Char Occurrences Fraction 0 35432 0.003937 135127 0.003903 2 35424 0.003936 ... 253 � 35201 0.003911 254 � 348350.003871 255 � 35368 0.003930 Total: 9000000 1.000000 Entropy = 7.999979bits per byte.
