Unregistering the slaveinterfaces is unnecessary and unhelpful. Instead, after the slaves havestopped being uppers of the DSA master, we can now reset to NULL themaster->dsa_ptr pointer, which will make DSA start ignoring all futurenotifier events on the master.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48808` to fix the vulnerability.
