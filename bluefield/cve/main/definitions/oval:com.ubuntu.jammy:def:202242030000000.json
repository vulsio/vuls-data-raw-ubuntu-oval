		"title": "CVE-2022-4203 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for NVIDIA BlueField (jammy) - medium",
		"description": "A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs aftercertificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to havesigned the malicious certificate or for the application to continuecertificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trustedissuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead toa denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in thedisclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitiveplaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading tomemory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In aTLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In aTLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests clientauthentication and a malicious client connects.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-4203` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.8\nopenssl - 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.8\nNo subscription required",
