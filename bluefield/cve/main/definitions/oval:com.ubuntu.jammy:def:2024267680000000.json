		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:LoongArch: Change acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] to acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC]With default config, the value of NR_CPUS is 64. When HW platform has morethen 64 cpus, system will crash on these platforms. MAX_CORE_PIC is themaximum cpu number in MADT table (max physical number) which can exceed thesupported maximum cpu number (NR_CPUS, max logical number), but kernelshould not crash. Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, let the remaindercpus stay in BIOS. The potential crash reason is that the arrayacpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] can be overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it isobvious that CORE_PIC should be corresponding to physical core rather thanlogical core, so it is better to define the array asacpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC]. With the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpuswith qemu parameter -smp 128, otherwise system will crash with thefollowing message.
