		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ata: pata_macio: Fix DMA table overflowKolbjørn and Jonáš reported that their 32-bit PowerMacs were crashingin pata-macio since commit 09fe2bfa6b83 (\"ata: pata_macio: Fixmax_segment_size with PAGE_SIZE == 64K\").For example:  kernel BUG at drivers/ata/pata_macio.c:544!
