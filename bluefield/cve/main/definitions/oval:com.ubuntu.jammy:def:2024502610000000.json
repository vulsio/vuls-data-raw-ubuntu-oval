		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:macsec: Fix use-after-free while sending the offloading packetKASAN reports the following UAF. The metadata_dst, which is used tostore the SCI value for macsec offload, is already freed bymetadata_dst_free() in macsec_free_netdev(), while driver still use itfor sending the packet.To fix this issue, dst_release() is used instead to releasemetadata_dst. So it is not freed instantly in macsec_free_netdev() ifstill referenced by skb.
