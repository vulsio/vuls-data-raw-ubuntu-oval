		"description": "mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. Inmitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to performHTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that amalicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxyas part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxywould only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests.A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, butit does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usualmitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom accesscontrol checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protectan HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixedin mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.",
