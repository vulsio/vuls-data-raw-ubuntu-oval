		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: cancel nfsd_shrinker_work using sync mode in nfs4_state_shutdown_netIn the normal case, when we excute `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads`, thefunction `nfs4_state_destroy_net` in `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` willrelease all resources related to the hashed `nfs4_client`. If the`nfsd_client_shrinker` is running concurrently, the `expire_client`function will first unhash this client and then destroy it. This canlead to the following warning. Additionally, numerous use-after-freeerrors may occur as well.nfsd_client_shrinker         echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threadsexpire_client                nfsd_shutdown_net  unhash_client                ...                               nfs4_state_shutdown_net                                 /* won't wait shrinker exit */  /*                             cancel_work(&nn->nfsd_shrinker_work)   * nfsd_file for this          /* won't destroy unhashed client1 */   * client1 still alive         nfs4_state_destroy_net   */                               nfsd_file_cache_shutdown                                 /* trigger warning */                                 kmem_cache_destroy(nfsd_file_slab)                                 kmem_cache_destroy(nfsd_file_mark_slab)  /* release nfsd_file and mark */  __destroy_client====================================================================BUG nfsd_file (Not tainted): Objects remaining in nfsd_file on__kmem_cache_shutdown()--------------------------------------------------------------------CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 764 Comm: sh Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3+ #1 dump_stack_lvl+0x53/0x70 slab_err+0xb0/0xf0 __kmem_cache_shutdown+0x15c/0x310 kmem_cache_destroy+0x66/0x160 nfsd_file_cache_shutdown+0xac/0x210 [nfsd] nfsd_destroy_serv+0x251/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsd_svc+0x125/0x1e0 [nfsd] write_threads+0x16a/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsctl_transaction_write+0x74/0xa0 [nfsd] vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0 ksys_write+0xc1/0x160 do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e====================================================================BUG nfsd_file_mark (Tainted: G    B   W         ): Objects remainingnfsd_file_mark on __kmem_cache_shutdown()-------------------------------------------------------------------- dump_stack_lvl+0x53/0x70 slab_err+0xb0/0xf0 __kmem_cache_shutdown+0x15c/0x310 kmem_cache_destroy+0x66/0x160 nfsd_file_cache_shutdown+0xc8/0x210 [nfsd] nfsd_destroy_serv+0x251/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsd_svc+0x125/0x1e0 [nfsd] write_threads+0x16a/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsctl_transaction_write+0x74/0xa0 [nfsd] vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0 ksys_write+0xc1/0x160 do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7eTo resolve this issue, cancel `nfsd_shrinker_work` using synchronousmode in nfs4_state_shutdown_net.",
