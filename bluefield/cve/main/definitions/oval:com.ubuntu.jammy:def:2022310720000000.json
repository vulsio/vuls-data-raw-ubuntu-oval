		"description": "Octokit is a Ruby toolkit for the GitHub API. Versions 4.23.0 and 4.24.0 ofthe octokit gem were published containing world-writeable files.Specifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to`-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). This meanseveryone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to theinstance where this release had been installed could modify theworld-writable files from this gem. This issue is patched in Octokit4.25.0. Two workarounds are available. Users can use the previous versionof the gem, v4.22.0. Alternatively, users can modify the file permissionsmanually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.",
