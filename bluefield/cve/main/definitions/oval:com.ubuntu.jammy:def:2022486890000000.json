		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tcp: TXzerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status We got a recent syzbot report[1] showing a possible misuse of pfmemalloc page status in TCP zerocopypaths. Indeed, for pages coming from user space or other layers, usingpage_is_pfmemalloc() is moot, and possibly could give false positives.There has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust, but notusing it in the first place in this context is probably better, removingcpu cycles. Note to stable teams : You need to backport 84ce071e38a6 (\"net:introduce __skb_fill_page_desc_noacc\") as a prereq. Race is more probableafter commit c07aea3ef4d4 (\"mm: add a signature in struct page\") becausepage_is_pfmemalloc() is now using low order bit from page->lru.next, whichcan change more often than page->index. Low order bit should never be setfor lru.next (when used as an anchor in LRU list), so KCSAN report ismostly a false positive. Backporting to older kernel versions seems notnecessary.
