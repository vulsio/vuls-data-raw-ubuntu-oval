		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: fix oops caused by irqsoff latency tracerThe trace_hardirqs_{on,off}() require the caller to setup frame pointerproperly. This because these two functions use macro 'CALLER_ADDR1' (aka.__builtin_return_address(1)) to acquire caller info. If the $fp is usedfor other purpose, the code generated this macro (as below) could triggermemory access fault.   0xffffffff8011510e <+80>:    ld      a1,-16(s0)   0xffffffff80115112 <+84>:    ld      s2,-8(a1)  # <-- paging fault hereThe oops message during booting if compiled with 'irqoff' tracer enabled:[    0.039615][    T0] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference atvirtual address 00000000000000f8[    0.041925][    T0] Oops [#1][    0.042063][    T0] Modules linked in:[    0.042864][    T0] CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted5.17.0-rc1-00233-g9a20c48d1ed2 #29[    0.043568][    T0] Hardware name: riscv-virtio,qemu (DT)[    0.044343][    T0] epc : trace_hardirqs_on+0x56/0xe2[    0.044601][    T0]  ra : restore_all+0x12/0x6e[    0.044721][    T0] epc : ffffffff80126a5c ra : ffffffff80003b94 sp :ffffffff81403db0[    0.044801][    T0]  gp : ffffffff8163acd8 tp : ffffffff81414880 t0 :0000000000000020[    0.044882][    T0]  t1 : 0098968000000000 t2 : 0000000000000000 s0 :ffffffff81403de0[    0.044967][    T0]  s1 : 0000000000000000 a0 : 0000000000000001 a1 :0000000000000100[    0.045046][    T0]  a2 : 0000000000000000 a3 : 0000000000000000 a4 :0000000000000000[    0.045124][    T0]  a5 : 0000000000000000 a6 : 0000000000000000 a7 :0000000054494d45[    0.045210][    T0]  s2 : ffffffff80003b94 s3 : ffffffff81a8f1b0 s4 :ffffffff80e27b50[    0.045289][    T0]  s5 : ffffffff81414880 s6 : ffffffff8160fa00 s7 :00000000800120e8[    0.045389][    T0]  s8 : 0000000080013100 s9 : 000000000000007f s10:0000000000000000[    0.045474][    T0]  s11: 0000000000000000 t3 : 7fffffffffffffff t4 :0000000000000000[    0.045548][    T0]  t5 : 0000000000000000 t6 : ffffffff814aa368[    0.045620][    T0] status: 0000000200000100 badaddr: 00000000000000f8cause: 000000000000000d[    0.046402][    T0] [<ffffffff80003b94>] restore_all+0x12/0x6eThis because the $fp(aka. $s0) register is not used as frame pointer in theassembly entry code.\tresume_kernel:\t\tREG_L s0, TASK_TI_PREEMPT_COUNT(tp)\t\tbnez s0, restore_all\t\tREG_L s0, TASK_TI_FLAGS(tp)                andi s0, s0, _TIF_NEED_RESCHED                beqz s0, restore_all                call preempt_schedule_irq                j restore_allTo fix above issue, here we add one extra level wrapper for functiontrace_hardirqs_{on,off}() so they can be safely called by low level entrycode.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48922` to fix the vulnerability.
