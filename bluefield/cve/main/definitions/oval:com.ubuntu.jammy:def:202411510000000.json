		"description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Open vSwitch sub-component in the LinuxKernel. The flaw occurs when a recursive operation of code push recursivelycalls into the code block. The OVS module does not validate the stackdepth, pushing too many frames and causing a stack overflow. As a result,this can lead to a crash or other related issues.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-1151` to fix the vulnerability.
