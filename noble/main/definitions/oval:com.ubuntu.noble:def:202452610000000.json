		"description": "Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice\"LibreOfficeKit\" mode disables TLS certification verificationLibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality throughC/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuseLibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact withdocuments. LibreOffice internally makes use of \"curl\" to fetch remoteresources such as images hosted on webservers. In affected versions ofLibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode only, then curl's TLScertification verification was disabled (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)In the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as instandard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true. This issue affectsLibreOffice before version 24.2.4.",
