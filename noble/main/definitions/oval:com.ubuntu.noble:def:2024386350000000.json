		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soundwire: cadence: fix invalid PDI offset For some reason, we add anoffset to the PDI, presumably to skip the PDI0 and PDI1 which are reservedfor BPT. This code is however completely wrong and leads to anout-of-bounds access. We were just lucky so far since we used only a coupleof PDIs and remained within the PDI array bounds. A Fixes: tag is notprovided since there are no known platforms where the out-of-bounds wouldbe accessed, and the initial code had problems as well. A follow-up patchcompletely removes this useless offset.",
