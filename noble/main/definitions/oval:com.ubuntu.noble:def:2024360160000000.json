		"title": "CVE-2024-36016 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tty:n_gsm: fix possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive() Assuming the following:- side A configures the n_gsm in basic option mode - side B sends theheader of a basic option mode frame with data length 1 - side A switches toadvanced option mode - side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds gsm->lenReason: gsm->len is not used in advanced option mode. - side A switches tobasic option mode - side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes pastgsm->buf Reason: Neither gsm->state nor gsm->len have been reset afterreconfiguration. Fix this by changing gsm->count to gsm->len comparisonfrom equal to less than. Also add upper limit checks against the constantMAX_MRU in gsm0_receive() and gsm1_receive() to harden against memorycorruption of gsm->len and gsm->mru. All other checks remain as we stillneed to limit the data according to the user configuration and actualpayload size.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36016` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-39-generic - 6.8.0-39.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-39-generic - 6.8.0-39.39\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-39-generic-64k - 6.8.0-39.39\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1012-aws - 6.8.0-1012.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1012-azure - 6.8.0-1012.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1011-gcp - 6.8.0-1011.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-gke - 6.8.0-1007.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1009-ibm - 6.8.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-39-lowlatency - 6.8.0-39.39.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-39-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-39.39.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oracle - 6.8.0-1010.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1008-raspi - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1009-oem - 6.8.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1008.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-2007-raspi-realtime - 6.8.0-2007.7\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.1-1005-realtime - 6.8.1-1005.5\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
