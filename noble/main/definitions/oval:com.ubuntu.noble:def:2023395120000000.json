		"description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault managementframework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison datastored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed byadministrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim'sbrowser at view-time. The script under `data_sources.php` displays the datasource management information (e.g. data source path, pollingconfiguration, device name related to the datasource etc.) for differentdata visualizations of the _cacti_ app. _CENSUS_ found that an adversarythat is able to configure a malicious device name, can deploy a stored XSSattack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user thatpossesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions canconfigure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through`http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload isexhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This vulnerability hasbeen addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Usersunable to update should manually filter HTML output.",
