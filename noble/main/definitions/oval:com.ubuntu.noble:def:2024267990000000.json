		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: qcom: Fix uninitialized pointer dmactlIn the case where __lpass_get_dmactl_handle is called and the driverid dai_id is invalid the pointer dmactl is not being assigned a value,and dmactl contains a garbage value since it has not been initializedand so the null check may not work. Fix this to initialize dmactl toNULL. One could argue that modern compilers will set this to zero, butit is useful to keep this initialized as per the same way in functions__lpass_platform_codec_intf_init and lpass_cdc_dma_daiops_hw_params.Cleans up clang scan build warning:sound/soc/qcom/lpass-cdc-dma.c:275:7: warning: Branch conditionevaluates to a garbage value [core.uninitialized.Branch]",
