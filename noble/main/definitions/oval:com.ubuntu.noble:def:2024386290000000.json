		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida file_ida isallocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly during cdev release.This sequence is guaranteed by driver file operations. Therefore, there isno need to destroy an already empty file_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.Worse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of file_idaper WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida after it has beendestroyed, resulting in a kernel panic. Remove ida_destroy(&file_ida) toaddress these issues.",
