		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KEYS:trusted: Do not use WARN when encode fails When asn1_encode_sequence()fails, WARN is not the correct solution. 1. asn1_encode_sequence() is notan internal function (located in lib/asn1_encode.c). 2. Location is known,which makes the stack trace useless. 3. Results a crash if panic_on_warn isset. It is also noteworthy that the use of WARN is undocumented, and itshould be avoided unless there is a carefully considered rationale to useit. Replace WARN with pr_err, and print the return value instead, which isonly useful piece of information.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36975` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-40-generic - 6.8.0-40.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-40-generic - 6.8.0-40.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-40-generic-64k - 6.8.0-40.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1013-aws - 6.8.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1012-gcp - 6.8.0-1012.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-gke - 6.8.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-ibm - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oracle - 6.8.0-1010.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oem - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required",
