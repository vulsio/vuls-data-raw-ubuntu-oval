		"title": "CVE-2022-29187 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. (noble) - medium",
		"description": "Git is a distributed revision control system. Git prior to versions 2.37.1,2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5, is vulnerableto privilege escalation in all platforms. An unsuspecting user could stillbe affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765, for example whennavigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, butwhere an attacker could create a git repository. Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2,2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a patch for thisissue. The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described inthe example is to avoid running git as root (or an Administrator inWindows), and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum. While a genericworkaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploitdescribed in the example by removing any such repository if it existsalready and creating one as root to block any future attacks.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29187` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngit - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-all - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-cvs - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-daemon-run - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-daemon-sysvinit - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-email - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-gui - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-man - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-mediawiki - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngit-svn - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngitk - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\ngitweb - 1:2.36.1-1ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
