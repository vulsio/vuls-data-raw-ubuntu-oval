		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix interrupt exit race with security mitigationswitch The RFI and STF security mitigation options can flip theinterrupt_exit_not_reentrant static branch condition concurrently with theinterrupt exit code which tests that branch. Interrupt exit tests thiscondition to set MSR[EE|RI] for exit, then again in the case a soft-maskedinterrupt is found pending, to recover the MSR so the interrupt can bereplayed before attempting to exit again. If the condition changes betweenthese two tests, the MSR and irq soft-mask state will become corrupted,leading to warnings and possible crashes. For example, if the branch isinitially true then false, MSR[EE] will be 0 but PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS clearand EE may not get enabled, leading to warnings in irq_64.c.",
