		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: libbpf:Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF Inbpf_objec_load_prog(), there's no guarantee that obj->btf is non-NULL whenpassing it to btf__fd(), and this function does not perform any checkbefore dereferencing its argument (as bpf_object__btf_fd() used to do). Asa consequence, we get segmentation fault errors in bpftool (for example)when trying to load programs that come without BTF information. v2: Keepbtf__fd() in the fix instead of reverting to bpf_object__btf_fd().",
