		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command The isd200sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values in the ATA IDinformation to calculate cylinder and head values when creating a CDB forREAD or WRITE commands. The calculation involves division and modulusoperations, which will cause a crash if either of these values is 0. Whilethis never happens with a genuine device, it could happen with a flawed orsubversive emulation, as reported by the syzbot fuzzer. Protect againstthis possibility by refusing to bind to the device if either theATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID information is 0.This requires isd200_Initialization() to return a negative error code wheninitialization fails; currently it always returns 0 (even when there is anerror).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27059` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-20-generic - 6.8.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-20-generic - 6.8.0-20.20\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-20-generic-64k - 6.8.0-20.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-aws - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-azure - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-gcp - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-ibm - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-25-lowlatency - 6.8.0-25.25.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-25-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-25.25.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1004-oracle - 6.8.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1002-raspi - 6.8.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1001.6\nNo subscription required",
