		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mcb:fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus() There are two bugs: 1) Ifida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier) but wehaven't yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that leads to a useafter free. 2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device()to release the bus. This will free the internal resources tied to thedevice and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.",
