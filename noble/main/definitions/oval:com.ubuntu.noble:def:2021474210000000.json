		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: handle the case of pci_channel_io_frozen only inamdgpu_pci_resumeIn current code, when a PCI error state pci_channel_io_normal is detectd,it will report PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER status to PCI driver, and PCIdriver will continue the execution of PCI resume callback report_resume bypci_walk_bridge, and the callback will go into amdgpu_pci_resumefinally, where write lock is releasd unconditionally without acquiringsuch lock first. In this case, a deadlock will happen when other threadsstart to acquire the read lock.To fix this, add a member in amdgpu_device strucutre to cachepci_channel_state, and only continue the execution in amdgpu_pci_resumewhen it's pci_channel_io_frozen.",
