		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: handle the case of pci_channel_io_frozen only inamdgpu_pci_resume In current code, when a PCI error statepci_channel_io_normal is detectd, it will report PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVERstatus to PCI driver, and PCI driver will continue the execution of PCIresume callback report_resume by pci_walk_bridge, and the callback will gointo amdgpu_pci_resume finally, where write lock is releasd unconditionallywithout acquiring such lock first. In this case, a deadlock will happenwhen other threads start to acquire the read lock. To fix this, add amember in amdgpu_device strucutre to cache pci_channel_state, and onlycontinue the execution in amdgpu_pci_resume when it'spci_channel_io_frozen.",
