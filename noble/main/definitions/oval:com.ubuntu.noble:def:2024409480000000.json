		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/page_table_check: fix crash on ZONE_DEVICENot all pages may apply to pgtable check.  One example is ZONE_DEVICEpages: they map PFNs directly, and they don't allocate page_ext at alleven if there's struct page around.  One may referencedevm_memremap_pages().When both ZONE_DEVICE and page-table-check enabled, then try to map somedax memories, one can trigger kernel bug constantly now when the kernelwas trying to inject some pfn maps on the dax device: kernel BUG at mm/page_table_check.c:55!While it's pretty legal to use set_pxx_at() for ZONE_DEVICE pages for pagefault resolutions, skip all the checks if page_ext doesn't even exist inpgtable checker, which applies to ZONE_DEVICE but maybe more.",
