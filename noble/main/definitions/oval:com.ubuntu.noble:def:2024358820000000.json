		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCPJan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memoryexhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commite18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a singlesock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit.That commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages inthe underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't.svc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but therecord marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is neverreleased.This is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. Amore extensive fix is in the works.",
