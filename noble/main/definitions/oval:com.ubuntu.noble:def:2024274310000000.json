		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: cpumap:Zero-initialise xdp_rxq_info struct before running XDP program When runningan XDP program that is attached to a cpumap entry, we don't initialise thexdp_rxq_info data structure being used in the xdp_buff that backs the XDPprogram invocation. Tobias noticed that this leads to random values beingreturned as the xdp_md->rx_queue_index value for XDP programs running in acpumap. This means we're basically returning the contents of theuninitialised memory, which is bad. Fix this by zero-initialising the rxqdata structure before running the XDP program.",
