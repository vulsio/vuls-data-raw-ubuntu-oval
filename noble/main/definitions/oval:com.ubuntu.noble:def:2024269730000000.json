		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fat:fix uninitialized field in nostale filehandles When fat_encode_fh_nostale()encodes file handle without a parent it stores only first 10 bytes of thefile handle. However the length of the file handle must be a multiple of 4so the file handle is actually 12 bytes long and the last two bytes remainuninitialized. This is not great at we potentially leak uninitializedinformation with the handle to userspace. Properly initialize the fullhandle length.",
