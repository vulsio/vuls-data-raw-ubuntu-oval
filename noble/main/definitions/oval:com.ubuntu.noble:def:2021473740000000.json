		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dma-debug: prevent an error message from causing runtime problems For somedrivers, that use the DMA API. This error message can be reached severalmillions of times per second, causing spam to the kernel's printk bufferand bringing the CPU usage up to 100% (so, it should be rate limited).However, since there is at least one driver that is in the mainline andsuffers from the error condition, it is more useful to err_printk() hereinstead of just rate limiting the error message (in hopes that it will makeit easier for other drivers that suffer from this issue to be spotted).",
