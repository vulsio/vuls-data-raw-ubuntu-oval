		"description": "NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communicationtechnology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing. Thecryptographic key handling library, nkeys, recently gained support forencryption, not just for signing/authentication. This is used innats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeysversions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5, corresponding with NATS server versions2.10.0 through 2.10.3, the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handlinglogic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function, wherethe function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. Asa result, all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affectsencryption only, not signing. FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTHCALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6, corresponding with NATS Server2.10.4, has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. Forany application handling auth callouts in Go, if using the nkeys library,update the dependency, recompile and deploy that in lockstep.",
