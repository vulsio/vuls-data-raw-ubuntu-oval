		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tun: add missing verification for short frameThe cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame lengthin the tun_xdp_one() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be sentdownstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, thetun_xdp_one-->eth_type_trans() may access the Ethernet header although itcan be less than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either causeout-of-bound access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayerwith incorrect or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.In the alternative path, tun_get_user() already prohibits short frame whichhas the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted forIFF_TAP.This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just likehow tun_get_user() does.CVE: CVE-2024-41091",
