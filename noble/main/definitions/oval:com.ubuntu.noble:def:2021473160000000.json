		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix NULL dereference in nfs3svc_encode_getaclresIn error cases the dentry may be NULL.Before 20798dfe249a, the encoder also checked dentry andd_really_is_positive(dentry), but that looks like overkill to me--zerostatus should be enough to guarantee a positive dentry.This isn't the first time we've seen an error-case NULL dereferencehidden in the initialization of a local variable in an xdr encoder.  ButI went back through the other recent rewrites and didn't spot anysimilar bugs.",
