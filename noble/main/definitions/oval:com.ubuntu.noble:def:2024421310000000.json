		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logicThe dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirtylimits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplicationsfit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger, we will hit overflows,possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing solarge dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  Fordirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to setso large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't sosimple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memorywhich can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirtylimits from ratios to numbers of pages, we just don't allow the result toexceed UINT_MAX.This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operatorsets dirty limits to >16 TB.",
