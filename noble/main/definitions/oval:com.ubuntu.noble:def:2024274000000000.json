		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdgpu: once more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2This reverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event amdgpu_bo_move always moveon same heap. The basic problem here is that after the move the oldlocation is simply not available any more.Some fixes were suggested, but essentially we should call the movenotification before actually moving things because only this way we havethe correct order for DMA-buf and VM move notifications as well.Also rework the statistic handling so that we don't update the evictioncounter before the move.v2: add missing NULL check",
