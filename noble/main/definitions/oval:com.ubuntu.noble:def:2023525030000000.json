		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tee:amdtee: fix use-after-free vulnerability in amdtee_close_session There is apotential race condition in amdtee_close_session that may causeuse-after-free in amdtee_open_session. For instance, if a session hasrefcount == 1, and one thread tries to free this session via:kref_put(&sess->refcount, destroy_session); the reference count will getdecremented, and the next step would be to call destroy_session(). However,if in another thread, amdtee_open_session() is called beforedestroy_session() has completed execution, alloc_session() may return'sess' that will be freed up later in destroy_session() leading touse-after-free in amdtee_open_session. To fix this issue, treat decrementof sess->refcount and removal of 'sess' from session list indestroy_session() as a critical section, so that it is executed atomically.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52503` to fix the vulnerability.
