		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: leds:trigger: netdev: Fix kernel panic on interface rename trig notify Commitd5e01266e7f5 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: add additional specific link speedmode\") in the various changes, reworked the way to set the LINKUP mode incommit cee4bd16c319 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: Recheck NETDEV_LED_MODE_LINKUPon dev rename\") and moved it to a generic function. This changed the logicwhere, in the previous implementation the dev from the trigger event wasused to check if the carrier was ok, but in the new implementation with thegeneric function, the dev in trigger_data is used instead. This isproblematic and cause a possible kernel panic due to the fact that the devin the trigger_data still reference the old one as the new one (passed fromthe trigger event) still has to be hold and saved in the trigger_datastruct (done in the NETDEV_REGISTER case). On calling ofget_device_state(), an invalid net_dev is used and this cause a kernelpanic. To handle this correctly, move the call to get_device_state() afterthe new net_dev is correctly set in trigger_data (in the NETDEV_REGISTERcase) and correctly parse the new dev.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27063` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic-64k - 6.8.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1009-aws - 6.8.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-gcp - 6.8.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-ibm - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1005-raspi - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required",
