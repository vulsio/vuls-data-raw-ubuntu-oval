		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: clk:mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probe mt8183-mfgcfg hasa mutual dependency with genpd during the probing stage, which leads to adeadlock in the following call stack: CPU0: genpd_lock --> clk_prepare_lockgenpd_power_off_work_fn() genpd_lock() generic_pm_domain::power_off()clk_unprepare() clk_prepare_lock() CPU1: clk_prepare_lock --> genpd_lockclk_register() __clk_core_init() clk_prepare_lock() clk_pm_runtime_get()genpd_lock() Do a runtime PM get at the probe function to make sureclk_register() won't acquire the genpd lock. Instead of only modifyingmt8183-mfgcfg, do this on all mediatek clock controller probings because wedon't believe this would cause any regression. Verified on MT8183 andMT8192 Chromebooks.",
