		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vfio/type1: Unpin zero pages There's currently a reference count leak onthe zero page. We increment the reference via pin_user_pages_remote(), butthe page is later handled as an invalid/reserved page, therefore it's notaccounted against the user and not unpinned by our put_pfn(). Introducingspecial zero page handling in put_pfn() would resolve the leak, but withoutaccounting of the zero page, a single user could still create enoughmappings to generate a reference count overflow. The zero page is alwaysresident, so for our purposes there's no reason to keep it pinned.Therefore, add a loop to walk pages returned from pin_user_pages_remote()and unpin any zero pages.",
