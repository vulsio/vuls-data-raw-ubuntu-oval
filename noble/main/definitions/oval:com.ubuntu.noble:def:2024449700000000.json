		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix invalid WQ linked list unlinkWhen all the strides in a WQE have been consumed, the WQE is unlinkedfrom the WQ linked list (mlx5_wq_ll_pop()). For SHAMPO, it is possibleto receive CQEs with 0 consumed strides for the same WQE even after theWQE is fully consumed and unlinked. This triggers an additional unlinkfor the same wqe which corrupts the linked list.Fix this scenario by accepting 0 sized consumed strides withoutunlinking the WQE again.",
