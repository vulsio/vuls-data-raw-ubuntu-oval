However, due tomsg_id reuse resulting in a successful copen, the anonymous fd is notclosed until the daemon exits. Therefore read requests waiting for reopento complete may trigger hung task.To avoid this issue, allocate the msg_id cyclically to avoid reusing themsg_id for a very short duration of time.",
