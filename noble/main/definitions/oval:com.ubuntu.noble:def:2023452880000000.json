		"description": "An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts ofheader data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS andCONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceedMaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, butthey are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpointto read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a requestwhich is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encodeddata which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode thanfor an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excessheader frames we will process before closing a connection.",
