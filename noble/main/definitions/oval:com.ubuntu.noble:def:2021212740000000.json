		"description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi packagematrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated InstantMessaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicioushomeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a largefile. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers willconsume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known fileof a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federationrequests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As aworkaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used torestrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21274` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmatrix-synapse - 1.26.0-3\nNo subscription required",
