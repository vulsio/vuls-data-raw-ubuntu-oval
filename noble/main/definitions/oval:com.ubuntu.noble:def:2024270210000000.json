		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: r8169:fix LED-related deadlock on module removal Bindingdevm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematic because on moduleremoval we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix this by avoiding thedevice-managed LED functions. Note: We can safely callled_classdev_unregister() for a LED even if registering it failed, becauseled_classdev_unregister() detects this and is a no-op in this case.",
