		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ceph:prevent use-after-free in encode_cap_msg() In fs/ceph/caps.c, inencode_cap_msg(), \"use after free\" error was caught by KASAN at this line -'ceph_buffer_get(arg->xattr_buf);'. This implies before the refcount couldbe increment here, it was freed. In same file, in \"handle_cap_grant()\"refcount is decremented by this line -'ceph_buffer_put(ci->i_xattrs.blob);'. It appears that a race occurred andresource was freed by the latter line before the former line couldincrement it. encode_cap_msg() is called by __send_cap() and __send_cap()is called by ceph_check_caps() after calling __prep_cap(). __prep_cap() iswhere arg->xattr_buf is assigned to ci->i_xattrs.blob. This is the spotwhere the refcount must be increased to prevent \"use after free\" error.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26689` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-11-generic - 6.8.0-11.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-11-generic - 6.8.0-11.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-11-generic-64k - 6.8.0-11.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-aws - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-azure - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1002-gcp - 6.8.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-ibm - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-25-lowlatency - 6.8.0-25.25.3\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-25-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-25.25.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1004-oracle - 6.8.0-1004.4\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1004-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1001-raspi - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1001.6\nNo subscription required",
