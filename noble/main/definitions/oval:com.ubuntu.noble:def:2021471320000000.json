		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mptcp:fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission MPTCP sk_forward_memoryhandling is a bit special, as such field is protected by the msk socketspin_lock, instead of the plain socket lock. Currently we have a code pathupdating such field without handling the relevant lock: __mptcp_retrans()-> __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() Several helpers in __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup()will update sk_forward_alloc, possibly causing such field corruption, asreported by Matthieu. Address the issue providing and using a new variantof blamed function which explicitly acquires the msk spin lock.",
