		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: md: fixresync softlockup when bitmap size is less than array size Is is reportedthat for dm-raid10, lvextend + lvchange --syncaction will trigger followingsoftlockup: kernel:watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#3 stuck for 26s![mdX_resync:6976] CPU: 7 PID: 3588 Comm: mdX_resync Kdump: loaded Nottainted 6.9.0-rc4-next-20240419 #1 RIP: 0010:_raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x13/0x30Call Trace: <TASK> md_bitmap_start_sync+0x6b/0xf0raid10_sync_request+0x25c/0x1b40 [raid10] md_do_sync+0x64b/0x1020md_thread+0xa7/0x170 kthread+0xcf/0x100 ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 And the detailed process is as follows:md_do_sync j = mddev->resync_min while (j < max_sectors) sectors =raid10_sync_request(mddev, j, &skipped) if (!md_bitmap_start_sync(...,&sync_blocks)) // md_bitmap_start_sync set sync_blocks to 0 returnsync_blocks + sectors_skippe; // sectors = 0; j += sectors; // j neverchange Root cause is that commit 301867b1c168 (\"md/raid10: checkslab-out-of-bounds in md_bitmap_get_counter\") return early frommd_bitmap_get_counter(), without setting returned blocks. Fix this problemby always set returned blocks from md_bitmap_get_counter\"(), as it used tobe. Noted that this patch just fix the softlockup problem in kernel, thecase that bitmap size doesn't match array size still need to be fixed.",
