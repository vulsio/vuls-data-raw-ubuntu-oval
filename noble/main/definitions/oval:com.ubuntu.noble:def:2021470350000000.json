		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries When thefirst level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only supportsRead-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission is notsupported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should always set.When using second level, we still give separate permissions that allowsWriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to have consistentbehavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things to worksometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings. Henceremove this configuration.",
