		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm:zswap: fix missing folio cleanup in writeback race path Inzswap_writeback_entry(), after we get a folio from__read_swap_cache_async(), we grab the tree lock again to check that theswap entry was not invalidated and recycled. If it was, we delete the foliowe just added to the swap cache and exit. However,__read_swap_cache_async() returns the folio locked when it is newlyallocated, which is always true for this path, and the folio is ref'd. Makesure to unlock and put the folio before returning. This was discovered bycode inspection, probably because this path handles a race condition thatshould not happen often, and the bug would not crash the system, it willonly strand the folio indefinitely.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26832` to fix the vulnerability.
