		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: gfs2:Fix use-after-free in gfs2_glock_shrink_scan The GLF_LRU flag is checkedunder lru_lock in gfs2_glock_remove_from_lru() to remove the glock from thelru list in __gfs2_glock_put(). On the shrink scan path, the same flag iscleared under lru_lock but because of cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) ingfs2_dispose_glock_lru(), progress on the put side can be made withoutdeleting the glock from the lru list. Keep GLF_LRU across the race windowopened by cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) to ensure correct behavior on bothsides - clear GLF_LRU after list_del under lru_lock.",
