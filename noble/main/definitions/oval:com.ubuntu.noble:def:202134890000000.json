		"description": "The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did notcheck that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowingan attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the kernel andtherefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit4b81ccebaeee (\"bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf\")(v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, andv5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88 (\"bpf: Implement BPF ringbuffer and verifier support for it\") (v5.8-rc1).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3489` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-9-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic - 5.15.0-25.25\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic-64k - 5.15.0-25.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 5.15.0-1004.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 5.15.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-gcp - 5.15.0-1003.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-oracle - 5.15.0-1002.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1005-raspi - 5.15.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 5.15.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency - 5.15.0-24.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency-64k - 5.15.0-24.24\nNo subscription required",
