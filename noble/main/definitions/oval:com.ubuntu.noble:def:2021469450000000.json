		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:always panic when errors=panic is specified Before commit 014c9caa29d3(\"ext4: make ext4_abort() use __ext4_error()\"), the following series ofcommands would trigger a panic: 1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test After commit 014c9caa29d3,remounting a file system using the test mount option \"abort\" will no longertrigger a panic. This commit will restore the behaviour immediately beforecommit 014c9caa29d3. (However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior hasnot been consistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19similarly did not panic after using the mount option \"abort\".) This alsomakes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the following seriescommands will now cause a panic, when previously it did not: 1. mount/dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test 2. echo test >/sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error However, this makes ext4's behaviour muchmore consistent, so this is a good thing.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46945` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic-64k - 6.5.0-9.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-gcp - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-oracle - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1005-raspi - 6.5.0-1005.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1001.6\nNo subscription required",
