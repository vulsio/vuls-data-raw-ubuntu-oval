		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder:signal epoll threads of self-work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend onI/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption. Within binder,a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read bufferand then make use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responsesafterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeupwhen they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitelyfor an event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequentcommands won't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26606` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-11-generic - 6.8.0-11.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-11-generic - 6.8.0-11.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-11-generic-64k - 6.8.0-11.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-aws - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-azure - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1002-gcp - 6.8.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-ibm - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-7-lowlatency - 6.8.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-oracle - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1001-raspi - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1005.12\nNo subscription required",
