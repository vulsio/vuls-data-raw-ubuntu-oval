		"description": "NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain codepath that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a featurethat removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client'sadvertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however, itwould try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records wouldresult in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to anunchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records couldloop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDEinformation on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smallerthan the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only betriggered when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration.From version 1.19.2 on, the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.",
