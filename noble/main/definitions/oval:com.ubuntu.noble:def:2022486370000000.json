		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bnxt:prevent skb UAF after handing over to PTP worker When reading the timestampis required bnxt_tx_int() hands over the ownership of the completed skb tothe PTP worker. The skb should not be used afterwards, as the worker mayrun before the rest of our code and free the skb, leading to ause-after-free. Since dev_kfree_skb_any() accepts NULL make the loss ofownership more obvious and set skb to NULL.",
