		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: phy:ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered Thepower_supply frame-work is not really designed for there to be long livingin kernel references to power_supply devices. Specifically unregistering apower_supply while some other code has a reference to it triggers a WARN inpower_supply_unregister(): WARN_ON(atomic_dec_return(&psy->use_cnt));Folllowed by the power_supply still getting removed and the backing datafreed anyway, leaving the tusb1210 charger-detect code with a danglingreference, resulting in a crash the next time tusb1210_get_online() iscalled. Fix this by only holding the reference in tusb1210_get_online()freeing it at the end of the function. Note this still leaves a theoreticalrace window, but it avoids the issue when manually rmmod-ing the chargerchip driver during development.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35986` to fix the vulnerability.
