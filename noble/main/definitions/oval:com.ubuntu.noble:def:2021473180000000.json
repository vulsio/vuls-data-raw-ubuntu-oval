		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arch_topology: Avoid use-after-free for scale_freq_data Currentlytopology_scale_freq_tick() (which gets called from scheduler_tick()) mayend up using a pointer to \"struct scale_freq_data\", which was previouslycleared by topology_clear_scale_freq_source(), as there is no protection inplace here. The users of topology_clear_scale_freq_source() though needs aguarantee that the previously cleared scale_freq_data isn't used anymore,so they can free the related resources. Since topology_scale_freq_tick() iscalled from scheduler tick, we don't want to add locking in there. Use theRCU update mechanism instead (which is already used by the scheduler'sutilization update path) to guarantee race free updates here.synchronize_rcu() makes sure that all RCU critical sections that startedbefore it is called, will finish before it returns. And so the callers oftopology_clear_scale_freq_source() don't need to worry about their callbackgetting called anymore.",
