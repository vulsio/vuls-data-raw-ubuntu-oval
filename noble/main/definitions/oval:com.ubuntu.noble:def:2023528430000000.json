		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: llc:verify mac len before reading mac header LLC reads the mac header witheth_hdr without verifying that the skb has an Ethernet header. Syzbot wasable to enter llc_rcv on a tun device. Tun can insert packets without maclen and with user configurable skb->protocol (passing a tun_pi header whennot configuring IFF_NO_PI). BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value inllc_station_ac_send_test_r net/llc/llc_station.c:81 [inline] BUG: KMSAN:uninit-value in llc_station_rcv+0x6fb/0x1290 net/llc/llc_station.c:111llc_station_ac_send_test_r net/llc/llc_station.c:81 [inline]llc_station_rcv+0x6fb/0x1290 net/llc/llc_station.c:111 llc_rcv+0xc5d/0x14a0net/llc/llc_input.c:218 __netif_receive_skb_one_core net/core/dev.c:5523[inline] __netif_receive_skb+0x1a6/0x5a0 net/core/dev.c:5637netif_receive_skb_internal net/core/dev.c:5723 [inline]netif_receive_skb+0x58/0x660 net/core/dev.c:5782 tun_rx_batched+0x3ee/0x980drivers/net/tun.c:1555 tun_get_user+0x54c5/0x69c0 drivers/net/tun.c:2002Add a mac_len test before all three eth_hdr(skb) calls under net/llc. Thereare further uses in include/net/llc_pdu.h. All these are protected by atest skb->protocol == ETH_P_802_2. Which does not protect against this tunscenario. But the mac_len test added in this patch in llc_fixup_skb willindirectly protect those too. That is called from llc_rcv before any otherLLC code. It is tempting to just add a blanket mac_len check in llc_rcv,but not sure whether that could break valid LLC paths that do not assume anEthernet header. 802.2 LLC may be used on top of non-802.3 protocols inprinciple. The below referenced commit shows that used to, on top of TokenRing. At least one of the three eth_hdr uses goes back to before the startof git history. But the one that syzbot exercises is introduced in thiscommit. That commit is old enough (2008), that effectively all stablekernels should receive this.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52843` to fix the vulnerability.
