A heap bufferoverflow issue was discovered in ClickHouse server. An attacker could senda specially crafted payload to the native interface exposed by default onport 9000/tcp, triggering a bug in the decompression logic of T64 codecthat crashes the ClickHouse server process. This attack does not requireauthentication. Note that this exploit can also be triggered via HTTPprotocol, however, the attacker will need a valid credential as the HTTPauthentication take places first. This issue has been fixed in version23.10.2.13-stable, 23.9.4.11-stable, 23.8.6.16-lts and 23.3.16.7-lts.",
