		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fs/9p: fix uninitialized values during inode evictIf an iget fails due to not being able to retrieve informationfrom the server then the inode structure is only partiallyinitialized.  When the inode gets evicted, references touninitialized structures (like fscache cookies) were beingmade.This patch checks for a bad_inode before doing anything otherthan clearing the inode from the cache.  Since the inode isbad, it shouldn't have any state associated with it that needsto be written back (and there really isn't a way to completethose anyways).",
