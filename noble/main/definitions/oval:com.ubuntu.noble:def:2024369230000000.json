		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs/9p:fix uninitialized values during inode evict If an iget fails due to notbeing able to retrieve information from the server then the inode structureis only partially initialized. When the inode gets evicted, references touninitialized structures (like fscache cookies) were being made. This patchchecks for a bad_inode before doing anything other than clearing the inodefrom the cache. Since the inode is bad, it shouldn't have any stateassociated with it that needs to be written back (and there really isn't away to complete those anyways).",
