		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: e1000e:change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access This is a partial revertof commit 6dbdd4de0362 (\"e1000e: Workaround for sporadic MDI error onMeteor Lake systems\"). The referenced commit used usleep_range inside thePHY access routines, which are sometimes called from an atomic context.This can lead to a kernel panic in some scenarios, such as cabledisconnection and reconnection on vPro systems. Solve this by changing theusleep_range calls back to udelay.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36887` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
