		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: e1000e:change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access This is a partial revertof commit 6dbdd4de0362 (\"e1000e: Workaround for sporadic MDI error onMeteor Lake systems\"). The referenced commit used usleep_range inside thePHY access routines, which are sometimes called from an atomic context.This can lead to a kernel panic in some scenarios, such as cabledisconnection and reconnection on vPro systems. Solve this by changing theusleep_range calls back to udelay.",
