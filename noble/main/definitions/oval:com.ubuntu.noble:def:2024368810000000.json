		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected ones Userfaultfdunregister includes a step to remove wr-protect bits from all the relevantpgtable entries, but that only covered an explicit UFFDIO_UNREGISTER ioctl,not a close() on the userfaultfd itself. Cover that too. This fixes a WARNtrace. The only user visible side effect is the user can observe leftoverwr-protect bits even if the user close()ed on an userfaultfd when releasingthe last reference of it. However hopefully that should be harmless, andnothing bad should happen even if so. This change is now more importantafter the recent page-table-check patch we merged in mm-unstable(446dd9ad37d0 (\"mm/page_table_check: support userfault wr-protectentries\")), as we'll do sanity check on uffd-wp bits without vma context.So it's better if we can 100% guarantee no uffd-wp bit leftovers, to makesure each report will be valid.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36881` to fix the vulnerability.
