		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: hda: Fix UAF of leds class devs at unbindingThe LED class devices that are created by HD-audio codec drivers areregistered via devm_led_classdev_register() and associated with theHD-audio codec device.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the devresrelease doesn't work for this case; namely, since the codec resourcerelease happens before the devm call chain, it triggers a NULLdereference or a UAF for a stale set_brightness_delay callback.For fixing the bug, this patch changes the LED class device registerand unregister in a manual manner without devres, keeping theinstances in hda_gen_spec.",
