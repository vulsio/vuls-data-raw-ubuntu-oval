		"description": "`yt-dlp` is a command-line audio/video downloader. Prior to version2024.07.01, `yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files,which could lead to aribitrary filenames being created in the downloadfolder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads configfrom the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executedfrom the yt-dlp directory) this could lead to arbitrary code beingexecuted. `yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting theallowed extensions. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might notget downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitationsurface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the outputtemplate and make sure the user trusts the websites that they aredownloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory withinPATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, orother binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep thedefault output template (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure theextension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; tryto avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config--config-location ...` to not load config from common locations.",
