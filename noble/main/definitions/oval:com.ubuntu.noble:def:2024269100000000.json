		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operationThe patch \"netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroyand kernel side add/del/test\", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition.But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slowsit down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions asrcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectorswhich need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroyfunctions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely atexecuting the command received by netlink and moving the remainingpart only into the rcu callback.",
