		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tap: add missing verification for short frameThe cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame lengthin the tap_get_user_xdp() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to besent downstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, thetap_get_user_xdp()-->skb_set_network_header() may assume the size is morethan ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause out-of-boundaccess beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer with incorrector inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.In the alternative path, tap_get_user() already prohibits short frame whichhas the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted.This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just likehow tap_get_user() does.CVE: CVE-2024-41090",
