		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi:fix null pointer dereference within spi_sync If spi_sync() is called withthe non-empty queue and the same spi_message is then reused, the completecallback for the message remains set while the context is cleared, leadingto a null pointer dereference when the callback is invoked fromspi_finalize_current_message(). With function inlining disabled, the callstack might look like this: _raw_spin_lock_irqsave fromcomplete_with_flags+0x18/0x58 complete_with_flags from spi_complete+0x8/0xcspi_complete from spi_finalize_current_message+0xec/0x184spi_finalize_current_message from spi_transfer_one_message+0x2a8/0x474spi_transfer_one_message from __spi_pump_transfer_message+0x104/0x230__spi_pump_transfer_message from __spi_transfer_message_noqueue+0x30/0xc4__spi_transfer_message_noqueue from __spi_sync+0x204/0x248 __spi_sync fromspi_sync+0x24/0x3c spi_sync from mcp251xfd_regmap_crc_read+0x124/0x28c[mcp251xfd] mcp251xfd_regmap_crc_read [mcp251xfd] from_regmap_raw_read+0xf8/0x154 _regmap_raw_read from_regmap_bus_read+0x44/0x70 _regmap_bus_read from _regmap_read+0x60/0xd8_regmap_read from regmap_read+0x3c/0x5c regmap_read frommcp251xfd_alloc_can_err_skb+0x1c/0x54 [mcp251xfd]mcp251xfd_alloc_can_err_skb [mcp251xfd] from mcp251xfd_irq+0x194/0xe70[mcp251xfd] mcp251xfd_irq [mcp251xfd] from irq_thread_fn+0x1c/0x78irq_thread_fn from irq_thread+0x118/0x1f4 irq_thread from kthread+0xd8/0xf4kthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x28 Fix this by also settingmessage->complete to NULL when the transfer is complete.",
