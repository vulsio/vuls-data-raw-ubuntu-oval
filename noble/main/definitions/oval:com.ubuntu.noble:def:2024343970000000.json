		"description": "An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.78.5, and 2.79.x and 2.80.xbefore 2.80.1. When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals from atrusted system service such as NetworkManager on a shared computer, otherusers of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that theGDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by thetrusted system service. This could lead to the GDBus-based client behavingincorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-34397` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-girepository-3.0 - 2.80.0-6ubuntu3.1\ngir1.2-glib-2.0 - 2.80.0-6ubuntu3.1\nlibgirepository-2.0-0 - 2.80.0-6ubuntu3.1\nlibglib2.0-0t64 - 2.80.0-6ubuntu3.1\nlibglib2.0-bin - 2.80.0-6ubuntu3.1\nlibglib2.0-data - 2.80.0-6ubuntu3.1\nlibglib2.0-tests - 2.80.0-6ubuntu3.1\nNo subscription required",
