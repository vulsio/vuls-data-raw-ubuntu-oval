		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:maple_tree: fix mas_empty_area_rev() null pointer dereference Currently thecode calls mas_start() followed by mas_data_end() if the maple state isMA_START, but mas_start() may return with the maple state node == NULL.This will lead to a null pointer dereference when checking information inthe NULL node, which is done in mas_data_end(). Avoid setting the offset ifthere is no node by waiting until after the maple state is checked for anempty or single entry state. A user could trigger the events to cause akernel oops by unmapping all vmas to produce an empty maple tree, thenmapping a vma that would cause the scenario described above.",
