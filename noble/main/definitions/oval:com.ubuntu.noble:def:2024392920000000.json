		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: um: Addwinch to winch_handlers before registering winch IRQ Registering a winchIRQ is racy, an interrupt may occur before the winch is added to thewinch_handlers list. If that happens, register_winch_irq() adds to thatlist a winch that is scheduled to be (or has already been) freed, causing apanic later in winch_cleanup(). Avoid the race by adding the winch to thewinch_handlers list before registering the IRQ, and rolling back ifum_request_irq() fails.",
