		"description": "A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow anunauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to an incorrectcheck for end-of-string values during scanning, which may result in a heapbuffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability bysubmitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAVon an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker tocause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoScondition on the affected software and consuming available systemresources. For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog .\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-20290` to fix the vulnerability.
