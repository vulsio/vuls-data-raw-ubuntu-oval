		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath12k: fix kernel crash during resumeCurrently during resume, QMI target memory is not properly handled,resultingin kernel crash in case DMA remap is not supported:BUG: Bad page state in process kworker/u16:54  pfn:36e80page: refcount:1 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:0x36e80page dumped because: nonzero _refcountCall Trace: bad_page free_page_is_bad_report __free_pages_ok __free_pages dma_direct_free dma_free_attrs ath12k_qmi_free_target_mem_chunk ath12k_qmi_msg_mem_request_cbThe reason is:Once ath12k module is loaded, firmware sends memory request to host.

If suspend is triggered, firmware will be reloadedduring resume. As same as before, firmware requests two large segments atfirst. In ath12k_qmi_msg_mem_request_cb() segment count and size areassigned:\tab->qmi.mem_seg_count == 2\tab->qmi.target_mem[0].size == 7077888\tab->qmi.target_mem[1].size == 8454144Then allocation failed like before and ath12k_qmi_free_target_mem_chunk()is called to free all allocated segments. Note the first segment is skippedbecause its v.addr is cleared due to allocation failure:\tchunk->v.addr = dma_alloc_coherent()Also note that this leaks that segment because it has not been freed.While freeing the second segment, a size of 8454144 is passed todma_free_coherent(). However remember that this segment is allocated atthe first time firmware is loaded, before suspend. So its real size is524288, much smaller than 8454144. As a result kernel found we are freeingsome memory which is in use and thus cras---truncated---",
