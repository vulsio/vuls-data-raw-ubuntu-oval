		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder Not alldecoders have a reset callback. The CXL specification allows a host bridgewith a single root port to have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently theregion driver assumes there are none. As such the CXL core creates aspecial pass through decoder instance without a commit/reset callback.Prior to this patch, the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally whencalling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge, 1Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL type3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null pointerdereference. Before the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroythe region, and a pass through decoder is reset. The issue can bereproduced as below, 1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes aHB with a single root port under which a memdev is attached directly. 2)destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.",
