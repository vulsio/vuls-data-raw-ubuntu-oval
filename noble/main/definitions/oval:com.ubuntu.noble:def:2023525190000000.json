		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: HID:intel-ish-hid: ipc: Disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit The EHL (ElkhartLake) based platforms provide a OOB (Out of band) service, which allows towakup device when the system is in S5 (Soft-Off state). This OOB servicecan be enabled/disabled from BIOS settings. When enabled, the ISH devicegets PME wake capability. To enable PME wakeup, driver also needs to enableACPI GPE bit. On resume, BIOS will clear the wakeup bit. So driver need tore-enable it in resume function to keep the next wakeup capability. Butthis BIOS clearing of wakeup bit doesn't decrement internal OS GPEreference count, so this reenabling on every resume will cause referencecount to overflow. So first disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit usingacpi_disable_gpe().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52519` to fix the vulnerability.
