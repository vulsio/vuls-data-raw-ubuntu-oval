		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/fair: Prevent dead task groups from regaining cfs_rq's Kevin isreporting crashes which point to a use-after-free of a cfs_rq inupdate_blocked_averages(). Initial debugging revealed that we've livecfs_rq's (on_list=1) in an about to be kfree()'d task group infree_fair_sched_group(). However, it was unclear how that can happen. Hiskernel config happened to lead to a layout of struct sched_entity that putthe 'my_q' member directly into the middle of the object which makes itincidentally overlap with SLUB's freelist pointer. That, in combinationwith SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED's freelist pointer mangling, leads to areliable access violation in form of a #GP which made the UAF fail fast.Michal seems to have run into the same issue[1]. He already correctlydiagnosed that commit a7b359fc6a37 (\"sched/fair: Correctly insert cfs_rq'sto list on unthrottle\") is causing the preconditions for the UAF to happenby re-adding cfs_rq's also to task groups that have no more running tasks,i.e. also to dead ones. His analysis, however, misses the real root causeand it cannot be seen from the crash backtrace only, as the real offenderis tg_unthrottle_up() getting called via sched_cfs_period_timer() via thetimer interrupt at an inconvenient time. When unregister_fair_sched_group()unlinks all cfs_rq's from the dying task group, it doesn't protect itselffrom getting interrupted. If the timer interrupt triggers while we iterateover all CPUs or after unregister_fair_sched_group() has finished but priorto unlinking the task group, sched_cfs_period_timer() will execute and walkthe list of task groups, trying to unthrottle cfs_rq's, i.e. re-add them tothe dying task group. These will later -- in free_fair_sched_group() -- bekfree()'ed while still being linked, leading to the fireworks Kevin andMichal are seeing. To fix this race, ensure the dying task group getsunlinked first. However, simply switching the order of unregistering andunlinking the task group isn't sufficient, as concurrent RCU walkers mightstill see it, as can be seen below: CPU1: CPU2: : timer IRQ: :do_sched_cfs_period_timer(): : : : distribute_cfs_runtime(): :rcu_read_lock(); : : : unthrottle_cfs_rq(): sched_offline_group(): : :walk_tg_tree_from(…,tg_unthrottle_up,…): list_del_rcu(&tg->list); : (1) :list_for_each_entry_rcu(child, &parent->children, siblings) : : (2)list_del_rcu(&tg->siblings); : : tg_unthrottle_up():unregister_fair_sched_group(): struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq =tg->cfs_rq[cpu_of(rq)]; : : list_del_leaf_cfs_rq(tg->cfs_rq[cpu]); : : : :if (!cfs_rq_is_decayed(cfs_rq) || cfs_rq->nr_running) (3) :list_add_leaf_cfs_rq(cfs_rq); : : : : : : : : : ---truncated---\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47209` to fix the vulnerability.
