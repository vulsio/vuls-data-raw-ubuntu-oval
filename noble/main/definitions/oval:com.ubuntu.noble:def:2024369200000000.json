		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:mpi3mr: Avoid memcpy field-spanning write WARNING When the \"storcli2 show\"command is executed for eHBA-9600, mpi3mr driver prints this WARNINGmessage: memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 128) of single field\"bsg_reply_buf->reply_buf\" at drivers/scsi/mpi3mr/mpi3mr_app.c:1658 (size1) WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 12760 at drivers/scsi/mpi3mr/mpi3mr_app.c:1658mpi3mr_bsg_request+0x6b12/0x7f10 [mpi3mr] The cause of the WARN is 128bytes memcpy to the 1 byte size array \"__u8 replay_buf[1]\" in the structmpi3mr_bsg_in_reply_buf. The array is intended to be a flexible lengtharray, so the WARN is a false positive. To suppress the WARN, remove theconstant number '1' from the array declaration and clarify that it hasflexible length. Also, adjust the memory allocation size to match thechange.",
