		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: keep DMA buffers required for suspend/resume Nouveaudeallocates a few buffers post GPU init which are required for GPUsuspend/resume to function correctly. This is likely not as big an issue onsystems where the NVGPU is the only GPU, but on multi-GPU set ups it leadsto a regression where the kernel module errors and results in a system-widerendering freeze. This commit addresses that regression by moving the twobuffers required for suspend and resume to be deallocated at driver unloadinstead of post init.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27411` to fix the vulnerability.
