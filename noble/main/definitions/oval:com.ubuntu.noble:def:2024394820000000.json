		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bcache: fix variable length array abuse in btree_iterbtree_iter is used in two ways: either allocated on the stack with afixed size MAX_BSETS, or from a mempool with a dynamic size based on thespecific cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array ofsize MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sizediterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.This patch uses the same approach as in bcachefs's sort_iter and splitsthe iterator into a btree_iter with a flexible array member and abtree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a fixed-lengthdata array.",
