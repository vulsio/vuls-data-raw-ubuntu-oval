		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:atlantic: eliminate double free in error handling logic Driver has a logicleak in ring data allocation/free, where aq_ring_free could be calledmultiple times on same ring, if system is under stress and got memoryallocation error. Ring pointer was used as an indicator of failure, butthis is not correct since only ring data is allocated/deallocated. Ringitself is an array member. Changing ring allocation functions to returnerror code directly. This simplifies error handling and eliminatesaq_ring_free on higher layer.",
