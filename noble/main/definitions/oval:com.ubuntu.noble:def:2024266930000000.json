		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:iwlwifi: mvm: fix a crash when we run out of stations A DoS tool thatinjects loads of authentication frames made our AP crash. Theiwl_mvm_is_dup() function couldn't find the per-queue dup_data which wasnot allocated. The root cause for that is that we ran out of stations inthe firmware and we didn't really add the station to the firmware, yet wedidn't return an error to mac80211. Mac80211 was thinking that we have thestation and because of that, sta_info::uploaded was set to 1. This allowedieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() to return a valid station object, but thatieee80211_sta didn't have any iwl_mvm_sta object initialized and thatcaused the crash mentioned earlier when we got Rx on that station.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26693` to fix the vulnerability.
