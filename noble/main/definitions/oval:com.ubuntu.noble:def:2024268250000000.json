		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfc: nci: free rx_data_reassembly skb on NCI device cleanuprx_data_reassembly skb is stored during NCI data exchange for processingfragmented packets. It is dropped only when the last fragment is processedor when an NTF packet with NCI_OP_RF_DEACTIVATE_NTF opcode is received.However, the NCI device may be deallocated before that which leads to skbleak.As by design the rx_data_reassembly skb is bound to the NCI device andnothing prevents the device to be freed before the skb is processed insome way and cleaned, free it on the NCI device cleanup.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
