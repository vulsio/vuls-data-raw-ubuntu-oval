		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Avoid splat in pskb_pull_reasonsyzkaller builds (CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=y) frequently trigger a debughint in pskb_may_pull.We'd like to retain this debug check because it might hint at integeroverflows and other issues (kernel code should pull headers, not hugevalue).In bpf case, this splat isn't interesting at all: such (nonsensical)bpf programs are typically generated by a fuzzer anyway.Do what Eric suggested and suppress such warning.For CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=n we don't need the extra check becausepskb_may_pull will do the right thing: return an error without theWARN() backtrace.",
