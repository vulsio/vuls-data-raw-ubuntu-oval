		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: khugepaged: skip huge page collapse for special filesThe read-only THP for filesystems will collapse THP for files openedreadonly and mapped with VM_EXEC.  The intended usecase is to avoid TLBmisses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file typesso a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, blockdevice, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  Thismay cause bugs, like [1] and [2].This is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP forregular files in order to close the attack surface.[shy828301@gmail.com: fix vm_file check [3]]",
