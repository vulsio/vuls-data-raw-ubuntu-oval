		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: acpi: Harden get_cpu_for_acpi_id() against missing CPU entryIn a review discussion of the changes to support vCPU hotplug wherea check was added on the GICC being enabled if was online, it wasnoted that there is need to map back to the cpu and use that to indexinto a cpumask. As such, a valid ID is needed.If an MPIDR check fails in acpi_map_gic_cpu_interface() it is possiblefor the entry in cpu_madt_gicc[cpu] == NULL.  This function wouldthen cause a NULL pointer dereference.   Whilst a path to triggerthis has not been established, harden this caller against thepossibility.",
