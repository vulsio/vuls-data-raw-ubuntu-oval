		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/siw: Fix connection failure handling In case immediate MPA requestprocessing fails, the newly created endpoint unlinks the listening endpointand is ready to be dropped. This special case was not handled correctly bythe code handling the later TCP socket close, causing a NULL dereferencecrash in siw_cm_work_handler() when dereferencing a NULL listener. We nowalso cancel the useless MPA timeout, if immediate MPA request processingfails. This patch furthermore simplifies MPA processing in general:Scheduling a useless TCP socket read in sk_data_ready() upcall is nowsurpressed, if the socket is already moved out of TCP_ESTABLISHED state.",
