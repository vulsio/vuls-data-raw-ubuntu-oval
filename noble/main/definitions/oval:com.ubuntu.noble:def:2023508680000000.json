		"description": "The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial ofservice (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in arandom subdomain attack, aka the \"NSEC3\" issue. The RFC 5155 specificationimplies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hashfunction in certain situations.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-50868` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibunbound8 - 1.19.1-1ubuntu1\npython3-unbound - 1.19.1-1ubuntu1\nunbound - 1.19.1-1ubuntu1\nunbound-anchor - 1.19.1-1ubuntu1\nunbound-host - 1.19.1-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\ndnsmasq - 2.90-1\ndnsmasq-base - 2.90-1\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.90-1\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.90-1\nNo subscription required",
