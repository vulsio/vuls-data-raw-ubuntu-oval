		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Fix stackmap overflow check on 32-bit arches The stackmap code relies onroundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of hash buckets, and contains anoverflow check by checking if the resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bitarches, the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shiftof an unsigned long value, which is undefined behaviour, so it is notguaranteed to truncate neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on theDEVMAP_HASH type, which contains the same check, copied from the hashtabcode. The commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this, but thefix did not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where anoverflow does result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not guaranteed.Checking the value before rounding does not have this problem.",
