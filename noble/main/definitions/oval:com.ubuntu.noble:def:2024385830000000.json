		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread Patch series \"nilfs2: fixlog writer related issues\". This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 logwriter-related issues, including a timer use-after-free issue and potentialdeadlock issue on unmount, and a potential freeze issue in eventsynchronization found during their analysis. Details are described in eachcommit log. This patch (of 3): A use-after-free issue has been reportedregarding the timer sc_timer on the nilfs_sc_info structure. The problem isthat even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log writer thread,sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure is about to befreed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime. Fix this issue bylimiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer thread is alive.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38583` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-40-generic - 6.8.0-40.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-40-generic - 6.8.0-40.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-40-generic-64k - 6.8.0-40.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1013-aws - 6.8.0-1013.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1012-gcp - 6.8.0-1012.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-gke - 6.8.0-1008.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-ibm - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oracle - 6.8.0-1010.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-oem - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1009.16\nNo subscription required",
