		"description": "Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4,2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repositorythat contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks toarbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the targetrepository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over thefilesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the samefilesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. Whencloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the`file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloningwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object filesinstead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symboliclinks in the source repository, which were added during the fix forCVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard linkoperation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystemappears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during theoperation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and createhardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readablefiles. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4,2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-32021` to fix the vulnerability.
