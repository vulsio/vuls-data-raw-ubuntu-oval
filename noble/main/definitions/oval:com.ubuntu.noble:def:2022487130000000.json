		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range modeAdd a check for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in aplace where a missing check can cause a kernel crash.Fixes a bug introduced by commit 670638477aed (\"perf/x86/intel/pt:Opportunistically use single range output mode\"), which added asupport for PT single-range output mode. Since that commit if a PTstop filter range is hit while tracing, the kernel will crash becauseof a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due to callingpt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured.The commit which introduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses ofthe ToPA buffer variables with checks of the buf->single variable, butmissed the case where tracing was stopped by the PT hardware, whichhappens when execution hits a configured stop filter.Tested that hitting a stop filter while PT recording successfullyrecords a trace with this patch but crashes without this patch.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48713` to fix the vulnerability.
