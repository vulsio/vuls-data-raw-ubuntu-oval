		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/pseries: Fix scv instruction crash with kexeckexec on pseries disables AIL (reloc_on_exc), required for scvinstruction support, before other CPUs have been shut down. This meansthey can execute scv instructions after AIL is disabled, which causes aninterrupt at an unexpected entry location that crashes the kernel.Change the kexec sequence to disable AIL after other CPUs have beenbrought down.As a refresher, the real-mode scv interrupt vector is 0x17000, and thefixed-location head code probably couldn't easily deal with implementingsuch high addresses so it was just decided not to support that interruptat all.",
