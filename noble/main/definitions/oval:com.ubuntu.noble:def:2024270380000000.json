		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: clk:Fix clk_core_get NULL dereference It is possible for clk_core_get todereference a NULL in the following sequence: clk_core_get()of_clk_get_hw_from_clkspec() __of_clk_get_hw_from_provider() __clk_get_hw()__clk_get_hw() can return NULL which is dereferenced by clk_core_get() athw->core. Prior to commit dde4eff47c82 (\"clk: Look for parents with clkdevbased clk_lookups\") the check IS_ERR_OR_NULL() was performed which wouldhave caught the NULL. Reading the description of this function it talksabout returning NULL but that cannot be so at the moment. Update thefunction to check for hw before dereferencing it and return NULL if hw isNULL.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27038` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic-64k - 6.8.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1009-aws - 6.8.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-azure - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-gcp - 6.8.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1004-gke - 6.8.0-1004.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-ibm - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1005-raspi - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-oem - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required",
