		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nvme:host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse() Whennvme_identify_ns() fails, it frees the pointer to the struct nvme_id_nsbefore it returns. However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree() for the pointereven when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in KASAN double-free,which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with proposed patches [1] on thekernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by skipping kfree() whennvme_identify_ns() fails.",
