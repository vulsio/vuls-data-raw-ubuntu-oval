		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll()The use-after-free is actually in rswitch_tx_free(), which is inlined inrswitch_poll(). Since `skb` and `gq->skbs[gq->dirty]` are in fact thesame pointer, the skb is first freed using dev_kfree_skb_any(), then thevalue in skb->len is used to update the interface statistics.Let's move around the instructions to use skb->len before the skb isfreed.This bug is trivial to reproduce using KFENCE. It will trigger a splatevery few packets. A simple ARP request or ICMP echo request is enough.",
