		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: of:dynamic: Synchronize of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removals Inthe following sequence: 1) of_platform_depopulate() 2) of_overlay_remove()During the step 1, devices are destroyed and devlinks are removed. Duringthe step 2, OF nodes are destroyed but __of_changeset_entry_destroy() canraise warnings related to missing of_node_put(): ERROR: memory leak,expected refcount 1 instead of 2 ... Indeed, during the devlink removalsperformed at step 1, the removal itself releasing the device (and theattached of_node) is done by a job queued in a workqueue and so, it is doneasynchronously with respect to function calls. When the warning is present,of_node_put() will be called but wrongly too late from the workqueue job.In order to be sure that any ongoing devlink removals are done before theof_node destruction, synchronize the of_changeset_destroy() with thedevlink removals.",
