		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/msm/a6xx: Avoid a nullptr dereference when speedbin setting failsCalling a6xx_destroy() before adreno_gpu_init() leads to a null pointerdereference on: msm_gpu_cleanup() : platform_set_drvdata(gpu->pdev, NULL);as gpu->pdev is only assigned in: a6xx_gpu_init() |_ adreno_gpu_init |_msm_gpu_init() Instead of relying on handwavy null checks down the cleanupchain, explicitly de-allocate the LLC data and free a6xx_gpu instead.Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/588919/",
