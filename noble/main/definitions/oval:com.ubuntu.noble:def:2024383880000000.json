		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:hda/cs_dsp_ctl: Use private_free for control cleanup Use the controlprivate_free callback to free the associated data block. This ensures thatthe memory won't leak, whatever way the control gets destroyed. Theoriginal implementation didn't actually remove the ALSA controls inhda_cs_dsp_control_remove(). It only freed the internal tracking structure.This meant it was possible to remove/unload the amp driver while leavingits ALSA controls still present in the soundcard. Obviously attempting toaccess them could cause segfaults or at least dereferencing stale pointers.",
