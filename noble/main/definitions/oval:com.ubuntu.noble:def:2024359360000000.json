		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:handle chunk tree lookup error in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() The unhandledcase in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption, as it could becaused only by two impossible conditions: - at first the search key is setup to look for a chunk tree item, with offset -1, this is an inexact searchand the key->offset will contain the correct offset upon a successfulsearch, a valid chunk tree item cannot have an offset -1 - after firstsuccessful search, the found_key corresponds to a chunk item, the offset isdecremented by 1 before the next loop, it's impossible to find a chunk itemthere due to alignment and size constraints\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35936` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-38-generic - 6.8.0-38.38\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-generic - 6.8.0-38.38\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-generic-64k - 6.8.0-38.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-azure - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-gcp - 6.8.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-gke - 6.8.0-1006.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-ibm - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-lowlatency - 6.8.0-38.38.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-38.38.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1007-raspi - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-oem - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-intel - 6.8.0-1007.14\nNo subscription required",
