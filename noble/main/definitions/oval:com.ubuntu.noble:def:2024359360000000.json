		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: handle chunk tree lookup error in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks()The unhandled case in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption,as it could be caused only by two impossible conditions:- at first the search key is set up to look for a chunk tree item, with  offset -1, this is an inexact search and the key->offset will contain  the correct offset upon a successful search, a valid chunk tree item  cannot have an offset -1- after first successful search, the found_key corresponds to a chunk  item, the offset is decremented by 1 before the next loop, it's  impossible to find a chunk item there due to alignment and size  constraints",
