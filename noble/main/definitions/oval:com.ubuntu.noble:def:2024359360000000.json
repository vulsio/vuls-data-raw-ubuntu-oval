		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:handle chunk tree lookup error in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() The unhandledcase in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption, as it could becaused only by two impossible conditions: - at first the search key is setup to look for a chunk tree item, with offset -1, this is an inexact searchand the key->offset will contain the correct offset upon a successfulsearch, a valid chunk tree item cannot have an offset -1 - after firstsuccessful search, the found_key corresponds to a chunk item, the offset isdecremented by 1 before the next loop, it's impossible to find a chunk itemthere due to alignment and size constraints",
