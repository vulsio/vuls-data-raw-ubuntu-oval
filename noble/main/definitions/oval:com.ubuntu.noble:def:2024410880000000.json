		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:can: mcp251xfd: fix infinite loop when xmit failsWhen the mcp251xfd_start_xmit() function fails, the driver stopsprocessing messages, and the interrupt routine does not return,running indefinitely even after killing the running application.Error messages:[  441.298819] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: ERROR in mcp251xfd_start_xmit: -16[  441.306498] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: Transmit Event FIFO buffer not empty.(seq=0x000017c7, tef_tail=0x000017cf, tef_head=0x000017d0,tx_head=0x000017d3).... and repeat forever.The issue can be triggered when multiple devices share the same SPIinterface. And there is concurrent access to the bus.The problem occurs because tx_ring->head increments even ifmcp251xfd_start_xmit() fails. Consequently, the driver skips one TXpackage while still expecting a response inmcp251xfd_handle_tefif_one().Resolve the issue by starting a workqueue to write the tx objsynchronously if err = -EBUSY. In case of another error, decrementtx_ring->head, remove skb from the echo stack, and drop the message.[mkl: use more imperative wording in patch description]",
