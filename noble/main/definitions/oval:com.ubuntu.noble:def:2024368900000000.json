		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointers Currently, if anautomatically freed allocation is an error pointer that will lead to acrash. An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show(). 171 char *label__free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i); 172 if (IS_ERR(label)) {173 dev_err(wm831x->dev, \"Failed to duplicate label\\n\"); 174 continue; 175} The auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well,otherwise we're going to keep hitting issues like this.",
