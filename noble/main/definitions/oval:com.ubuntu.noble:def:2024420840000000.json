		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ftruncate: pass a signed offsetThe old ftruncate() syscall, using the 32-bit off_t misses a signextension when called in compat mode on 64-bit architectures.  As aresult, passing a negative length accidentally succeeds in truncatingto file size between 2GiB and 4GiB.Changing the type of the compat syscall to the signed compat_off_tchanges the behavior so it instead returns -EINVAL.The native entry point, the truncate() syscall and the correspondingloff_t based variants are all correct already and do not sufferfrom this mistake.",
