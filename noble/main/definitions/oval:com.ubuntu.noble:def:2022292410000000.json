		"description": "Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and RESTendpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter Notebook. Prior toversion 1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir`that contains the starting user's home directory, then the underlying RESTAPI can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time byguessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requiresan authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-sitescripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leakthis access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used alongwith the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such asmodifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or.ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentiallysensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issueis patched in version 1.17.1.",
