		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: phy: fix phy_get_internal_delay accessing an empty arrayThe phy_get_internal_delay function could try to access to an emptyarray in the case that the driver is calling phy_get_internal_delaywithout defining delay_values and rx-internal-delay-ps ortx-internal-delay-ps is defined to 0 in the device-tree.This will lead to \"unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference atvirtual address 0\". To avoid this kernel oops, the test should be delay>= 0. As there is already delay < 0 test just before, the test couldonly be size == 0.",
