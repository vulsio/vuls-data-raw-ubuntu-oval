		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ext4:fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super Buffer head references must be releasedbefore calling kill_bdev(); otherwise the buffer head (and its pagereferenced by b_data) will not be freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently thatbh will be leaked. If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will killcurrent buffers and page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super blockwill be reread again but using correct blocksize this time.sb_set_blocksize() didn't fully free superblock page and buffer head, andbeing busy, they were not freed and instead leaked. This can easily bereproduced by calling an infinite loop of: systemctl start<ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount ... sincesystemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and the bh leakget amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never gets freed, andmemory consumption is much more easily noticed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47119` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic-64k - 6.5.0-9.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-gcp - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-oracle - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1005-raspi - 6.5.0-1005.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1005.12\nNo subscription required",
