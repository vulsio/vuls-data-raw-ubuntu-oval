		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: phy:lynx-28g: serialize concurrent phy_set_mode_ext() calls to shared registersThe protocol converter configuration registers PCC8, PCCC, PCCD(implemented by the driver), as well as others, control protocol convertersfrom multiple lanes (each represented as a different struct phy). So, ifthere are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext() to lanes sharing thesame PCC register (either for the \"old\" or for the \"new\" protocol),corruption of the values programmed to hardware is possible, becauselynx_28g_rmw() has no locking. Add a spinlock in the struct lynx_28g_privshared by all lanes, and take the global spinlock from the phy_ops ::set_mode() implementation. There are no other callers which modify PCCregisters.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52505` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.6.0-14-generic - 6.6.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-generic - 6.6.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-generic-64k - 6.6.0-14.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-aws - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-azure - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-gcp - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-ibm - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-lowlatency - 6.6.0-14.14.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-lowlatency-64k - 6.6.0-14.14.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-oracle - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.7.0-1001-raspi - 6.7.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1001.6\nNo subscription required",
