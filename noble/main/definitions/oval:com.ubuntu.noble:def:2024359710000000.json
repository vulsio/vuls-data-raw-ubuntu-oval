		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:ks8851: Handle softirqs at the end of IRQ thread to fix hang Theks8851_irq() thread may call ks8851_rx_pkts() in case there are any packetsin the MAC FIFO, which calls netif_rx(). This netif_rx() implementation isguarded by local_bh_disable() and local_bh_enable(). The local_bh_enable()may call do_softirq() to run softirqs in case any are pending. One of thesoftirqs is net_rx_action, which ultimately reaches the driver .start_xmitcallback. If that happens, the system hangs. The entire call chain isbelow: ks8851_start_xmit_par from netdev_start_xmit netdev_start_xmit fromdev_hard_start_xmit dev_hard_start_xmit from sch_direct_xmitsch_direct_xmit from __dev_queue_xmit __dev_queue_xmit from __neigh_update__neigh_update from neigh_update neigh_update from arp_process.constprop.0arp_process.constprop.0 from __netif_receive_skb_one_core__netif_receive_skb_one_core from process_backlog process_backlog from__napi_poll.constprop.0 __napi_poll.constprop.0 from net_rx_actionnet_rx_action from __do_softirq __do_softirq from call_with_stackcall_with_stack from do_softirq do_softirq from __local_bh_enable_ip__local_bh_enable_ip from netif_rx netif_rx from ks8851_irq ks8851_irq fromirq_thread_fn irq_thread_fn from irq_thread irq_thread from kthread kthreadfrom ret_from_fork The hang happens because ks8851_irq() first locks aspinlock in ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spin_lock_irqsave(&ksp->lock,...) and with that spinlock locked, calls netif_rx(). Once the executionreaches ks8851_start_xmit_par(), it calls ks8851_lock_par() again whichattempts to claim the already locked spinlock again, and the hang happens.Move the do_softirq() call outside of the spinlock protected section ofks8851_irq() by disabling BHs around the entire spinlock protected sectionof ks8851_irq() handler. Place local_bh_enable() outside of the spinlockprotected section, so that it can trigger do_softirq() without theks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spinlock being held, and safely callks8851_start_xmit_par() without attempting to lock the already lockedspinlock. Since ks8851_irq() is protected bylocal_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() now, replace netif_rx() with__netif_rx() which is not duplicating thelocal_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() calls.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35971` to fix the vulnerability.
