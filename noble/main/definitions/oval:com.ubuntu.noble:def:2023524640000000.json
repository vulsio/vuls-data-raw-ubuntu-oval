		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:EDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access Enabling-Wstringop-overflow globally exposes a warning for a common bug in theusage of strncat(): drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c: In function'thunderx_ocx_com_threaded_isr': drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c:1136:17:error: 'strncat' specified bound 1024 equals destination size[-Werror=stringop-overflow=] 1136 | strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);| ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ... 1145 | strncat(msg, other,OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE); ... 1150 | strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE); ...Apparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the waythat strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer as itsthird argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The result isthat there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer. Change it tostrlcat(). [ bp: Trim compiler output, fixup commit message. ]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52464` to fix the vulnerability.
