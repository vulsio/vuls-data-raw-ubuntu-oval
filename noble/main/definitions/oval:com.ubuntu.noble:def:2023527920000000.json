		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/region: Do not try to cleanup after cxl_region_setup_targets() failsCommit 5e42bcbc3fef (\"cxl/region: decrement ->nr_targets on error incxl_region_attach()\") tried to avoid 'eiw' initialization errors when->nr_targets exceeded 16, by just decrementing ->nr_targets whencxl_region_setup_targets() failed. Commit 86987c766276 (\"cxl/region:Cleanup target list on attach error\") extended that cleanup to also clearcxled->pos and p->targets[pos]. The initialization error was incidentallyfixed separately by: Commit 8d4285425714 (\"cxl/region: Fix port setupuninitialized variable warnings\") which was merged a few days after5e42bcbc3fef. But now the original cleanup when cxl_region_setup_targets()fails prevents endpoint and switch decoder resources from being reused: 1)the cleanup does not set the decoder's region to NULL, which results infuture dpa_size_store() calls returning -EBUSY 2) the decoder is notproperly freed, which results in future commit errors associated with theupstream switch Now that the initialization errors were fixed separately,the proper cleanup for this case is to just return immediately. Then theresources associated with this target get cleanup up as normal when thefailed region is deleted. The ->nr_targets decrement in the error case alsohelped prevent a p->targets[] array overflow, so add a new check to preventagainst that overflow. Tested by trying to create an invalid region for a 2switch * 2 endpoint topology, and then following up with creating a validregion.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52792` to fix the vulnerability.
