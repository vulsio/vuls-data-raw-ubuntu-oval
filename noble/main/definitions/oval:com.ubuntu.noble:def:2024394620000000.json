		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: bcm: dvp: Assign ->num before accessing ->hwsCommit f316cdff8d67 (\"clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with__counted_by\") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the numberof elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out ofbounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must beinitialized with the number of elements before the first array accesshappens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to theinitialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs inclk_dvp_probe() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has beenaccessed:  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds indrivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2711-dvp.c:59:2  index 0 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)'(aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, whichclears up the warning.",
