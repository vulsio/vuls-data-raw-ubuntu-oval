		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvme-fabrics: use reserved tag for reg read/write commandIn some scenarios, if too many commands are issued by nvme command inthe same time by user tasks, this may exhaust all tags of admin_q. Ifa reset (nvme reset or IO timeout) occurs before these commands finish,reconnect routine may fail to update nvme regs due to insufficient tags,which will cause kernel hang forever. In order to workaround this issue,maybe we can let reg_read32()/reg_read64()/reg_write32() use reservedtags. This maybe safe for nvmf:1. For the disable ctrl path,  we will not issue connect command2. For the enable ctrl / fw activate path, since connect and reg_xx()   are called serially.So the reserved tags may still be enough while reg_xx() use reserved tags.",
