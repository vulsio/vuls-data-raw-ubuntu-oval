		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tick/broadcast: Move per CPU pointer access into the atomic sectionThe recent fix for making the take over of the broadcast timer morereliable retrieves a per CPU pointer in preemptible context.This went unnoticed as compilers hoist the access into the non-preemptibleregion where the pointer is actually used. But of course it's valid thatthe compiler keeps it at the place where the code puts it which rightfullytriggers:  BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code:       caller is hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull+0x1c/0xc0Move it to the actual usage site which is in a non-preemptible region.",
