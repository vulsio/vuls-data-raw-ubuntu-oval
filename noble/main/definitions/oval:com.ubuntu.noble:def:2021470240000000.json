We partially solvedthis issue with commit ac03046ece2b (\"vsock/virtio: free packets during thesocket release\"), but we forgot to drain the RX queue when the socket isdefinitely closed by the scheduled work. To avoid future issues, let's usethe new virtio_transport_remove_sock() to drain the RX queue beforeremoving the socket from the af_vsock lists calling vsock_remove_sock().[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=24452624fc4c571eedd9",
