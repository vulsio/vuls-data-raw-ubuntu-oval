		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assemblingWhen CXL subsystem is auto-assembling a pmem region during cxlendpoint port probing, always hit below calltrace.

Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe.The endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause apmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust thesequence so this dependency is met.This requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() thatcan be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is notyet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, sostart the query from there instead.",
