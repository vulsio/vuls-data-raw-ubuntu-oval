		"title": "CVE-2024-36971 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - high",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:fix __dst_negative_advice() race __dst_negative_advice() does not enforceproper RCU rules when sk->dst_cache must be cleared, leading to possibleUAF. RCU rules are that we must first clear sk->sk_dst_cache, then calldst_release(old_dst). Note that sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing thisprotocol correctly, while __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.Given that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic against RTF_CACHE, thismeans each of the three ->negative_advice() existing methods must performthe sk_dst_reset() themselves. Note the check against NULL dst iscentralized in __dst_negative_advice(), there is no need to duplicate it invarious callbacks. Many thanks to Clement Lecigne for tracking this issue.This old bug became visible after the blamed commit, using UDP sockets.",
