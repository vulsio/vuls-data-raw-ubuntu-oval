		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amdkfd: don't allow mapping the MMIO HDP page with large pagesWe don't get the right offset in that case.  The GPU hasan unused 4K area of the register BAR space into which you canremap registers.  We remap the HDP flush registers into thisspace to allow userspace (CPU or GPU) to flush the HDP when itupdates VRAM.  However, on systems with >4K pages, we end upexposing PAGE_SIZE of MMIO space.",
