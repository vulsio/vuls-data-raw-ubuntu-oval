		"title": "CVE-2024-35808 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly Currentlymd_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directly withoutholding 'reconfig_mutex', this is definitely unsafe becausemd_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by'reconfig_mutex'. However, hold 'reconfig_mutex' here is still problematicbecause this will cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b (\"md:refactor idle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock\"). Fix this problem byusing stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread, like md/raid did.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35808` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic-64k - 6.8.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1009-aws - 6.8.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-gcp - 6.8.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-ibm - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1005-raspi - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-oem - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required",
