		"description": "A PV guest could DoS Xen while unmapping a grant To address XSA-380,reference counting was introduced for grant mappings for the case where aPV guest would have the IOMMU enabled. PV guests can request two forms ofmappings. When both are in use for any individual mapping, unmapping ofsuch a mapping can be requested in two steps. The reference count for sucha mapping would then mistakenly be decremented twice. Underflow of thecounters gets detected, resulting in the triggering of a hypervisor bugcheck.",
