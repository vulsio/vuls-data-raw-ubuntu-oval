Using two sources forthe information is the root cause. In this function before the fix bumpingv didn't mean bumping vf pointer. But the code used this variablesinterchangeably, so stale vf could point to different/not intended vf.Remove redundant \"v\" variable and iterate via single VF pointer acrosswhole function instead to guarantee VF pointer validity.",
