		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: idxd: Convert spinlock to mutex to lock evl workqueuedrain_workqueue() cannot be called safely in a spinlocked context due topossible task rescheduling. In the multi-task scenario, callingqueue_work() while drain_workqueue() will lead to a Call Trace as pushing awork on a draining workqueue is not permitted in spinlocked context. CallTrace: <TASK> ? __warn+0x7d/0x140 ? __queue_work+0x2b2/0x440 ?report_bug+0x1f8/0x200 ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70 ?asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 ? __queue_work+0x2b2/0x440queue_work_on+0x28/0x30 idxd_misc_thread+0x303/0x5a0 [idxd] ?__schedule+0x369/0xb40 ? __pfx_irq_thread_fn+0x10/0x10 ?irq_thread+0xbc/0x1b0 irq_thread_fn+0x21/0x70 irq_thread+0x102/0x1b0 ?preempt_count_add+0x74/0xa0 ? __pfx_irq_thread_dtor+0x10/0x10 ?__pfx_irq_thread+0x10/0x10 kthread+0x103/0x140 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 </TASK> The current implementation uses aspinlock to protect event log workqueue and will lead to the Call Trace dueto potential task rescheduling. To address the locking issue, convert thespinlock to mutex, allowing the drain_workqueue() to be called in a safemutex-locked context. This change ensures proper synchronization whenaccessing the event log workqueue, preventing potential Call Trace andimproving the overall robustness of the code.",
