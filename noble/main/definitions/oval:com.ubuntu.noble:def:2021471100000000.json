		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/kvm: Disable kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdown Currenly, we disablekvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook and this only happens for boot CPU.We need to disable it for all CPUs to guard against memory corruption e.g.on restore from hibernate. Note, writing '0' to kvmclock MSR doesn't clearmemory location, it just prevents hypervisor from updating the location sofor the short while after write and while CPU is still alive, the clockremains usable and correct so we don't need to switch to some otherclocksource.",
