		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_maskThe problem is that there are systems where cpu_possible_mask has gapsbetween set CPUs, for example SPARC.  In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa()hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and notsetup CPU area using per_cpu() macro.  This results in an oops on SPARC.A per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectlyassuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps.  Fix it by adjusting an indexto a next possible CPU.",
