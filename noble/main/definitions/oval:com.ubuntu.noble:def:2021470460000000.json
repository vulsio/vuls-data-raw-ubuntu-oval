		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction() Thehdcp_i2c_offsets[] array did not have an entry forHDCP_MESSAGE_ID_WRITE_CONTENT_STREAM_TYPE so it led to an off by one readoverflow. I added an entry and copied the 0x0 value for the offset fromsimilar code in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c. I alsodeclared several of these arrays as having HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_MAX entries.This doesn't change the code, but it's just a belt and suspenders approachto try future proof the code.",
