		"description": "By design, the DHCP protocol does not authenticate messages, including forexample the classless static route option (121). An attacker with theability to send DHCP messages can manipulate routes to redirect VPNtraffic, allowing the attacker to read, disrupt, or possibly modify networktraffic that was expected to be protected by the VPN. Many, if not most VPNsystems based on IP routing are susceptible to such attacks.",
