		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix possible null pointer derefence with invalid contextsvmw_context_cotable can return either an error or a null pointer and itsusage sometimes went unchecked. Subsequent code would then try to accesseither a null pointer or an error value. The invalid dereferences were onlypossible with malformed userspace apps which never properly initialized therendering contexts. Check the results of vmw_context_cotable to fix theinvalid derefs. Thanks: ziming zhang(@ezrak1e) from Ant Group Light-YearSecurity Lab who was the first person to discover it. Niels De Graef whoreported it and helped to track down the poc.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26979` to fix the vulnerability.
