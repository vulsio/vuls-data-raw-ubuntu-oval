		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix data corruption in dsync block recovery for small block sizes Thehelper function nilfs_recovery_copy_block() ofnilfs_recovery_dsync_blocks(), which recovers data from logs created bydata sync writes during a mount after an unclean shutdown, incorrectlycalculates the on-page offset when copying repair data to the file's pagecache. In environments where the block size is smaller than the page size,this flaw can cause data corruption and leak uninitialized memory bytesduring the recovery process. Fix these issues by correcting this byteoffset calculation on the page.",
