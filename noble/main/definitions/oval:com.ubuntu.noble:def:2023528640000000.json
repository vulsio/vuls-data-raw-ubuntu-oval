		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char deviceSince commit fa1f68db6ca7 (\"drivers: misc: pass miscdevice pointer viafile private data\"), the miscdevice stores a pointer to itself insidefilp->private_data, which means that private_data will not be NULL whenwmi_char_open() is called. This might cause memory corruption shouldwmi_char_open() be unable to find its driver, something which canhappen when the associated WMI device is deleted in wmi_free_devices().Fix the problem by using the miscdevice pointer to retrieve the WMIdevice data associated with a char device using container_of(). Thisalso avoids wmi_char_open() picking a wrong WMI device bound to adriver with the same name as the original driver.",
