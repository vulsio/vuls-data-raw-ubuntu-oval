		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers/perf: hisi_pcie: Fix out-of-bound access when valid event group Theperf tool allows users to create event groups through following cmd [1],but the driver does not check whether the array index is out of bounds whenwriting data to the event_group array. If the number of events in anevent_group is greater than HISI_PCIE_MAX_COUNTERS, the memory writeoverflow of event_group array occurs. Add array index check to fix thepossible array out of bounds violation, and return directly when write newevents are written to array bounds. There are 9 different events in anevent_group. [1] perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}'",
