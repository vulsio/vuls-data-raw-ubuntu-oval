The buffer objects in vmw_plane_stateinstead of using the builtin map_and_cache were trying to handlethe lifetime of the mapped memory themselves, leading to crashes.Use the map_and_cache instead of trying to manage the lifetime of thebuffer objects held by the vmw_plane_state.Fixes kernel oops'es in IGT's kms_cursor_legacy forked-bo.",
