		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix the lifetime of the bo cursor memory The cleanup can bedispatched while the atomic update is still active, which means that thememory acquired in the atomic update needs to not be invalidated by thecleanup. The buffer objects in vmw_plane_state instead of using the builtinmap_and_cache were trying to handle the lifetime of the mapped memorythemselves, leading to crashes. Use the map_and_cache instead of trying tomanage the lifetime of the buffer objects held by the vmw_plane_state.Fixes kernel oops'es in IGT's kms_cursor_legacy forked-bo.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35810` to fix the vulnerability.
