		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iio:mma8452: Fix trigger reference couting The mma8452 driver directly assignsa trigger to the struct iio_dev. The IIO core when done using this triggerwill call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop the reference count by 1. Without thematching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference count can reach 0too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a use-after-freeoccurs. Fix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning itto the IIO device.",
