		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: ensure offloading TID queue existsThe resume code path assumes that the TX queue for the offloading TIDhas been configured. At resume time it then tries to sync the writepointer as it may have been updated by the firmware.In the unusual event that no packets have been send on TID 0, the queuewill not have been allocated and this causes a crash. Fix this byensuring the queue exist at suspend time.",
