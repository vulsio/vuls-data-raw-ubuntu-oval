		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mptcp: pm: fix ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations'local_addr_used' and 'add_addr_accepted' are decremented for addressesnot related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source anddestination addresses of the initial subflows are known from thebeginning: they don't count as \"additional local address being used\" or\"ADD_ADDR being accepted\".It is then required not to increment them when the entrypoint used bythe initial subflow is removed and re-added during a connection. Withoutthis modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added morethan once.",
