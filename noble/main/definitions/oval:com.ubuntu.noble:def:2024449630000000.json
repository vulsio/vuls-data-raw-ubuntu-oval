		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: do not BUG_ON() when freeing tree block after errorWhen freeing a tree block, at btrfs_free_tree_block(), if we fail tocreate a delayed reference we don't deal with the error and just do aBUG_ON(). The error most likely to happen is -ENOMEM, and we have acomment mentioning that only -ENOMEM can happen, but that is not true,because in case qgroups are enabled any error returned frombtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_post() (can be -EUCLEAN or anything returnedfrom btrfs_search_slot() for example) can be propagated back tobtrfs_free_tree_block().So stop doing a BUG_ON() and return the error to the callers and makethem abort the transaction to prevent leaking space. Syzbot wastriggering this, likely due to memory allocation failure injection.",
