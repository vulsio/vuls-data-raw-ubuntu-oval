		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interface imon driverprobes two USB interfaces, and at the probe of the second interface, thedriver assumes blindly that the first interface got bound with the sameimon driver. It's usually true, but it's still possible that the firstinterface is bound with another driver via a malformed descriptor. Then itmay lead to a memory corruption, as spotted by syzkaller; imon driveraccesses the data from drvdata as struct imon_context object although it'sa completely different one that was assigned by another driver. This patchadds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is really bound with theimon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem above at the probe time.",
