		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slab_common: fix slab_caches list corruption after kmem_cache_destroy()After the commit in Fixes:, if a module that created a slab cache does notrelease all of its allocated objects before destroying the cache (at rmmodtime), we might end up releasing the kmem_cache object without removing itfrom the slab_caches list thus corrupting the list as kmem_cache_destroy()ignores the return value from shutdown_cache(), which in turn never removesthe kmem_cache object from slabs_list in case __kmem_cache_shutdown() failsto release all of the cache's slabs. This is easily observable on a kernelbuilt with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y as after that ill release the system willimmediately trip on list_add, or list_del, assertions similar to the oneshown below as soon as another kmem_cache gets created, or destroyed: [1041.213632] list_del corruption. next->prev should be ffff89f596fb5768,but was 52f1e5016aeee75d.
