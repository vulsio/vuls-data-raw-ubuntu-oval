		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs:remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item Instead ofcalling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item into thedelayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources we haveallocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is finebecause all existing call chains undo anything they have done beforecalling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pendingsnapshots in the transaction commit path). So remove the BUG() call and doproper error handling. This relates to a syzbot report linked below, butdoes not fix it because it only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fixthe issue where somehow we attempt to use twice the same index number fordifferent index items.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52569` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.6.0-14-generic - 6.6.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-generic - 6.6.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-generic-64k - 6.6.0-14.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-aws - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-azure - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-gcp - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-ibm - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-lowlatency - 6.6.0-14.14.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-14-lowlatency-64k - 6.6.0-14.14.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.6.0-1001-oracle - 6.6.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.7.0-1001-raspi - 6.7.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
