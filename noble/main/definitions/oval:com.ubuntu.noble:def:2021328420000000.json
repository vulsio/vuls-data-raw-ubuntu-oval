		"description": "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Startingversion 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if thedestination file is under a destination directory. However, it is notenforced that `_baseDirectory` ends with slash. If the _baseDirectory isnot slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a filewith a name thats begins as the destination directory one level up from thedirectory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name anddestination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact islimited and depends on the use case. Version 1.3.3 fixed thisvulnerability.",
