		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls:fix missing memory barrier in tls_init In tls_init(), a write memorybarrier is missing, and store-store reordering may cause NULL dereferencein tls_{setsockopt,getsockopt}. CPU0 CPU1 ----- ----- // In tls_init() //In tls_ctx_create() ctx = kzalloc() ctx->sk_proto = READ_ONCE(sk->sk_prot)-(1) // In update_sk_prot() WRITE_ONCE(sk->sk_prot, tls_prots) -(2) // Insock_common_setsockopt() READ_ONCE(sk->sk_prot)->setsockopt() // Intls_{setsockopt,getsockopt}() ctx->sk_proto->setsockopt() -(3) In the abovescenario, when (1) and (2) are reordered, (3) can observe the NULL value ofctx->sk_proto, causing NULL dereference. To fix it, we rely onrcu_assign_pointer() which implies the release barrier semantic. By movingrcu_assign_pointer() after ctx->sk_proto is initialized, we can ensure thatctx->sk_proto are visible when changing sk->sk_prot.",
