		"title": "CVE-2022-31090 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requestsare sensitive information. In affected versions when using our Curlhandler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an`Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirectto a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or port), if wechoose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option beforecontinuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to thenew request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soonas possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle shouldupgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implementedin Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of thecurl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not coverchange in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expectredirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend,rather than curl.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-31090` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphp-guzzlehttp-guzzle - 7.4.5-1\nNo subscription required\n\nmediawiki - 1:1.35.7-1\nmediawiki-classes - 1:1.35.7-1\nNo subscription required",
