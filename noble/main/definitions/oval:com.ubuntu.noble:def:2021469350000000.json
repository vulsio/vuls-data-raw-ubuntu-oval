		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder:fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels In 4.13, commit74310e06be4d (\"android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with userspace\") fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads sothe driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronoustransactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.Unfortunately, on the \"free\" side, the accounting of async_free_space didnot add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes ofasync_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or less.These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue has goneundetected for several years. The fix is to use \"buffer_size\" (theallocated buffer size) instead of \"size\" (the logical buffer size) whenupdating the async_free_space during the free operation. These are the sameexcept for this corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8bytes.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46935` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic-64k - 6.5.0-9.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-gcp - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-oracle - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1005-raspi - 6.5.0-1005.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required",
