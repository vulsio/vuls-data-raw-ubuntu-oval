		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf: Fix event leak upon exitWhen a task is scheduled out, pending sigtrap deliveries are deferredto the target task upon resume to userspace via task_work.However failures while adding an event's callback to the task_workengine are ignored. And since the last call for events exit happenafter task work is eventually closed, there is a small window duringwhich pending sigtrap can be queued though ignored, leaking the eventrefcount addition such as in the following scenario:    TASK A    -----    do_exit()       exit_task_work(tsk);       <IRQ>       perf_event_overflow()          event->pending_sigtrap = pending_id;          irq_work_queue(&event->pending_irq);       </IRQ>    =========> PREEMPTION: TASK A -> TASK B       event_sched_out()          event->pending_sigtrap = 0;          atomic_long_inc_not_zero(&event->refcount)          // FAILS: task work has exited          task_work_add(&event->pending_task)       [...]       <IRQ WORK>       perf_pending_irq()          // early return: event->oncpu = -1       </IRQ WORK>       [...]    =========> TASK B -> TASK A       perf_event_exit_task(tsk)          perf_event_exit_event()             free_event()                WARN(atomic_long_cmpxchg(&event->refcount, 1, 0) != 1)                // leak event due to unexpected refcount == 2As a result the event is never released while the task exits.Fix this with appropriate task_work_add()'s error handling.",
