		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_work Whenthe ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crashes withnull pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove functiontries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using cancel_delayed_work_syncroutine and unregister switch from dsa. During dsa_unregister_switch itcalls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn reschedules the workqueue sincemib_interval is non-zero. Due to which queue executed after mib_intervaland it tries to access dp->slave. But the slave is unregistered in theksz_switch_remove function. Hence kernel crashes. To avoid this crash,before canceling the workqueue, resetted the mib_interval to 0. v1 -> v2:-Removed the if condition in ksz_mib_read_work",
