		"description": "Mishandling of guest SSBD selection on AMD hardware The current logic toset SSBD on AMD Family 17h and Hygon Family 18h processors requires thatthe setting of SSBD is coordinated at a core level, as the setting isshared between threads. Logic was introduced to keep track of how manythreads require SSBD active in order to coordinate it, such logic relies onusing a per-core counter of threads that have SSBD active. When running onthe mentioned hardware, it's possible for a guest to under or overflow thethread counter, because each write to VIRT_SPEC_CTRL.SSBD by the guest getspropagated to the helper that does the per-core active accounting.Underflowing the counter causes the value to get saturated, and thusattempts for guests running on the same core to set SSBD won't have effectbecause the hypervisor assumes it's already active.",
