		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblitThis issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctlFBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo structcontaining only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixelwith values.If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, thevc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads tothe updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value tofbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return awrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causesthe imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be calledeven if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will\"fix and fill\" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.",
