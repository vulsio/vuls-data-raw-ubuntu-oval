		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:kdb: Fix buffer overflow during tab-completeCurrently, when the user attempts symbol completion with the Tab key, kdbwill use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer.Unfortunately it passes the size of the source buffer rather than thedestination to strncpy() with predictably horrible results. Most obviouslyif the command buffer is already full but cp, the cursor position, is inthe middle of the buffer, then we will write past the end of the suppliedbuffer.Fix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy()calls plus explicit boundary checks to make sure we have enough spacebefore we start moving characters around.",
