But the connectorstill refers to it, so this cleanup leaves behind a stale pointerin struct drm_connector.ddc.Bind the lifetime of the I2C adapter to the connector's lifetime byusing DRM's managed release. When the DRM device goes away (afterthe Linux device) DRM will first clean up the connector and thenclean up the I2C adapter.",
