		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:qat - validate slices count returned by FW The functionadf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL) feature on a QATdevice by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message to the firmware. Thistriggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMA buffer in memory andreturns an array containing the number of accelerators of each type(slices) supported by this HW. The pointer to this array is stored in theadf_tl_hw_data data structure called slice_cnt. The array slice_cnt is thenused in the function tl_print_dev_data() to report in debugfs onlystatistics about the supported accelerators. An incorrect value of theelements in slice_cnt might lead to an out of bounds memory read. At themoment, there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrong value, butfor robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.",
