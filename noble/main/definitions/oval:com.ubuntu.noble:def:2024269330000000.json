		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: USB:core: Fix deadlock in port \"disable\" sysfs attribute The show and storecallback routines for the \"disable\" sysfs attribute file in port.c acquirethe device lock for the port's parent hub device. This can cause problemsif another process has locked the hub to remove it or change itsconfiguration: Removing the hub or changing its configuration requires thehub interface to be removed, which requires the port device to be removed,and device_del() waits until all outstanding sysfs attribute callbacks forthe ports have returned. The lock can't be released until then. But thedisable_show() or disable_store() routine can't return until after it hasacquired the lock. The resulting deadlock can be avoided by callingsysfs_break_active_protection(). This will cause the sysfs core not to waitfor the attribute's callback routine to return, allowing the removal toproceed. The disadvantage is that after making this call, there is noguarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated at any moment. Toprevent this, we have to acquire a reference to it first by callinghub_get().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26933` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic-64k - 6.8.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1009-aws - 6.8.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-gcp - 6.8.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-ibm - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1005-raspi - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-oem - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required",
