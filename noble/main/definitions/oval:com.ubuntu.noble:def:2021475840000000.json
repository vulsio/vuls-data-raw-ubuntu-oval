		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iocost:Fix divide-by-zero on donation from low hweight cgroup The donationcalculation logic assumes that the donor has non-zero after-donationhweight, so the lowest active hweight a donating cgroup can have is 2 sothat it can donate 1 while keeping the other 1 for itself. Earlier, we onlydonated from cgroups with sizable surpluses so this condition was alwaystrue. However, with the precise donation algorithm implemented,f1de2439ec43 (\"blk-iocost: revamp donation amount determination\") made thedonation amount calculation exact enabling even low hweight cgroups todonate. This means that in rare occasions, a cgroup with active hweight of1 can enter donation calculation triggering the following warning and thena divide-by-zero oops.
