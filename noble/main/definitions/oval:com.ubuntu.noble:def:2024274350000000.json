		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nvme:fix reconnection fail due to reserved tag allocation We found a issue onproduction environment while using NVMe over RDMA, admin_q reconnect failedforever while remote target and network is ok. After dig into it, we foundit may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tag allocation. In my case, the tagwas hold by a keep alive request waiting inside admin_q, as we quiescedadmin_q while reset ctrl, so the request maked as idle and will not processbefore reset success. As fabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, whilereconnect remote target, we need a tag for connect command, but the onlyone reserved tag was held by keep alive command which waiting insideadmin_q. As a result, we failed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order tofix this issue, I think we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27435` to fix the vulnerability.
