		"description": "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework forrapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &clients. Netty prior to version 4.1.71.Final skips control chars when theyare present at the beginning / end of the header name. It should insteadfail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could lead to HTTPrequest smuggling. Failing to do the validation might cause netty to\"sanitize\" header names before it forward these to another remote systemwhen used as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage anymore,and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users should upgrade toversion 4.1.71.Final.",
