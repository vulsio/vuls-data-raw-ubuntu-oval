		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder:check offset alignment in binder_get_object() Commit 6d98eb95b450 (\"binder:avoid potential data leakage when copying txn\") introduced changes to howbinder objects are copied. In doing so, it unintentionally removed anoffset alignment check done through calls tobinder_alloc_copy_from_buffer() -> check_buffer(). These calls werereplaced in binder_get_object() with copy_from_user(), so now an explicitoffset alignment check is needed here. This avoids later complications whenunwinding the objects gets harder. It is worth noting this check existedprior to commit 7a67a39320df (\"binder: add function to copy binder objectfrom buffer\"), likely removed due to redundancy at the time.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26926` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-38-generic - 6.8.0-38.38\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-generic - 6.8.0-38.38\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-generic-64k - 6.8.0-38.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-azure - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-gcp - 6.8.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-gke - 6.8.0-1006.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-ibm - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-lowlatency - 6.8.0-38.38.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-38.38.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1007-raspi - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-oem - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-intel - 6.8.0-1007.14\nNo subscription required",
