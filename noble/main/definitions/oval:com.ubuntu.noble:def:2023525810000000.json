		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak when more than 255 elements expired Whenmore than 255 elements expired we're supposed to switch to a new gccontainer structure. This never happens: u8 type will wrap before reachingthe boundary and nft_trans_gc_space() always returns true. This means werecycle the initial gc container structure and lose track of the elementsthat came before. While at it, don't deref 'gc' after we've passed it tocall_rcu.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52581` to fix the vulnerability.
