		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc3: st: fix probed platform device ref count on probe error pathThe probe function never performs any paltform device allocation, thuserror path \"undo_platform_dev_alloc\" is entirely bogus.  It drops thereference count from the platform device being probed.  If error path istriggered, this will lead to unbalanced device reference counts andpremature release of device resources, thus possible use-after-free whenreleasing remaining devm-managed resources.",
