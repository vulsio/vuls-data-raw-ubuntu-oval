		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dpll: fix dpll_xa_ref_*_del() for multiple registrationsCurrently, if there are multiple registrations of the same pin on thesame dpll device, following warnings are observed:WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 2212 at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:143dpll_xa_ref_pin_del.isra.0+0x21e/0x230WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 2212 at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:223__dpll_pin_unregister+0x2b3/0x2c0The problem is, that in both dpll_xa_ref_dpll_del() anddpll_xa_ref_pin_del() registration is only removed from list in case thereference count drops to zero. That is wrong, the registration has tobe removed always.To fix this, remove the registration from the list and freeit unconditionally, instead of doing it only when the ref referencecounter reaches zero.",
