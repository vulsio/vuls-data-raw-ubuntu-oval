		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dpll:fix dpll_xa_ref_*_del() for multiple registrations Currently, if there aremultiple registrations of the same pin on the same dpll device, followingwarnings are observed: WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 2212 atdrivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:143 dpll_xa_ref_pin_del.isra.0+0x21e/0x230WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 2212 at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:223__dpll_pin_unregister+0x2b3/0x2c0 The problem is, that in bothdpll_xa_ref_dpll_del() and dpll_xa_ref_pin_del() registration is onlyremoved from list in case the reference count drops to zero. That is wrong,the registration has to be removed always. To fix this, remove theregistration from the list and free it unconditionally, instead of doing itonly when the ref reference counter reaches zero.",
