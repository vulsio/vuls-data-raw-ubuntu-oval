		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ax25:fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer When the ax25 device isdetaching, the ax25_dev_device_down() calls ax25_ds_del_timer() to cleanupthe slave_timer. When the timer handler is running, the ax25_ds_del_timer()that calls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result, theuse-after-free bugs could happen, one of the scenarios is shown below:(Thread 1) | (Thread 2) | ax25_ds_timeout() ax25_dev_device_down() |ax25_ds_del_timer() | del_timer() | ax25_dev_put() //FREE | | ax25_dev->//USE In order to mitigate bugs, when the device is detaching, usetimer_shutdown_sync() to stop the timer.",
