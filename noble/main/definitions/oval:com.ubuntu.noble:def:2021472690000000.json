		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb:dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception There is no validation of the indexfrom dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we might be referring a non-existing ep andtrigger a NULL pointer exception. In certain configurations we might usefewer eps and the index might wrongly indicate a larger ep index thanexisting. By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report awrong index back to the caller. In our usecase we are using a compositedevice on an older kernel, but upstream might use this fix also.Unfortunately, I cannot describe the hardware for others to reproduce theissue as it is a proprietary implementation.
