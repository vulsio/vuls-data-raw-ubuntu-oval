		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: PCI/PM:Drain runtime-idle callbacks before driver removal A race condition betweenthe .runtime_idle() callback and the .remove() callback in the rtsx_pcr PCIdriver leads to a kernel crash due to an unhandled page fault [1]. Theproblem is that rtsx_pci_runtime_idle() is not expected to be running afterpm_runtime_get_sync() has been called, but the latter doesn't reallyguarantee that. It only guarantees that the suspend and resume callbackswill not be running when it returns. However, if a .runtime_idle() callbackis already running when pm_runtime_get_sync() is called, the latter willnotice that the runtime PM status of the device is RPM_ACTIVE and it willreturn right away without waiting for the former to complete. In fact, itcannot wait for .runtime_idle() to complete because it may be called fromthat callback (it arguably does not make much sense to do that, but it isnot strictly prohibited). Thus in general, whoever is providing a.runtime_idle() callback needs to protect it from running in parallel withwhatever code runs after pm_runtime_get_sync(). [Note that .runtime_idle()will not start after pm_runtime_get_sync() has returned, but it maycontinue running then if it has started earlier.] One way to address thatrace condition is to call pm_runtime_barrier() after pm_runtime_get_sync()(not before it, because a nonzero value of the runtime PM usage counter isnecessary to prevent runtime PM callbacks from being invoked) to wait forthe .runtime_idle() callback to complete should it be running at thatpoint. A suitable place for doing that is in pci_device_remove() whichcalls pm_runtime_get_sync() before removing the driver, so it may as wellcall pm_runtime_barrier() subsequently, which will prevent the race inquestion from occurring, not just in the rtsx_pcr driver, but in any PCIdrivers providing .runtime_idle() callbacks.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35809` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic - 6.8.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-generic-64k - 6.8.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1009-aws - 6.8.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-gcp - 6.8.0-1008.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-ibm - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-35-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-35.35.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1005-raspi - 6.8.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1006-oem - 6.8.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required",
