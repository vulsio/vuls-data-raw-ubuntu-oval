		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Allow delete from sockmap/sockhash only if update is allowed We have seenan influx of syzkaller reports where a BPF program attached to a tracepointtriggers a locking rule violation by performing a map_delete on asockmap/sockhash. We don't intend to support this artificial use scenario.Extend the existing verifier allowed-program-type check for updatingsockmap/sockhash to also cover deleting from a map. From now on only BPFprograms which were previously allowed to update sockmap/sockhash candelete from these map types.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38662` to fix the vulnerability.
