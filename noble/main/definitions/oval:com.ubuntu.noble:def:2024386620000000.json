		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Allow delete from sockmap/sockhash only if update is allowedWe have seen an influx of syzkaller reports where a BPF program attached toa tracepoint triggers a locking rule violation by performing a map_deleteon a sockmap/sockhash.We don't intend to support this artificial use scenario. Extend theexisting verifier allowed-program-type check for updating sockmap/sockhashto also cover deleting from a map.From now on only BPF programs which were previously allowed to updatesockmap/sockhash can delete from these map types.",
