		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON Consider thefollowing sequence of events: 1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which endsup calling into shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account theblocks, we shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. Wereturn -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated. 2. Our callerdetects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after dropping themmap_lock, and retries, calling back into shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). 3.Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used. 4. Soshmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and immediatelyreturns - without releasing the page. This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller,which asserts that the page should always be consumed, unless -ENOENT isreturned. To fix this, detect if we have such a \"dangling\" page whenaccounting fails, and if so, release it before returning.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46988` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic - 6.5.0-9.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-generic-64k - 6.5.0-9.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-gcp - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-oracle - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1005-raspi - 6.5.0-1005.7\nNo subscription required",
