		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaks Nouveau manages GSP-RM DMAbuffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects. Several of these buffers are neverdealloced. Some of them can be deallocated right after GSP-RM isinitialized, but the rest need to stay until the driver unloads. Alsofuther bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and clearing thenvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated. Poisoning the buffer shouldtrigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries to access the bufferafter we've deallocated it, because we were wrong about when it is safe todeallocate. Finally, change the mem->size field to a size_t because that'sthe same type that dma_alloc_coherent expects.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26912` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-gcp - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-oracle - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required",
