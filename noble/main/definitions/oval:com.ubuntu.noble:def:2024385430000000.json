		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:lib/test_hmm.c: handle src_pfns and dst_pfns allocation failure Thekcalloc() in dmirror_device_evict_chunk() will return null if the physicalmemory has run out. As a result, if src_pfns or dst_pfns is dereferenced,the null pointer dereference bug will happen. Moreover, the device is goingaway. If the kcalloc() fails, the pages mapping a chunk could not beevicted. So add a __GFP_NOFAIL flag in kcalloc(). Finally, as there is noneed to have physically contiguous memory, Switch kcalloc() to kvcalloc()in order to avoid failing allocations.",
