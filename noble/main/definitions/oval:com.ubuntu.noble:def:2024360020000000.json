		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dpll:fix dpll_pin_on_pin_register() for multiple parent pins In scenario wherepin is registered with multiple parent pins viadpll_pin_on_pin_register(..), all belonging to the same dpll device. Asecond call to dpll_pin_on_pin_unregister(..) would cause a call trace, asit tries to use already released registration resources (due to fixintroduced in b446631f355e). In this scenario pin was registered twice, soresources are not yet expected to be release until each registered pin/pinpair is unregistered. Currently, the following crash/call trace is producedwhen ice driver is removed on the system with installed E810T NIC whichincludes dpll device: WARNING: CPU: 51 PID: 9155 atdrivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:809 dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30 RIP:0010:dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30 Call Trace: ? __warn+0x7f/0x130 ?dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30 dpll_msg_add_pin_freq+0x37/0x1d0dpll_cmd_pin_get_one+0x1c0/0x400 ? __nlmsg_put+0x63/0x80dpll_pin_event_send+0x93/0x140 dpll_pin_on_pin_unregister+0x3f/0x100ice_dpll_deinit_pins+0xa1/0x230 [ice] ice_remove+0xf1/0x210 [ice] Fix byadding a parent pointer as a cookie when creating a registration, also whensearching for it. For the regular pins pass NULL, this allows to createseparated registration for each parent the pin is registered with.",
