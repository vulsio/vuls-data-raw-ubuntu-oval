		"description": "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js. Prior toversion 5.26.2, Undici already cleared Authorization headers oncross-origin redirects, but did not clear `Cookie` headers. By design,`cookie` headers are forbidden request headers, disallowing them to be setin RequestInit.headers in browser environments. Since undici handlesheaders more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from theassumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch. As suchthis may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party site or amalicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an openredirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site. This was patched inversion 5.26.2. There are no known workarounds.",
