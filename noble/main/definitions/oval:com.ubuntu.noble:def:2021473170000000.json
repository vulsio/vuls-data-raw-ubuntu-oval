		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/bpf: Fix detecting BPF atomic instructions Commit 91c960b0056672(\"bpf: Rename BPF_XADD and prepare to encode other atomics in .imm\")converted BPF_XADD to BPF_ATOMIC and added a way to distinguishinstructions based on the immediate field. Existing JIT implementationswere updated to check for the immediate field and to reject programsutilizing anything more than BPF_ADD (such as BPF_FETCH) in the immediatefield. However, the check added to powerpc64 JIT did not look at thecorrect BPF instruction. Due to this, such programs would be accepted andincorrectly JIT'ed resulting in soft lockups, as seen with the atomicbounds test. Fix this by looking at the correct immediate value.",
