		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation failsWhen the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(),h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h->htablepointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, sincethe policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failedhashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely calledon it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a validempty hashtab when the allocation fails.",
