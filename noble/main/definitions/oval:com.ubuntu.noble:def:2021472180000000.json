		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails Whenthe hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(), h->size isleft initialized with a non-zero value, but the h->htable pointer is NULL.This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since the policydb coderelies on the assumption that even after a failed hashtab_init(),hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called on it. Yet, thesedetect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size. Fix this by makingsure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid empty hashtab whenthe allocation fails.",
