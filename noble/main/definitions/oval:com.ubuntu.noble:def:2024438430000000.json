		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv, bpf: Fix out-of-bounds issue when preparing trampoline imageWe get the size of the trampoline image during the dry run phase andallocate memory based on that size. The allocated image will then bepopulated with instructions during the real patch phase. But aftercommit 26ef208c209a (\"bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size\"), the `im`argument is inconsistent in the dry run and real patch phase. This maycause emit_imm in RV64 to generate a different number of instructionswhen generating the 'im' address, potentially causing out-of-boundsissues. Let's emit the maximum number of instructions for the \"im\"address during dry run to fix this problem.",
