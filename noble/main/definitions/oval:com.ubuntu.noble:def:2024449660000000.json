		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binfmt_flat: Fix corruption when not offsetting data startCommit 04d82a6d0881 (\"binfmt_flat: allow not offsetting data start\")introduced a RISC-V specific variant of the FLAT format which doesnot allocate any space for the (obsolete) array of shared librarypointers. However, it did not disable the code which initializes thearray, resulting in the corruption of sizeof(long) bytes before the DATAsegment, generally the end of the TEXT segment.Introduce MAX_SHARED_LIBS_UPDATE which depends on the state ofCONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET to guard the initialization ofthe shared library pointer region so that it will only be initializedif space is reserved for it.",
