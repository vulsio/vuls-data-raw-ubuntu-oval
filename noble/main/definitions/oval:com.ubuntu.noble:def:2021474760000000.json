		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: comedi:ni_usb6501: fix NULL-deref in command paths The driver uses endpoint-sizedUSB transfer buffers but had no sanity checks on the sizes. This can leadto zero-size-pointer dereferences or overflowed transfer buffers inni6501_port_command() and ni6501_counter_command() if a (malicious) devicehas smaller max-packet sizes than expected (or when doing descriptor fuzztesting). Add the missing sanity checks to probe().",
