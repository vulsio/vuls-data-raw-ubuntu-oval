		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:udf: Avoid using corrupted block bitmap bufferWhen the filesystem block bitmap is corrupted, we detect the corruptionwhile loading the bitmap and fail the allocation with error. However thenext allocation from the same bitmap will notice the bitmap buffer isalready loaded and tries to allocate from the bitmap with mixed results(depending on the exact nature of the bitmap corruption). Fix theproblem by using BH_verified bit to indicate whether the bitmap is validor not.",
