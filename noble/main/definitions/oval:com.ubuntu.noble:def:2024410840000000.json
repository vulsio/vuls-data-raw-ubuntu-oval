		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookupcxl_dpa_to_region() looks up a region based on a memdev and DPA.It wrongly assumes an endpoint found mapping the DPA is also ofa fully assembled region. When not true it leads to a null pointerdereference looking up the region name.This appears during testing of region lookup after a failure toassemble a BIOS defined region or if the lookup raced with theassembly of the BIOS defined region.Failure to clean up BIOS defined regions that fail assembly is anissue in itself and a fix to that problem will alleviate some ofthe impact. It will not alleviate the race condition so let's hardenthis path.The behavior change is that the kernel oops due to a null pointerdereference is replaced with a dev_dbg() message noting that anendpoint was mapped.Additional comments are added so that future users of this functioncan more clearly understand what it provides.",
