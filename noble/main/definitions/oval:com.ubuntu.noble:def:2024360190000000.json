		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:regmap: maple: Fix cache corruption in regcache_maple_drop()When keeping the upper end of a cache block entry, the entry[] arraymust be indexed by the offset from the base register of the block,i.e. max - mas.index.The code was indexing entry[] by only the register address, leadingto an out-of-bounds access that copied some part of the kernelmemory over the cache contents.This bug was not detected by the regmap KUnit test because it onlytests with a block of registers starting at 0, so mas.index == 0.",
