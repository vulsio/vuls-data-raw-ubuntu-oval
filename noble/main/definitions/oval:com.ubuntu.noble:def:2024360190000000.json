		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: regmap:maple: Fix cache corruption in regcache_maple_drop() When keeping the upperend of a cache block entry, the entry[] array must be indexed by the offsetfrom the base register of the block, i.e. max - mas.index. The code wasindexing entry[] by only the register address, leading to an out-of-boundsaccess that copied some part of the kernel memory over the cache contents.This bug was not detected by the regmap KUnit test because it only testswith a block of registers starting at 0, so mas.index == 0.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36019` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-38-generic - 6.8.0-38.38\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-generic - 6.8.0-38.38\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-generic-64k - 6.8.0-38.38\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-azure - 6.8.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1010-gcp - 6.8.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-ibm - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-lowlatency - 6.8.0-38.38.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-38-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-38.38.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-1007-raspi - 6.8.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-oem - 6.8.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1007-intel - 6.8.0-1007.14\nNo subscription required",
