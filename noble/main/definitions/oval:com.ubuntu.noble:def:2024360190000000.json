		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: regmap:maple: Fix cache corruption in regcache_maple_drop() When keeping the upperend of a cache block entry, the entry[] array must be indexed by the offsetfrom the base register of the block, i.e. max - mas.index. The code wasindexing entry[] by only the register address, leading to an out-of-boundsaccess that copied some part of the kernel memory over the cache contents.This bug was not detected by the regmap KUnit test because it only testswith a block of registers starting at 0, so mas.index == 0.",
