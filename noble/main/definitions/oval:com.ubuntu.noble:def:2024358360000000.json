		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dpll:fix pin dump crash for rebound module When a kernel module is unbound butthe pin resources were not entirely freed (other kernel module instance ofthe same PCI device have had kept the reference to that pin), and kernelmodule is again bound, the pin properties would not be updated (theproperties are only assigned when memory for the pin is allocated), proppointer still points to the kernel module memory of the kernel module whichwas deallocated on the unbind. If the pin dump is invoked in this state,the result is a kernel crash. Prevent the crash by storing persistent pinproperties in dpll subsystem, copy the content from the kernel module whenpin is allocated, instead of using memory of the kernel module.",
