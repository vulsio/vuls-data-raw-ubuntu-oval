		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix potential hang in nilfs_detach_log_writer() Syzbot has reported apotential hang in nilfs_detach_log_writer() called during nilfs2 unmount.Analysis revealed that this is because nilfs_segctor_sync(), whichsynchronizes with the log writer thread, can be called afternilfs_segctor_destroy() terminates that thread, as shown in the call tracebelow: nilfs_detach_log_writer nilfs_segctor_destroynilfs_segctor_kill_thread --> Shut down log writer thread flush_worknilfs_iput_work_func nilfs_dispose_list iput nilfs_evict_inodenilfs_transaction_commit nilfs_construct_segment (if inode needs sync)nilfs_segctor_sync --> Attempt to synchronize with log writer thread ***DEADLOCK *** Fix this issue by changing nilfs_segctor_sync() so that thelog writer thread returns normally without synchronizing after itterminates, and by forcing tasks that are already waiting to complete onceafter the thread terminates. The skipped inode metadata flushout will thenbe processed together in the subsequent cleanup work innilfs_segctor_destroy().",
