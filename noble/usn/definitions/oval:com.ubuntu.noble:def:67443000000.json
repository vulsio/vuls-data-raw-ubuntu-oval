		"description": "USN-6744-1 fixed a vulnerability in Pillow. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.  Original advisory details:   Hugo van Kemenade discovered that Pillow was not properly performing   bounds checks when processing an ICC file, which could lead to a buffer  overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a   specially crafted ICC file, an attacker could possibly use this issue   to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6744-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-pil-doc - 10.2.0-1ubuntu1 python3-pil - 10.2.0-1ubuntu1 python3-pil.imagetk - 10.2.0-1ubuntu1 No subscription required",
