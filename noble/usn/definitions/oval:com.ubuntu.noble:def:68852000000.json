		"description": "USN-6885-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Apache HTTP Server. One of the security fixes introduced a regression when proxying requests to a HTTP/2 server. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Marc Stern discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled  serving WebSocket protocol upgrades over HTTP/2 connections. A remote  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the server to crash,  resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2024-36387)    Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module  incorrectly sent certain request URLs with incorrect encodings to backends.  A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass authentication.  (CVE-2024-38473)    Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod_rewrite module  incorrectly handled certain substitutions. A remote attacker could possibly  use this issue to execute scripts in directories not directly reachable  by any URL, or cause a denial of service. Some environments may require  using the new UnsafeAllow3F flag to handle unsafe substitutions.  (CVE-2024-38474, CVE-2024-38475, CVE-2024-39573)    Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled  certain response headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue  to obtain sensitive information, execute local scripts, or perform SSRF  attacks. (CVE-2024-38476)    Orange Tsai discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module  incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.  (CVE-2024-38477)    It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled certain  handlers configured via AddType. A remote attacker could possibly use this  issue to obtain source code. (CVE-2024-39884)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6885-2` to fix the vulnerability.
