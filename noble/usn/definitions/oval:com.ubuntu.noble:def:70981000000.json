		"description": "Andy Boothe discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK 17 did not properly handle access under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-21208)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 17 did not properly handle vectorization under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to access unauthorized resources and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-21210, CVE-2024-21235)  It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK 17 did not properly handle deserialization under certain circumstances. An  unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial  of service. (CVE-2024-21217)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 17 was not properly performing bounds when handling certain UTF-8 strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
