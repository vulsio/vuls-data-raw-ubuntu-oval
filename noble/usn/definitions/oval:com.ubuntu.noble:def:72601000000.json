		"description": "It was discovered that OpenRefine did not properly handle opening tar files. If a user or application were tricked into opening a crafted tar file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-37476)  It was discovered that OpenRefine incorrectly handled file permissions and user authentication. An unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to leak sensitive information or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-41886, CVE-2023-41887)  It was discovered that OpenRefine did not properly disallow database settings to be modified when queried. An attacker could possibly use this issue to leak sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-23833)  It was discovered that OpenRefine did not properly sanitize the GET parameter for authorized commands, leading to a cross site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-47878)  It was discovered that OpenRefine did not properly prevent cross-site request forgery when running the preview-expression command. If a user or application were tricked into opening a specially crafted webpage, an attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-47879)  It was discovered that OpenRefine did not properly handle HTTP headers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-47880)  It was discovered that OpenRefine incorrectly handled database extensions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-47881)  It was discovered that OpenRefine did not properly escape HTML tags in exception messages, which could enable code injection. If a user or application were tricked into opening a malicious file, an attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-47882)  It was discovered that OpenRefine did not correctly handle paths when executing the load-language command. An attacker could possibly use this issue to leak sensitive information. (CVE-2024-49760)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7260-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openrefine - 3.7.7-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
