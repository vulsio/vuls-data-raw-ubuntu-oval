		"description": "It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 21 was not properly performing bounds when handling certain UTF-8 strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-21131)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 21 could be made to run into an infinite loop. If an automated system were tricked into processing excessively large symbols, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-21138)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 21 did not  properly perform range check elimination. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2024-21140)  Sergey Bylokhov discovered that OpenJDK 21 did not properly manage memory when handling 2D images. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2024-21145)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 21 incorrectly handled memory when performing range check elimination under certain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2024-21147)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6932-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-21-demo - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-doc - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-jdk - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-jdk-headless - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-jre - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-jre-headless - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-jre-zero - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-source - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 openjdk-21-testsupport - 21.0.4+7-1ubuntu2~24.04 No subscription required",
