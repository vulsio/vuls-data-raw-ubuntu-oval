		"description": "Yair Zak discovered that Docker could unexpectedly forward DNS requests  from internal networks in an unexpected manner. An attacker could possibly use this issue to exfiltrate data by encoding information in DNS queries  to controlled nameservers. This issue was only addressed in  Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-29018)  Cory Snider discovered that Docker did not properly handle authorization  plugin request processing. An attacker could possibly use this issue to  bypass authorization controls by forwarding API requests without their  full body, leading to unauthorized actions. (CVE-2024-41110)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-7161-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  docker-doc - 26.1.3-0ubuntu1~24.04.1+esm1 docker.io - 26.1.3-0ubuntu1~24.04.1+esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
