		"description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Theload-language command expects a `lang` parameter from which it constructsthe path of the localization file to load, of the form`translations-$LANG.json`. But when doing so in versions prior to 3.8.3, itdoes not check that the resulting path is in the expected directory, whichmeans that this command could be exploited to read other JSON files on thefile system. Version 3.8.3 addresses this issue.",
