		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadataWhen uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata, a newdst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb.This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specificskb.The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of1, which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. Whentun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from asingle place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will neverdrop to 0 (when the skb is consumed), leading to a memory leak.Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as thedst+metadata refcount is already 1.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48809` to fix the vulnerability.
