		"title": "CVE-2024-12254 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()method would not \"pause\" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain thebuffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the \"high-water mark\".Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write bufferpotentially leading to memory exhaustion. This vulnerability likelyimpacts a small number of users, you must be using Python 3.12.0 orlater, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module with protocols, andusing .writelines() method which had new zero-copy-on-write behavior inPython 3.12.0 and later. If not all of these factors are true then yourusage of Python is unaffected.",
