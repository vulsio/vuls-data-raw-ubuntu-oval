		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migrationEven on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive \"Bad page state\"s (often onflags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had beenset and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s fromdeferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARNsymptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 (\"mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when largefolio migration\") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in85ce2c517ade (\"memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration\"),but missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its ownlocal list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which timefolio->_deferred_list is not empty, but even the \"right\" lock does nothingto secure the folio and the list it is on.Fortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): sofolio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()while the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - addingsuch a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock andunmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezingwas needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42234` to fix the vulnerability.
