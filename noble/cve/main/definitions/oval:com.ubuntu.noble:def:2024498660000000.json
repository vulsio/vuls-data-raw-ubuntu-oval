		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing/timerlat: Fix a race during cpuhp processingThere is another found exception that the \"timerlat/1\" thread wasscheduled on CPU0, and lead to timer corruption finally:```ODEBUG: init active (active state 0) object: ffff888237c2e108 object type:hrtimer hint: timerlat_irq+0x0/0x220WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 426 at lib/debugobjects.c:518debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0Modules linked in:CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 426 Comm: timerlat/1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7+ #45Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS1.13.0-1ubuntu1.1 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0...Call Trace: <TASK> ? __warn+0x7c/0x110 ? debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0 ? report_bug+0xf1/0x1d0 ? prb_read_valid+0x17/0x20 ? handle_bug+0x3f/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x13/0x60 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20 ? debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0 ? debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0 ? __pfx_timerlat_irq+0x10/0x10 __debug_object_init+0x110/0x150 hrtimer_init+0x1d/0x60 timerlat_main+0xab/0x2d0 ? __pfx_timerlat_main+0x10/0x10 kthread+0xb7/0xe0 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x40 ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 </TASK>```After tracing the scheduling event, it was discovered that the migrationof the \"timerlat/1\" thread was performed during thread creation. Furtheranalysis confirmed that it is because the CPU online processing forosnoise is implemented through workers, which is asynchronous with theoffline processing. When the worker was scheduled to create a thread, theCPU may has already been removed from the cpu_online_mask during theofflineprocess, resulting in the inability to select the right CPU:T1                       | T2[CPUHP_ONLINE]           | cpu_device_down()osnoise_hotplug_workfn() |                         |     cpus_write_lock()                         |     takedown_cpu(1)                         |     cpus_write_unlock()[CPUHP_OFFLINE]          |    cpus_read_lock()     |    start_kthread(1)     |    cpus_read_unlock()   |To fix this, skip online processing if the CPU is already offline.",
