		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix null deref on system suspend entryWhen system enters suspend with an active stream, SOF corecalls hw_params_upon_resume(). On Intel platforms with HDA DMA usedto manage the link DMA, this leads to call chain of   hda_dsp_set_hw_params_upon_resume() -> hda_dsp_dais_suspend() -> hda_dai_suspend() -> hda_ipc4_post_trigger()A bug is hit in hda_dai_suspend() as hda_link_dma_cleanup() is run first,which clears hext_stream->link_substream, and then hda_ipc4_post_trigger()is called with a NULL snd_pcm_substream pointer.",
