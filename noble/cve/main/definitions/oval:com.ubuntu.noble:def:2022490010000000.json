		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: fix race when vmap stack overflowCurrently, when detecting vmap stack overflow, riscv firstly switchesto the so called shadow stack, then use this shadow stack to call theget_overflow_stack() to get the overflow stack. However, there'sa race here if two or more harts use the same shadow stack at the sametime.To solve this race, we introduce spin_shadow_stack atomic var, whichwill be swap between its own address and 0 in atomic way, when thevar is set, it means the shadow_stack is being used; when the varis cleared, it means the shadow_stack isn't being used.[Palmer: Add AQ to the swap, and also some comments.]",
