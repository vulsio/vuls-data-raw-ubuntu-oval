		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flipIt's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL inmtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip(). pending_needs_vblank value is set bymtk_crtc->event, but in mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded bythe same lock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.Consider the following case: CPU1 CPU2 step 1: mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin()mtk_crtc->event is not null, step 1: mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:mtk_drm_crtc_update_config( !!mtk_crtc->event) step 2: mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->mtk_drm_finish_page_flip: lock mtk_crtc->event set to null,pending_needs_vblank set to false unlock pending_needs_vblank set to true,step 2: mtk_crtc_ddp_irq -> mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,pending_needs_vblank is still true //null pointer Instead of guarding theentire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's more efficient to just check ifmtk_crtc->event is null before use.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26874` to fix the vulnerability.
