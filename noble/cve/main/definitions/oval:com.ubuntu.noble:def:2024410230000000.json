		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/deadline: Fix task_struct reference leakDuring the execution of the following stress test with linux-rt:stress-ng --cyclic 30 --timeout 30 --minimize --quietkmemleak frequently reported a memory leak concerning the task_struct:unreferenced object 0xffff8881305b8000 (size 16136):  comm \"stress-ng\", pid 614, jiffies 4294883961 (age 286.412s)  object hex dump (first 32 bytes):    02 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  .@..............    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................  debug hex dump (first 16 bytes):    53 09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  S...............  backtrace:    [<00000000046b6790>] dup_task_struct+0x30/0x540    [<00000000c5ca0f0b>] copy_process+0x3d9/0x50e0    [<00000000ced59777>] kernel_clone+0xb0/0x770    [<00000000a50befdc>] __do_sys_clone+0xb6/0xf0    [<000000001dbf2008>] do_syscall_64+0x5d/0xf0    [<00000000552900ff>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76The issue occurs in start_dl_timer(), which increments the task_structreference count and sets a timer. The timer callback, dl_task_timer,is supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,if enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,the reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.This patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_structreference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41023` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic-64k - 6.8.0-48.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1018-aws - 6.8.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-azure - 6.8.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-gcp - 6.8.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-ibm - 6.8.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-oracle - 6.8.0-1015.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1016-oem - 6.8.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1014.21\nNo subscription required",
