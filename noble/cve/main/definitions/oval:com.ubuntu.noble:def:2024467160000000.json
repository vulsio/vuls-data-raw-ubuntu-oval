In consequence replace list_add_tail withlist_move_tail in msgdma_free_descriptor.This fixes the path:   msgdma_free_chan_resources -> msgdma_free_descriptors ->   msgdma_free_desc_list -> msgdma_free_descriptorwhich does not correctly free the descriptors as first nodes were notremoved from the list.",
