		"description": "The HTTP client drops sensitive headers after following a cross-domainredirect. For example, a request to a.com/ containing an Authorizationheader which is redirected to b.com/ will not send that header to b.com. Inthe event that the client received a subsequent same-domain redirect,however, the sensitive headers would be restored. For example, a chain ofredirects from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectlysend the Authorization header to b.com/2.",
