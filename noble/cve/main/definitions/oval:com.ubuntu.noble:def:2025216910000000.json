		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cachestat: fix page cache statistics permission checkingWhen the 'cachestat()' system call was added in commit cf264e1329fb(\"cachestat: implement cachestat syscall\"), it was meant to be a muchmore convenient (and performant) version of mincore() that didn't needmapping things into the user virtual address space in order to work.But it ended up missing the \"check for writability or ownership\" fix formincore(), done in commit 134fca9063ad (\"mm/mincore.c: make mincore()more conservative\").This just adds equivalent logic to 'cachestat()', modified for the filecontext (rather than vma).",
