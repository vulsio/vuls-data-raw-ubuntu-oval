		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: mdiobus: fix unbalanced node reference countI got the following report while doing device(mscc-miim) load testwith CONFIG_OF_UNITTEST and CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC enabled:  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:  attach overlay node /spi/soc@0/mdio@7107009c/ethernet-phy@0If the 'fwnode' is not an acpi node, the refcount is get infwnode_mdiobus_phy_device_register(), but it has never beenput when the device is freed in the normal path. So callfwnode_handle_put() in phy_device_release() to avoid leak.If it's an acpi node, it has never been get, but it's putin the error path, so call fwnode_handle_get() beforephy_device_register() to keep get/put operation balanced.",
