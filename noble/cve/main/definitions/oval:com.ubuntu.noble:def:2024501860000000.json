		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: explicitly clear the sk pointer, when pf->create failsWe have recently noticed the exact same KASAN splat as in commit6cd4a78d962b (\"net: do not leave a dangling sk pointer, when socketcreation fails\"). The problem is that commit did not fully address theproblem, as some pf->create implementations do not use sk_common_releasein their error paths.For example, we can use the same reproducer as in the above commit, butchanging ping to arping. arping uses AF_PACKET socket and if packet_createfails, it will just sk_free the allocated sk object.While we could chase all the pf->create implementations and make sure theyNULL the freed sk object on error from the socket, we can't guaranteefuture protocols will not make the same mistake.So it is easier to just explicitly NULL the sk pointer upon return frompf->create in __sock_create. We do know that pf->create always releases theallocated sk object on error, so if the pointer is not NULL, it isdefinitely dangling.",
