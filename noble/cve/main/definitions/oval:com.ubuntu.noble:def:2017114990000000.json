		"title": "CVE-2017-11499 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "Node.js v4.0 through v4.8.3, all versions of v5.x, v6.0 through v6.11.0,v7.0 through v7.10.0, and v8.0 through v8.1.3 was susceptible to hashflooding remote DoS attacks as the HashTable seed was constant across agiven released version of Node.js. This was a result of building with V8snapshots enabled by default which caused the initially randomized seed tobe overwritten on startup.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-11499` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnode108 - 4.8.4~dfsg-1ubuntu1\nnodejs - 4.8.4~dfsg-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
