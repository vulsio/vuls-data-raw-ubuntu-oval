		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/fbdev-dma: Only set smem_start is enable per module optionOnly export struct fb_info.fix.smem_start if that is required by theuser and the memory does not come from vmalloc().Setting struct fb_info.fix.smem_start breaks systems where DMAmemory is backed by vmalloc address space.
