		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:userfaultfd: fix checks for huge PMDsPatch series \"userfaultfd: fix races around pmd_trans_huge() check\", v2.The pmd_trans_huge() code in mfill_atomic() is wrong in three differentways depending on kernel version:1. The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if youhit   the right two race windows) - I've tested this in a kernel build with   some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description   of the race scenario.   On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even   theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table   if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven't tested this case).2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for   detecting PMDs that don't point to page tables.   On older kernels (before 6.5), you'd just have to win a single fairly   wide race to hit this.   I've tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()   patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86   VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr().3. On newer kernels (>=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed   to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven't tested that),   so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.I decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, onefix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernelsaffected by bugs 1+2.This patch (of 2):This fixes two issues.I discovered that the following race can occur:  mfill_atomic                other thread  ============                ============                              <zap PMD>  pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]  <bail if trans_huge>  <if none:>                              <pagefault creates transhuge zeropage>    __pte_alloc [no-op]                              <zap PMD>  <bail if pmd_trans_huge(*dst_pmd)>  BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))I have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls;the BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.On kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b (\"mm/pgtable: allowpte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail\"), this can't lead to anything worse thana BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed todeal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels(<=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the twoBUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.The second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other typesof huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can't catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs(in particular, migration PMDs).On <=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on aPMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single,fairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), whichassumes that the PMD points to a page table.Breakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which willcrash or maybe worse if there is no \"struct page\" for the address bits inthe migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is nocorresponding \"struct page\" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64looks different).If that didn't crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into whatit wrongly thinks is a page table.As part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge()before __pte_alloc() - that's redundant, we're going to have to check forthat after the __pte_alloc() anyway.Backport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels.",
