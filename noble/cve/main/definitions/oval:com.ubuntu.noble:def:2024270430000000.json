		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is setequal to dvbdev, which is freed in several error-handling paths. However,*pdvbdev is not set to NULL after dvbdev's deallocation, causinguse-after-frees in many places, for example, in the following call chain:budget_register |-> dvb_dmxdev_init |-> dvb_register_device |->dvb_dmxdev_release |-> dvb_unregister_device |-> dvb_remove_device |->dvb_device_put |-> kref_put When calling dvb_unregister_device,dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in dvb_register_device) could point to memorythat had been freed in dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer istransferred to kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-27043` to fix the vulnerability.
