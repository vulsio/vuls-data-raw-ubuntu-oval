		"title": "CVE-2024-42232 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:libceph: fix race between delayed_work() and ceph_monc_stop()The way the delayed work is handled in ceph_monc_stop() is prone toraces with mon_fault() and possibly also finish_hunting().  Both ofthese can requeue the delayed work which wouldn't be canceled by any ofthe following code in case that happens after cancel_delayed_work_sync()runs -- __close_session() doesn't mess with the delayed work in orderto avoid interfering with the hunting interval logic.  This part wasmissed in commit b5d91704f53e (\"libceph: behave in mon_fault() ifcur_mon < 0\") and use-after-free can still ensue on monc and objectsthat hang off of it, with monc->auth and monc->monmap beingparticularly susceptible to quickly being reused.To fix this:- clear monc->cur_mon and monc->hunting as part of closing the session  in ceph_monc_stop()- bail from delayed_work() if monc->cur_mon is cleared, similar to how  it's done in mon_fault() and finish_hunting() (based on monc->hunting)- call cancel_delayed_work_sync() after the session is closed\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42232` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic-64k - 6.8.0-48.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1018-aws - 6.8.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-azure - 6.8.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-gcp - 6.8.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-ibm - 6.8.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-oracle - 6.8.0-1015.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1016-oem - 6.8.0-1016.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1014.21\nNo subscription required",
