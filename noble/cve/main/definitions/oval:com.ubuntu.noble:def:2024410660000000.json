		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leakBelow is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb duringtransmit:    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;    consumer_index ++;Where variable data looks like this:    free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]                                               \tconsumer_index^    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed toa valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointedto an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map andtx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking anskb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stopsending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. Ifnot then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should bepatched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41066` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic-64k - 6.8.0-48.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1018-aws - 6.8.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-azure - 6.8.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-gcp - 6.8.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-ibm - 6.8.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-oracle - 6.8.0-1015.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-oracle-64k - 6.8.0-1015.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1014.21\nNo subscription required",
