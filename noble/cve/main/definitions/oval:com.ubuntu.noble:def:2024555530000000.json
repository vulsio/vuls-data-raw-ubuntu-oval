		"title": "CVE-2024-55553 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3 from 6.0 onward, all routes are re-validatedif the total size of an update received via RTR exceeds the internalsocket's buffer size, default 4K on most OSes. An attacker can use this totrigger re-parsing of the RIB for FRR routers using RTR by causing morethan this number of updates during an update interval (usually 30 minutes).Additionally, this effect regularly occurs organically. Furthermore, anattacker can use this to trigger route validation continuously. Given thatrouters with large full tables may need more than 30 minutes to fullyre-validate the table, continuous issuance/withdrawal of large numbers ofROA may be used to impact the route handling performance of all FRRinstances using RPKI globally. Additionally, the re-validation will causeheightened BMP traffic to ingestors. Fixed Versions: 10.0.3, 10.1.2,10.2.1, >= 10.3.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-55553` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfrr - 8.4.4-1.1ubuntu6.3\nfrr-pythontools - 8.4.4-1.1ubuntu6.3\nfrr-rpki-rtrlib - 8.4.4-1.1ubuntu6.3\nfrr-snmp - 8.4.4-1.1ubuntu6.3\nNo subscription required",
