The user thencloses the queue. However the close will also forcefully signal thesuspend fence after killing the queue, later when the G2H response fordisable_scheduling comes back we have now cleared suspend_pending whensignalling the suspend fence, so the disable_scheduling now incorrectlytries to also deregister the queue. This leads to warnings since the queuehas yet to even be marked for destruction. We also seem to triggererrors later with trying to double unregister the same queue.To fix this tweak the ordering when handling the response to ensure wedon't race with a disable_scheduling that didn't actually intend toperform an unregister.  The destruction path should now also correctlywait for any pending_disable before marking as destroyed.(cherry picked from commit f161809b362f027b6d72bd998e47f8f0bad60a2e)",
