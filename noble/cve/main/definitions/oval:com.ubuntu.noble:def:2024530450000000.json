Thisattribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before thearray is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or akernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.This patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated withlist_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used forallocating memory for the array. It is updated with the actual number ofadded elements after the array is filled.",
