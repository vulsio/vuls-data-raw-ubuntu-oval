When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev hasbeen set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,and as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it isattached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loopthen tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in thelist. Fix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms: - navigate in thelist with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to safely modify the listas we go through each element. For each element, remove it from the listwith list_del_rcu - make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after eachvif removal to make sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too(through unregister_netdev) Since we are in a RCU \"modifier\" path (not a\"reader\" path), and because such path is expected not to be concurrent toany other modifier (we are using the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to useRCU list API, that's why we can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.
