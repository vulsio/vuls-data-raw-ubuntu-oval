		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bus:mhi: core: Fix invalid error returning in mhi_queue mhi_queue returns anerror when the doorbell is not accessible in the current state. This canhappen when the device is in non M0 state, like M3, and needs to bewaken-up prior ringing the DB. This case is managed earlier by triggeringan asynchronous M3 exit via controller resume/suspend callbacks, that inturn will cause M0 transition and DB update. So, since it's not an errorbut just delaying of doorbell update, there is no reason to return anerror. This also fixes a use after free error for skb case, indeed a callerqueuing skb will try to free the skb if the queueing fails, but in thatcase queueing has been done.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46969` to fix the vulnerability.
