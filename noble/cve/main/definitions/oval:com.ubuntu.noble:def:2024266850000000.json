		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_write According to a syzbot report,end_buffer_async_write(), which handles the completion of block devicewrites, may detect abnormal condition of the buffer async_write flag andcause a BUG_ON failure when using nilfs2. Nilfs2 itself does not useend_buffer_async_write(). But, the async_write flag is now used as a markerby commit 7f42ec394156 (\"nilfs2: fix issue with race condition ofcompetition between segments for dirty blocks\") as a means of resolvingdouble list insertion of dirty blocks in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the resulting crash. This modificationis safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree node blocks wherethe page caches are independent. However, it was irrelevant and redundantto also introduce async_write for segment summary and super root blocksthat share buffers with the backing device. This led to the possibilitythat the BUG_ON check in end_buffer_async_write would fail as describedabove, if independent writebacks of the backing device occurred inparallel. The use of async_write for segment summary buffers has alreadybeen removed in a previous change. Fix this issue by removing themanipulation of the async_write flag for the remaining super root blockbuffer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26685` to fix the vulnerability.
