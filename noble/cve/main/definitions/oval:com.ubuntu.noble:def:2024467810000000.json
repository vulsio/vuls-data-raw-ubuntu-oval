		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix missing cleanup on rollforward recovery errorIn an error injection test of a routine for mount-time recovery, KASANfound a use-after-free bug.It turned out that if data recovery was performed using partial logscreated by dsync writes, but an error occurred before starting the logwriter to create a recovered checkpoint, the inodes whose data had beenrecovered were left in the ns_dirty_files list of the nilfs object andwere not freed.Fix this issue by cleaning up inodes that have read the recovery data ifthe recovery routine fails midway before the log writer starts.",
