		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: clk-loongson2: Fix memory corruption bug in structloongson2_clk_providerSome heap space is allocated for the flexible structure `structclk_hw_onecell_data` and its flexible-array member `hws` throughthe composite structure `struct loongson2_clk_provider` in function`loongson2_clk_probe()`, as shown below:289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;\t...296         for (p = data; p->name; p++)297                 clks_num++;298299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws,clks_num),300                            GFP_KERNEL);Then some data is written into the flexible array:350                 clp->clk_data.hws[p->id] = hw;This corrupts `clk_lock`, which is the spinlock variable immediatelyfollowing the `clk_data` member in `struct loongson2_clk_provider`:struct loongson2_clk_provider {\tvoid __iomem *base;\tstruct device *dev;\tstruct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;\tspinlock_t clk_lock;\t/* protect access to DIV registers */};The problem is that the flexible structure is currently placed in themiddle of `struct loongson2_clk_provider` instead of at the end.Fix this by moving `struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;` to the end of`struct loongson2_clk_provider`. Also, add a code comment to helpprevent this from happening again in case new members are added to thestructure in the future.This change also fixes the following -Wflex-array-member-not-at-endwarning:drivers/clk/clk-loongson2.c:32:36: warning: structure containing a flexiblearray member is not at the end of another structure[-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53193` to fix the vulnerability.
