		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_tableThe sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended.It could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.Here are more details:1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the timesequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and doout-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value`new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will bemoved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold.Meanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running withouttermination and out-of-bound write.2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elementswill just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment\"Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates\".For more details, please refer tohttps://lore.kernel.org/all/6dd0d822-046c-4dd2-9532-79d7ab96ec05@gmail.com.",
