		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: E-switch, Create ingress ACL when neededCurrently, ingress acl is used for three features. It is created onlywhen vport metadata match and prio tag are enabled. But active-backuplag mode also uses it. It is independent of vport metadata match andprio tag. And vport metadata match can be disabled using thefollowing devlink command: # devlink dev param set pci/0000:08:00.0 name esw_port_metadata \\\tvalue false cmode runtimeIf ingress acl is not created, will hit panic when creating drop rulefor active-backup lag mode. If always create it, there will be about5% performance degradation.Fix it by creating ingress acl when needed. If esw_port_metadata istrue, ingress acl exists, then create drop rule using existingingress acl. If esw_port_metadata is false, create ingress acl andthen create drop rule.",
