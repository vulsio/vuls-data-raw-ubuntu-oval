		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:leds: trigger: Unregister sysfs attributes before calling deactivate()Triggers which have trigger specific sysfs attributes typically storerelated data in trigger-data allocated by the activate() callback andfreed by the deactivate() callback.Calling device_remove_groups() after calling deactivate() leaves a windowwhere the sysfs attributes show/store functions could be called afterdeactivation and then operate on the just freed trigger-data.Move the device_remove_groups() call to before deactivate() to closethis race window.This also makes the deactivation path properly do things in reverse orderof the activation path which calls the activate() callback before callingdevice_add_groups().",
