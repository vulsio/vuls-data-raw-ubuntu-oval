		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:l2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflowWhen a session is created, it sets a backpointer to its tunnel. Whenthe session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnelrefcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel isset in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incrementedby l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window wheresession->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't beenbumped.Moving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial butl2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which usessession->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap. Add an encap arg tol2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session->tunnel.If l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible forl2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch asession which doesn't yet have session->tunnel set. Add a check forthis case.",
