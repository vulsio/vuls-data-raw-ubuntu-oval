		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: Fix improper handling of refcount in ice_dpll_init_rclk_pins()This patch addresses a reference count handling issue in theice_dpll_init_rclk_pins() function. The function calls ice_dpll_get_pins(),which increments the reference count of the relevant resources. However,if the condition WARN_ON((!vsi || !vsi->netdev)) is met, the functioncurrently returns an error without properly releasing the resourcesacquired by ice_dpll_get_pins(), leading to a reference count leak.To resolve this, the check has been moved to the top of the function. Thisensures that the function verifies the state before any resources areacquired, avoiding the need for additional resource management in theerror path.This bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developedby our team. The tool specializes in analyzing reference count operationsand detecting potential issues where resources are not properly managed.In this case, the tool flagged the missing release operation as apotential problem, which led to the development of this patch.",
