		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf: Fix perf_pending_task() UaFPer syzbot it is possible for perf_pending_task() to run after theevent is free()'d. There are two related but distinct cases: - the task_work was already queued before destroying the event; - destroying the event itself queues the task_work.The first cannot be solved using task_work_cancel() sinceperf_release() itself might be called from a task_work (____fput),which means the current->task_works list is already empty andtask_work_cancel() won't be able to find the perf_pending_task()entry.The simplest alternative is extending the perf_event lifetime to coverthe task_work.The second is just silly, queueing a task_work while you know theevent is going away makes no sense and is easily avoided byre-arranging how the event is marked STATE_DEAD and ensuring it goesthrough STATE_OFF on the way down.",
