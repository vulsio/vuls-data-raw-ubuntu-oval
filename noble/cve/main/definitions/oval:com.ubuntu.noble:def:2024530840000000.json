		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/imagination: Break an object reference loopWhen remaining resources are being cleaned up on driver close,outstanding VM mappings may result in resources being leaked, dueto an object reference loop, as shown below, with each object (orset of objects) referencing the object below it:    PVR GEM Object    GPU scheduler \"finished\" fence    GPU scheduler “scheduled” fence    PVR driver “done” fence    PVR Context    PVR VM Context    PVR VM Mappings    PVR GEM ObjectThe reference that the PVR VM Context has on the VM mappings is asoft one, in the sense that the freeing of outstanding VM mappingsis done as part of VM context destruction; no reference counts areinvolved, as is the case for all the other references in the loop.To break the reference loop during cleanup, free the outstandingVM mappings before destroying the PVR Context associated with theVM context.",
