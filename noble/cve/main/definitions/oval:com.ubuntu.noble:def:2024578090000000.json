		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: imx6: Fix suspend/resume support on i.MX6QDLThe suspend/resume functionality is currently broken on the i.MX6QDLplatform, as documented in the NXP errata (ERR005723):  https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX6DQCE.pdfThis patch addresses the issue by sharing most of the suspend/resumesequences used by other i.MX devices, while avoiding modifications tocritical registers that disrupt the PCIe functionality. It targets thesame problem as the following downstream commit:https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995Unlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIedevice if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10kor iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by thedriver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent withexisting practices.Upon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's anexample of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0,device inaccessible  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944Without this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if aPCIe device is connected.[kwilczynski: commit log, added tag for stable releases]",
