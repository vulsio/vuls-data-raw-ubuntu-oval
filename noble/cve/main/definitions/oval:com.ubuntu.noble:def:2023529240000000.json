		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: nf_tables: don't skip expired elements during walkThere is an asymmetry between commit/abort and preparation phase if thefollowing conditions are met:1. set is a verdict map (\"1.2.3.4 : jump foo\")2. timeouts are enabledIn this case, following sequence is problematic:1. element E in set S refers to chain C2. userspace requests removal of set S3. kernel does a set walk to decrement chain->use count for all elements   from preparation phase4. kernel does another set walk to remove elements from the commit phase   (or another walk to do a chain->use increment for all elements from    abort phase)If E has already expired in 1), it will be ignored during list walk, so itsuse countwon't have been changed.Then, when set is culled, ->destroy callback will zap the element vianf_tables_set_elem_destroy(), but this function is only safe forelements that have been deactivated earlier from the preparation phase:lack of earlier deactivate removes the element but leaks the chain usecount, which results in a WARN splat when the chain gets removed later,plus a leak of the nft_chain structure.Update pipapo_get() not to skip expired elements, otherwise flushcommand reports bogus ENOENT errors.",
