		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/xe: fix unbalanced rpm put() with fence_fini()Currently we can call fence_fini() twice if something goes wrong whensending the GuC CT for the tlb request, since we signal the fence andreturn an error, leading to the caller also calling fini() on the errorpath in the case of stack version of the flow, which leads to an extrarpm put() which might later cause device to enter suspend when itshouldn't. It looks like we can just drop the fini() call since thefence signaller side will already call this for us.There are known mysterious splats with device going to sleep even withan rpm ref, and this could be one candidate.v2 (Matt B):  - Prefer warning if we detect double fini()(cherry picked from commit cfcbc0520d5055825f0647ab922b655688605183)\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50144` to fix the vulnerability.
