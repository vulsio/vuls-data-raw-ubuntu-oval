		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iio:adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events AD7091R-5 devices aresupported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with the ad7091r-base driver.Those drivers declared iio events for notifying user space when ADCreadings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit registers or above thevalues set in high limit registers. However, to configure iio events andtheir thresholds, a set of callback functions must be implemented and thosewere not present until now. The consequence of trying to configuread7091r-5 events without the proper callback functions was a null pointerdereference in the kernel because the pointers to the callback functionswere not set. Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users toread/write event thresholds and enable/disable event generation. Since theevent spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices, also move those from thead7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reused when support forad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52627` to fix the vulnerability.
