		"description": "Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. Aremote client may send a request that is exactly recv_bytes (defaults to8192) long, followed by a secondary request using HTTP pipelining. Whenrequest lookahead is disabled (default) we won't read any more requests,and when the first request fails due to a parsing error, we simply closethe connection. However when request lookahead is enabled, it is possibleto process and receive the first request, start sending the error messageback to the client while we read the next request and queue it. This willallow the secondary request to be serviced by the worker thread while theconnection should be closed. Waitress 3.0.1 fixes the race condition. As aworkaround, disable channel_request_lookahead, this is set to 0 by defaultdisabling this feature.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-49768` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-waitress - 2.1.2-2ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
