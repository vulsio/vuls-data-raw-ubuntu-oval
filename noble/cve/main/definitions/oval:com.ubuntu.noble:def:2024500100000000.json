		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec checkBoth i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifactof the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for thecondition, but that got moved up in two commits:633fb6ac3980 (\"exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier\")0fd338b2d2cd (\"exec: move path_noexec() check earlier\")Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, whichhas some debug value.However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting inunwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowedand none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they weretested for.Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any permchecking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to beregular.Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindlessnonsense checking for guarantee that isn't given so drop the WARN.Reword the commentary and do small tidy ups while here.[brauner: keep redundant path_noexec() check]",
