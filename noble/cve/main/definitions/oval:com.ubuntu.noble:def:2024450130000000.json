		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()Commit 4733b65d82bd (\"nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup\")moves starting keep-alive from nvme_start_ctrl() intonvme_init_ctrl_finish(), but don't move stopping keep-alive intonvme_uninit_ctrl(), so keep-alive work can be started and keep pendingafter failing to start controller, finally use-after-free is triggered ifnvme host driver is unloaded.This patch fixes kernel panic when running nvme/004 in case that connectionfailure is triggered, by moving stopping keep-alive intonvme_uninit_ctrl().This way is reasonable because keep-alive is now started innvme_init_ctrl_finish().",
