The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic - 6.8.0-48.48\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-48-generic-64k - 6.8.0-48.48\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-azure - 6.8.0-1017.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1017-gcp - 6.8.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1015-ibm - 6.8.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required",
