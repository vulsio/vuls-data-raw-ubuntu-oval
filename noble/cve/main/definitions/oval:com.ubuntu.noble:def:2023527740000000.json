		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access Indasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue arecounted. The access to the device queue is unprotected against concurrentaccess. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with alias devices enabled,the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start() is accessing thequeue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic due to incorrectpointer accesses. Fix this by taking the device lock before accessing thequeue and counting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profiledata pointer can be done earlier to avoid unnecessary locking in a hotpath.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52774` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.8.0-11-generic - 6.8.0-11.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-11-generic - 6.8.0-11.11\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-11-generic-64k - 6.8.0-11.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-aws - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-azure - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1002-gcp - 6.8.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-ibm - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-7-lowlatency - 6.8.0-7.7.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-7-lowlatency-64k - 6.8.0-7.7.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1001-oracle - 6.8.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.7.0-1001-raspi - 6.7.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1001.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.7.0-2001-raspi-realtime - 6.7.0-2001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-realtime - 6.8.0-1008.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
