		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Add null check for 'afb' inamdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update (v2)This commit adds a null check for the 'afb' variable in theamdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update function. Previously, 'afb' wasassumed to be null, but was used later in the code without a null check.This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.Changes since v1:- Moved the null check for 'afb' to the line where 'afb' is used. (Alex)Fixes the below:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_plane.c:1298amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update() error: we previously assumed 'afb'could be null (see line 1252)",
