		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:virtio_net: Fix napi_skb_cache_put warningAfter the commit bdacf3e34945 (\"net: Use nested-BH locking fornapi_alloc_cache.\") was merged, the following warning began to appear:\t WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1 at net/core/skbuff.c:1451napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\t  __warn+0x12f/0x340\t  napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\t  napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\t  report_bug+0x165/0x370\t  handle_bug+0x3d/0x80\t  exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x50\t  asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\t  __free_old_xmit+0x1c8/0x510\t  napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\t  __free_old_xmit+0x1c8/0x510\t  __free_old_xmit+0x1c8/0x510\t  __pfx___free_old_xmit+0x10/0x10The issue arises because virtio is assuming it's running in NAPI contexteven when it's not, such as in the netpoll case.To resolve this, modify virtnet_poll_tx() to only set NAPI when budgetis available. Same for virtnet_poll_cleantx(), which always assumed thatit was in a NAPI context.",
