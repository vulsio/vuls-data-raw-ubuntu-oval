		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix 6 GHz scan constructionIf more than 255 colocated APs exist for the set of allAPs found during 2.4/5 GHz scanning, then the 6 GHz scanconstruction will loop forever since the loop variablehas type u8, which can never reach the number found whenthat's bigger than 255, and is stored in a u32 variable.Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.Using a u32 there is fine, we limit the number of APs inthe scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNRentries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scanresults, a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it'smore like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11,we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k, well inthe bounds of a u32.",
