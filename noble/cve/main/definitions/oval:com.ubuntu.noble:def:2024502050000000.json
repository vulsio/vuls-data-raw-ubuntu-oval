		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: firewire-lib: Avoid division by zero in apply_constraint_to_size()The step variable is initialized to zero. It is changed in the loop,but if it's not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable checkbefore the division.The observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b(\"ALSA: firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size\"),and it is difficult to show that any of the interval parameters willsatisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data from theamdtp_rate_table[] table.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
