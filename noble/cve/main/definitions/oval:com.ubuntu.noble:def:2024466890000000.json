		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC, not WBLinux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is writeprotected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache evictionas \"write\" into the write protected region leading to secure interruptwhich causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisormaps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translationtables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (likeXen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WCremoves dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patchfixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.I tested this on SA8155P with Xen.",
