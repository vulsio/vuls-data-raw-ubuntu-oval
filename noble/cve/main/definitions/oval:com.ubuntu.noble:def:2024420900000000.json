		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pinctrl: fix deadlock in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFERIn create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before callingadd_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl()calls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquirepinctrl_maps_mutex, which is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading toa potential deadlock.This patch resolves the issue by releasing pinctrl_maps_mutex beforecalling pinctrl_free(), preventing the deadlock.This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static AnalysisSecurity Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.",
