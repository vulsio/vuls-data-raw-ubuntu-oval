		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfs: Fix oops in nfs_netfs_init_request() when copying to cacheWhen netfslib wants to copy some data that has just been read on behalf ofnfs, it creates a new write request and calls nfs_netfs_init_request() toinitialise it, but with a NULL file pointer.  This causesnfs_file_open_context() to oops - however, we don't actually need the nfscontext as we're only going to write to the cache.Fix this by just returning if we aren't given a file pointer and emit awarning if the request was for something other than copy-to-cache.Further, fix nfs_netfs_free_request() so that it doesn't try to free thecontext if the pointer is NULL.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-57927` to fix the vulnerability.
