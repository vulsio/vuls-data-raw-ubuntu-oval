		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:firmware: qcom: scm: Mark get_wq_ctx() as atomic callCurrently get_wq_ctx() is wrongly configured as a standard call. When twoSMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() toresume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() isinterrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocateda waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.To avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standardSMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.",
