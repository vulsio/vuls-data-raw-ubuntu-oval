		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdevDuring successful probe, igc logs this:[    5.133667] igc 0000:01:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): PHCadded                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The reason is that igc_ptp_init() is called very early, even beforeregister_netdev() has been called. So the netdev_info() call workson a partially uninitialized netdev.Fix this by calling igc_ptp_init() after register_netdev(), rightafter the media autosense check, just as in igb.  Add a comment,just as in igb.Now the log message is fine:[    5.200987] igc 0000:01:00.0 eth0: PHC added",
