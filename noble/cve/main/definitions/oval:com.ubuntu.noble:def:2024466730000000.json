		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: aacraid: Fix double-free on probe failureaac_probe_one() calls hardware-specific init functions through theaac_driver_ident::init pointer, all of which eventually call down toaac_init_adapter().If aac_init_adapter() fails after allocating memory for aac_dev::queues,it frees the memory but does not clear that member.After the hardware-specific init function returns an error,aac_probe_one() goes down an error path that frees the memory pointed toby aac_dev::queues, resulting.in a double-free.",
