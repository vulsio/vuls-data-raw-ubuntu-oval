		"description": "Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. When Git LFSrequests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of thehost's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embeddedline-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receivesback from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By insertingURL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return(CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user'sGit credentials. This problem exists in all previous versions and ispatched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are noworkarounds known at this time.",
