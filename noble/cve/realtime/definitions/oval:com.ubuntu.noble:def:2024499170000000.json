		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for clk_mgr and clk_mgr->funcs indcn30_init_hwThis commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the`dcn30_init_hw` function. The issue could occur when `dc->clk_mgr` or`dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is null.The fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr` and `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` isnot null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential nullpointer dereference.Reported by smatch:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:789dcn30_init_hw() error: we previously assumed 'dc->clk_mgr' could be null(see line 628)",
