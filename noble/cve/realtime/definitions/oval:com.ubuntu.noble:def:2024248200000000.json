Not any of Icinga Director's configuration forms used to manipulatethe monitoring environment are protected against cross site request forgery(CSRF). It enables attackers to perform changes in the monitoringenvironment managed by Icinga Director without the awareness of the victim.Users of the map module in version 1.x, should immediately upgrade to v2.0.The mentioned XSS vulnerabilities in Icinga Web are already fixed as welland upgrades to the most recent release of the 2.9, 2.10 or 2.11 branchmust be performed if not done yet. Any later major release is alsosuitable. Icinga Director will receive minor updates to the 1.8, 1.9, 1.10and 1.11 branches to remedy this issue. Upgrade immediately to a patchedrelease. If that is not feasible, disable the director module for the timebeing.",
