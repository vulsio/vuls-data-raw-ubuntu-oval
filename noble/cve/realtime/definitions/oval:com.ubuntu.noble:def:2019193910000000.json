		"description": "** DISPUTED ** In LuaJIT through 2.0.5, as used in Moonjit before 2.1.2 andother products, debug.getinfo has a type confusion issue that leads toarbitrary memory write or read operations, because certain cases involvingvalid stack levels and > options are mishandled. NOTE: The LuaJIT projectowner states that the debug libary is unsafe by definition and that this isnot a vulnerability. When LuaJIT was originally developed, the expectationwas that the entire debug library had no security guarantees and thus itmade no sense to assign CVEs. However, not all users of later LuaJITderivatives share this perspective.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19391` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibluajit-5.1-2 - 2.1.0+git20231223.c525bcb+dfsg-1\nlibluajit-5.1-common - 2.1.0+git20231223.c525bcb+dfsg-1\nluajit - 2.1.0+git20231223.c525bcb+dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
