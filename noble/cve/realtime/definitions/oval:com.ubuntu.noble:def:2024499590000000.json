		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:jbd2: stop waiting for space when jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail() returns errorIn __jbd2_log_wait_for_space(), we might call jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()to recover some journal space. But if an error occurs while executingjbd2_cleanup_journal_tail() (e.g., an EIO), we don't stop waiting for freespace right away, we try other branches, and if j_committing_transactionis NULL (i.e., the tid is 0), we will get the following complain:============================================JBD2: I/O error when updating journal superblock for sdd-8.__jbd2_log_wait_for_space: needed 256 blocks and only had 217 spaceavailable__jbd2_log_wait_for_space: no way to get more journal space in sdd-8------------[ cut here ]------------WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 139804 at fs/jbd2/checkpoint.c:109__jbd2_log_wait_for_space+0x251/0x2e0Modules linked in:CPU: 2 PID: 139804 Comm: kworker/u8:3 Not tainted 6.6.0+ #1RIP: 0010:__jbd2_log_wait_for_space+0x251/0x2e0Call Trace: <TASK> add_transaction_credits+0x5d1/0x5e0 start_this_handle+0x1ef/0x6a0 jbd2__journal_start+0x18b/0x340 ext4_dirty_inode+0x5d/0xb0 __mark_inode_dirty+0xe4/0x5d0 generic_update_time+0x60/0x70[...]============================================So only if jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail() returns 1, i.e., there is nothing toclean up at the moment, continue to try to reclaim free space in otherways.Note that this fix relies on commit 6f6a6fda2945 (\"jbd2: fix ocfs2 corruptwhen updating journal superblock fails\") to make jbd2_cleanup_journal_tailreturn the correct error code.",
