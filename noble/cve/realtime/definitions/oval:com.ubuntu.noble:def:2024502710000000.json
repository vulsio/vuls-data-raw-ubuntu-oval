		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:signal: restore the override_rlimit logicPrior to commit d64696905554 (\"Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top ofucounts\") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class ofsignals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even ifoverride_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGVsignal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for thesignal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo.This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address andhandling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications areunaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo iseffectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior andcrashes, as we observed with java applications.Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skipthe comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectivelyrestores the old behavior.",
