		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thunderbolt: Mark XDomain as unplugged when router is removedI noticed that when we do discrete host router NVM upgrade and it getshot-removed from the PCIe side as a result of NVM firmware authentication,if there is another host connected with enabled paths we hang in tearingthem down. This is due to fact that the Thunderbolt networking driveralso tries to cleanup the paths and ends up blocking intb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() waiting for the domain lock.However, at this point we already cleaned the paths in tb_stop() sothere is really no need for tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() to do thatanymore. Furthermore it already checks if the XDomain is unplugged andbails out early so take advantage of that and mark the XDomain asunplugged when we remove the parent router.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46702` to fix the vulnerability.
