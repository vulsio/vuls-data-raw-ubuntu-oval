		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:efi/unaccepted: touch soft lockup during memory accept Commit 50e782a86c98(\"efi/unaccepted: Fix soft lockups caused by parallel memory acceptance\")has released the spinlock so other CPUs can do memory acceptance inparallel and not triggers softlockup on other CPUs. However the softlock upwas intermittent shown up if the memory of the TD guest is large, and thetimeout of softlockup is set to 1 second: RIP:0010:_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore Call Trace: ? __hrtimer_run_queues <IRQ> ?hrtimer_interrupt ? watchdog_timer_fn ? __sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt ?__pfx_watchdog_timer_fn ? sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt </IRQ> ?__hrtimer_run_queues <TASK> ? hrtimer_interrupt ?asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore ?__sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt ? sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt accept_memorytry_to_accept_memory do_huge_pmd_anonymous_page get_page_from_freelist__handle_mm_fault __alloc_pages __folio_alloc ? __tdx_hypercallhandle_mm_fault vma_alloc_folio do_user_addr_faultdo_huge_pmd_anonymous_page exc_page_fault ? __do_huge_pmd_anonymous_pageasm_exc_page_fault __handle_mm_fault When the local irq is enabled at theend of accept_memory(), the softlockup detects that the watchdog on singleCPU has not been fed for a while. That is to say, even other CPUs will notbe blocked by spinlock, the current CPU might be stunk with local irqdisabled for a while, which hurts not only nmi watchdog but alsosoftlockup. Chao Gao pointed out that the memory accept could be timecostly and there was similar report before. Thus to avoid any softlocupdetection during this stage, give the softlockup a flag to skip the timeoutcheck at the end of accept_memory(), by invokingtouch_softlockup_watchdog().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36936` to fix the vulnerability.
