		"description": "Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3contains a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability isthat it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the serverwhich sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing a maliciousserver to set cookies for unrelated domains. The cookie middleware isdisabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by thisissue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handlerstack or construct the client with ['cookies' => true] are affected.Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multipledomains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by thisvulnerability. Guzzle versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for thisissue. As a workaround, turn off the cookie middleware.",
