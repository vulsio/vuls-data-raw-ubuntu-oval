		"title": "CVE-2024-56780 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:quota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writebackOne of the paths quota writeback is called from is:freeze_super()  sync_filesystem()    ext4_sync_fs()      dquot_writeback_dquots()Since we currently don't always flush the quota_release_work queue inthis path, we can end up with the following race: 1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations. 2. FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_workqueue. 3. Freeze completes. 4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which    hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:  ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)  __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]  ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]  quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0Which is the following line:  WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);Which ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesgnoise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.To avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue duringdquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems afterfreeze.",
