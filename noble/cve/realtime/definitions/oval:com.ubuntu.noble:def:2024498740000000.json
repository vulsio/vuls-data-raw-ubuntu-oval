		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master DriverDue to Race ConditionIn the svc_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound withsvc_i3c_master_hj_work, &master->ibi_work is bound withsvc_i3c_master_ibi_work. And svc_i3c_master_ibi_work  can start thehj_work, svc_i3c_master_irq_handler can start the ibi_work.If we remove the module which will call svc_i3c_master_remove tomake cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregisterwhile the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operationsthat may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:CPU0                                         CPU1                                    | svc_i3c_master_hj_worksvc_i3c_master_remove               |i3c_master_unregister(&master->base)|device_unregister(&master->dev)     |device_release                      |//free master->base                 |                                    | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)                                    | //use master->baseFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with thecleanup in svc_i3c_master_remove.",
