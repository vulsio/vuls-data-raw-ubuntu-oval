The associated kmod for the PHY is now removed.The kmod is now added again and the port is now put up, the associated LEDare registered again.On putting the port down again for the second time after these step, theLED list now have 4 elements. With the first 2 already unregisteredpreviously and the 2 new one registered again.This cause a kernel panic as the first 2 element should have beenremoved.Fix this by correctly removing the element when LED is unregistered.",
