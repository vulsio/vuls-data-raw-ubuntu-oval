		"title": "CVE-2024-31081 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server'sProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function. This issue occurs when byte-swappedlength values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakageand segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with adifferent endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attackerto cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit themback to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in acrash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memorycopied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-31081` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nxnest - 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1\nxorg-server-source - 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1\nxserver-common - 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1\nxserver-xephyr - 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1\nxserver-xorg-core - 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1\nxserver-xorg-legacy - 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1\nxvfb - 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nxwayland - 2:23.2.6-1\nNo subscription required",
