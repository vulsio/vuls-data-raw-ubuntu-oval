		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drop_monitor: replace spin_lock by raw_spin_locktrace_drop_common() is called with preemption disabled, and it acquiresa spin_lock. This is problematic for RT kernels because spin_locks aresleeping locks in this configuration, which causes the following splat:BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context atkernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 449, name: rcuc/47preempt_count: 1, expected: 0RCU nest depth: 2, expected: 25 locks held by rcuc/47/449: #0: ff1100086ec30a60 ((softirq_ctrl.lock)){+.+.}-{2:2}, at:__local_bh_disable_ip+0x105/0x210 #1: ffffffffb394a280 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{1:2}, at:rt_spin_lock+0xbf/0x130 #2: ffffffffb394a280 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{1:2}, at:__local_bh_disable_ip+0x11c/0x210 #3: ffffffffb394a160 (rcu_callback){....}-{0:0}, at:rcu_do_batch+0x360/0xc70 #4: ff1100086ee07520 (&data->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at:trace_drop_common.constprop.0+0xb5/0x290irq event stamp: 139909hardirqs last  enabled at (139908): [<ffffffffb1df2b33>]_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x63/0x80hardirqs last disabled at (139909): [<ffffffffb19bd03d>]trace_drop_common.constprop.0+0x26d/0x290softirqs last  enabled at (139892): [<ffffffffb07a1083>]__local_bh_enable_ip+0x103/0x170softirqs last disabled at (139898): [<ffffffffb0909b33>]rcu_cpu_kthread+0x93/0x1f0Preemption disabled at:[<ffffffffb1de786b>] rt_mutex_slowunlock+0xab/0x2e0CPU: 47 PID: 449 Comm: rcuc/47 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc2-rt1+ #7Hardware name: Dell Inc.
