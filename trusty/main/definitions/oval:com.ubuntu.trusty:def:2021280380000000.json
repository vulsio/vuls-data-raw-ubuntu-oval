    "Title": "CVE-2021-28038 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3, as used with Xen PV. A certain part of the netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors). A host OS denial of service may occur during misbehavior of a networking frontend driver. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-26931. Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).",
