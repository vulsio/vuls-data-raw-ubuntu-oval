		"Title": "CVE-2022-1786 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s io_uring subsystem in the way a user sets up a ring with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL with more than one task completing submissions on this ring. This flaw allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system. Kyle Zeng discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
