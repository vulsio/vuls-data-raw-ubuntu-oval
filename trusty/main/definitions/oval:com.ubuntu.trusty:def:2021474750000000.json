		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: comedi:vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows The driver uses endpoint-sized USBtransfer buffers but up until recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.Commit e1f13c879a7c (\"staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize ofusb endpoints found\") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences whenaccessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a zerowMaxPacketSize. Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle alsothe other accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 invmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond thebuffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing. The original driverwas for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers. Support was later added fora device that uses bulk transfers and is presumably a full-speed devicewith a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.",
