		"description": "Zope is an open-source web application server. Zope versions prior toversions 4.6.3 and 5.3 have a remote code execution security issue. Inorder to be affected, one must use Python 3 for one's Zope deployment, runZope 4 below version 4.6.3 or Zope 5 below version 5.3, and have theoptional `Products.PythonScripts` add-on package installed. By default, onemust have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\" role to add or edit Script(Python) objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users toadd/edit these scripts through the web are at risk. Zope releases 4.6.3 and5.3 are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrictadding/editing Script (Python) objects through the web using the standardZope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not beassigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through theweb should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the defaultconfiguration in Zope.",
