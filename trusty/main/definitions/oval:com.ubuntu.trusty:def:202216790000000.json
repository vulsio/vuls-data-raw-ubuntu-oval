    "Title": "CVE-2022-1679 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Atheros wireless adapter driver in the way a user forces the ath9k_htc_wait_for_target function to fail with some input messages. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
