		"Description": "ip_reass in ip_input.c in libslirp 4.0.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a large packet because it mishandles a case involving the first fragment. It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host.",
