		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tls: fix use-after-free on failed backlog decryptionWhen the decrypt request goes to the backlog and crypto_aead_decryptreturns -EBUSY, tls_do_decryption will wait until all asyncdecryptions have completed. If one of them fails, tls_do_decryptionwill return -EBADMSG and tls_decrypt_sg jumps to the error path,releasing all the pages. But the pages have been passed to the asynccallback, and have already been released by tls_decrypt_done.The only true async case is when crypto_aead_decrypt returns -EINPROGRESS. With -EBUSY, we already waited so we can telltls_sw_recvmsg that the data is available for immediate copy, but weneed to notify tls_decrypt_sg (via the new ->async_done flag) that thememory has already been released.",
