    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.11. sg_write lacks an sg_remove_request call in a certain failure case, aka CID-83c6f2390040. It was discovered that the SCSI generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions correctly. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
