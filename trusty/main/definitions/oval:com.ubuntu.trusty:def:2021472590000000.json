		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: NFS:Fix use-after-free in nfs4_init_client() KASAN reports a use-after-freewhen attempting to mount two different exports through two different NICsthat belong to the same server. Olga was able to hit this with kernelsstarting somewhere between 5.7 and 5.10, but I traced the patch thatintroduced the clear_bit() call to 4.13. So something must have changed inthe refcounting of the clp pointer to make this call to nfs_put_client()the very last one.",
