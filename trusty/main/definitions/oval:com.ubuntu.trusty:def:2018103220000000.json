    "Title": "CVE-2018-10322 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The xfs_dinode_verify function in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_inode_buf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (xfs_ilock_attr_map_shared invalid pointer dereference) via a crafted xfs image. Wen Xu discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inode metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
