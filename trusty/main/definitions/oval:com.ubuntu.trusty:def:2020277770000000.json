    "Title": "CVE-2020-27777 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way RTAS handled memory accesses in userspace to kernel communication. On a locked down (usually due to Secure Boot) guest system running on top of PowerVM or KVM hypervisors (pseries platform) a root like local user could use this flaw to further increase their privileges to that of a running kernel. Daniel Axtens discovered that PowerPC RTAS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict memory accesses in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to arbitrarily modify kernel memory, potentially bypassing kernel lockdown restrictions.",
