		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:mac80211: fix potential key use-after-free When ieee80211_key_link() iscalled by ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() but returns 0 due to KRACK protection(identical key reinstall), ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() will still return apointer into the key, in a potential use-after-free. This normally doesn'thappen since it's only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offloadwhich has its own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, do that byreturning an error code and converting that to success on the cfg80211boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers ofieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52530` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-254-generic - 4.4.0-254.288~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-254-generic - 4.4.0-254.288~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-254-lowlatency - 4.4.0-254.288~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1131-aws - 4.4.0-1131.137\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1177-azure - 4.15.0-1177.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
