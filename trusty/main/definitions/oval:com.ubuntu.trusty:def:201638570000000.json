A local attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-3857` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
