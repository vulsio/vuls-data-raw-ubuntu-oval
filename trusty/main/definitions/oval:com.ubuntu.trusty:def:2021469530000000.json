		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ACPI: GTDT: Don't corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failureWhen failing the driver probe because of invalid firmware properties,the GTDT driver unmaps the interrupt that it mapped earlier.However, it never checks whether the mapping of the interrupt actiallysucceeded. Even more, should the firmware report an illegal interruptnumber that overlaps with the GIC SGI range, this can result in anIPI being unmapped, and subsequent fireworks (as reported by DannFrazier).Rework the driver to have a slightly saner behaviour and actuallycheck whether the interrupt has been mapped before unmapping things.",
