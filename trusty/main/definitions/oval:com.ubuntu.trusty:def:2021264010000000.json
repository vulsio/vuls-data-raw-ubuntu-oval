    "Description": "LFENCE/JMP (mitigation V2-2) may not sufficiently mitigate CVE-2017-5715 on some AMD CPUs. Ke Sun, Alyssa Milburn, Henrique Kawakami, Emma Benoit, Igor Chervatyuk, Lisa Aichele, and Thais Moreira Hamasaki discovered that the Spectre Variant 2 mitigations for AMD processors on Linux were insufficient in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
