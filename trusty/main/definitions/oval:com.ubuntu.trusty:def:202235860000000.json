		"Title": "CVE-2022-3586 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service. Gwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
