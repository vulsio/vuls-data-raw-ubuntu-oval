    "Title": "CVE-2015-3885 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "Integer overflow in the ljpeg_start function in dcraw 7.00 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted image, which triggers a buffer overflow, related to the len variable. It was discovered that FreeImage incorrectly handled photo files. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted photo file, a remote attacker could cause FreeImage to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-3885` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibraw-bin - 0.15.4-1ubuntu0.1\nlibraw9 - 0.15.4-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
