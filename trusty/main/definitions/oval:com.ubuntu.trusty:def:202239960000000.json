		"Title": "CVE-2022-3996 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low",
		"Description": "If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policyprocessing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively.On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denialof service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabledon a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policyprocessing is enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command lineutilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablementwas corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.",
