		"Title": "CVE-2019-16714 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.2.14, rds6_inc_info_copy in net/rds/recv.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory because tos and flags fields are not initialized. It was discovered that the IPv6 RDS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize fields in a data structure returned to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). Please note that the RDS protocol is blacklisted in Ubuntu by default.",
