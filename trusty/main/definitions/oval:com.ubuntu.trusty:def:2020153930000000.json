		"Title": "CVE-2020-15393 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel 4.4 through 5.7.6, usbtest_disconnect in drivers/usb/misc/usbtest.c has a memory leak, aka CID-28ebeb8db770. Kyungtae Kim discovered that the USB testing driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory on disconnect events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
