		"Title": "CVE-2020-25211 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.8.7, local attackers able to inject conntrack netlink configuration could overflow a local buffer, causing crashes or triggering use of incorrect protocol numbers in ctnetlink_parse_tuple_filter in net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_netlink.c, aka CID-1cc5ef91d2ff. It was discovered that the netfilter connection tracker for netlink in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
