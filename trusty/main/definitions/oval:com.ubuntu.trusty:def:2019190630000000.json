		"Title": "CVE-2019-19063 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "Two memory leaks in the rtl_usb_probe() function in drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-3f9361695113. It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
