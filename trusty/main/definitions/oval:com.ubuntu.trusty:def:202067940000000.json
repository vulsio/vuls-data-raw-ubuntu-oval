		"description": "If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a masterpassword, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. Thisis because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data wascopied to a new format starting in Thunderbird 60. The new master passwordis added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of storedpassword data outside of user expectations. This vulnerability affectsThunderbird < 68.5.",
