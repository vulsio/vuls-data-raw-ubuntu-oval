		"Title": "CVE-2020-36322 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as CVE-2021-28950. It was discovered that the FUSE user space file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
