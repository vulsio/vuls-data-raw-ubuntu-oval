		"title": "CVE-2018-18955 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map_write() inkernel/user_namespace.c allows privilege escalation because it mishandlesnested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. A user who hasCAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access controls onresources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by reading /etc/shadow.This occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly for thenamespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaceddirection.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18955` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1035-azure - 4.15.0-1035.36~14.04.2\nNo subscription required",
