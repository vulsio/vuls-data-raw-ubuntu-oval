		"description": "It was found that the net_dma code in tcp_recvmsg() in the 2.6.32 kernel asshipped in RHEL6 is thread-unsafe. So an unprivileged multi-threadeduserspace application calling recvmsg() for the same network socket inparallel executed on ioatdma-enabled hardware with net_dma enabled can leakthe memory, crash the host leading to a denial-of-service or cause a randommemory corruption.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3837` to fix the vulnerability.
