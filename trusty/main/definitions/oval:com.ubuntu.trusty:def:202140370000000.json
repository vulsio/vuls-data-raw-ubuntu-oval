		"Title": "CVE-2021-4037 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS. Christian Brauner discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file creation. A local attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges.",
