		"Description": "A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write inthe heap area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap datacorruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent secureboot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as anattacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout to achievesignifcant results, also the values written into the memory are repeatedthree times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flawaffects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.",
