		"Title": "CVE-2023-20588 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "A division-by-zero error on some AMD processors can potentially return speculative data resulting in loss of confidentiality. Jana Hofmann, Emanuele Vannacci, Cedric Fournet, Boris Kopf, and Oleksii Oleksenko discovered that some AMD processors could leak stale data from division operations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
