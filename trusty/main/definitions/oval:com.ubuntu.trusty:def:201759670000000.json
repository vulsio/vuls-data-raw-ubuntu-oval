    "Title": "CVE-2017-5967 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The time subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.9.9, when CONFIG_TIMER_STATS is enabled, allows local users to discover real PID values (as distinguished from PID values inside a PID namespace) by reading the /proc/timer_list file, related to the print_timer function in kernel/time/timer_list.c and the __timer_stats_timer_set_start_info function in kernel/time/timer.c. It was discovered that the timer stats implementation in the Linux kernel allowed the discovery of a real PID value while inside a PID namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5967` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
