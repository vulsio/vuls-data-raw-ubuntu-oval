		"Title": "CVE-2022-29581 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14 and later versions. Kyle Zeng discovered that the Network Queuing and Scheduling subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
