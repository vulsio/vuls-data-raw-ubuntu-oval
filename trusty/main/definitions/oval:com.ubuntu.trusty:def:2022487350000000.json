		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ALSA:hda: Fix UAF of leds class devs at unbinding The LED class devices that arecreated by HD-audio codec drivers are registered viadevm_led_classdev_register() and associated with the HD-audio codec device.Unfortunately, it turned out that the devres release doesn't work for thiscase; namely, since the codec resource release happens before the devm callchain, it triggers a NULL dereference or a UAF for a staleset_brightness_delay callback. For fixing the bug, this patch changes theLED class device register and unregister in a manual manner without devres,keeping the instances in hda_gen_spec.",
