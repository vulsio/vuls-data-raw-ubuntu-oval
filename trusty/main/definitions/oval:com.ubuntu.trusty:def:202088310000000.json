		"description": "Apport creates a world writable lock file with root ownership in the worldwritable /var/lock/apport directory. If the apport/ directory does notexist (this is not uncommon as /var/lock is a tmpfs), it will create thedirectory, otherwise it will simply continue execution using the existingdirectory. This allows for a symlink attack if an attacker were to create asymlink at /var/lock/apport, changing apport's lock file location. Thisfile could then be used to escalate privileges, for example. Fixed inversions 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.23, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.14, 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.8 and2.20.11-0ubuntu22.",
