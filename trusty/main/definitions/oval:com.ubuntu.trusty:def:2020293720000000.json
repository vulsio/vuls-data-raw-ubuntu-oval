		"Title": "CVE-2020-29372 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in do_madvise in mm/madvise.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6.8. There is a race condition between coredump operations and the IORING_OP_MADVISE implementation, aka CID-bc0c4d1e176e. Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the madvise implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
