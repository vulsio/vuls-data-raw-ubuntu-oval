		"Title": "CVE-2019-9515 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentiallyleading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGSframes to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with oneacknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almostequivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data isqueued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.",
