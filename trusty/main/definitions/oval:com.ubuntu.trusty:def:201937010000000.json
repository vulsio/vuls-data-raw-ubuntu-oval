		"Title": "CVE-2019-3701 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linuxkernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwiselogical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. Theprivileged user \"root\" with CAP_NET_ADMIN can create a CAN framemodification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than theavailable CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksumcalculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data(e.g. cgw_csum_xor_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag_list pointer inskb_shared_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash.Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary contentbeyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory whenprocessing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3701` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1040-aws - 4.4.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required",
