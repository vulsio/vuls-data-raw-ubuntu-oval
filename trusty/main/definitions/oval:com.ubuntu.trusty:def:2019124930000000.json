    "Title": "CVE-2019-12493 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer over-read exists in PostScriptFunction::transform in Function.cc in Xpdf 4.01.01 because GfxSeparationColorSpace and GfxDeviceNColorSpace mishandle tint transform functions. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftops tool. It might allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service or leak memory data.",
