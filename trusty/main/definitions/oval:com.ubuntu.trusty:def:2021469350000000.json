		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcelsIn 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d (\"android: binder: Move buffer out of areashared with user space\")fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads sothe driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronoustransactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.Unfortunately, on the \"free\" side, the accounting of async_free_spacedid not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes ofasync_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes orless.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issuehas gone undetected for several years.The fix is to use \"buffer_size\" (the allocated buffer size) instead of\"size\" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_spaceduring the free operation. These are the same except for thiscorner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes.",
