		"Title": "CVE-2020-8616 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "A malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effectivelimitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referralscan, through the use of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursingserver to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process thereferral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance of therecursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional workrequired to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit thisbehavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attackwith a high amplification factor.",
