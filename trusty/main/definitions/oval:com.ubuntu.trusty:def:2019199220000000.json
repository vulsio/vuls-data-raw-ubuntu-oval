		"Title": "CVE-2019-19922 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "kernel/sched/fair.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9, when cpu.cfs_quota_usis used (e.g., with Kubernetes), allows attackers to cause a denial ofservice against non-cpu-bound applications by generating a workload thattriggers unwanted slice expiration, aka CID-de53fd7aedb1. (In other words,although this slice expiration would typically be seen with benignworkloads, it is possible that an attacker could calculate how many strayrequests are required to force an entire Kubernetes cluster into alow-performance state caused by slice expiration, and ensure that a DDoSattack sent that number of stray requests. An attack does not affect thestability of the kernel; it only causes mismanagement of applicationexecution.)",
