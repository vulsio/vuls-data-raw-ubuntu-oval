		"title": "CVE-2019-1125 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when certain centralprocessing units (CPU) speculatively access memory. An attacker whosuccessfully exploited the vulnerability could read privileged data acrosstrust boundaries. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have tolog on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. Thevulnerability would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly,but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try tocompromise the affected system further. On January 3, 2018, Microsoftreleased an advisory and security updates related to a newly-discoveredclass of hardware vulnerabilities (known as Spectre) involving speculativeexecution side channels that affect AMD, ARM, and Intel CPUs to varyingdegrees. This vulnerability, released on August 6, 2019, is a variant ofthe Spectre Variant 1 speculative execution side channel vulnerability andhas been assigned CVE-2019-1125. Microsoft released a security update onJuly 9, 2019 that addresses the vulnerability through a software changethat mitigates how the CPU speculatively accesses memory. Note that thisvulnerability does not require a microcode update from your device OEM.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-1125` to fix the vulnerability.
