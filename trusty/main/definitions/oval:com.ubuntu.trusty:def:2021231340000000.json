    "Description": "Use After Free vulnerability in nfc sockets in the Linux Kernel before 5.12.4 allows local attackers to elevate their privileges. In typical configurations, the issue can only be triggered by a privileged local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability. Or Cohen and Nadav Markus discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the nfc implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
