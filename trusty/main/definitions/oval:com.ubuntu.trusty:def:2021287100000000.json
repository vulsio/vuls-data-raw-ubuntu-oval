		"Description": "certain VT-d IOMMUs may not work in shared page table mode For efficiencyreasons, address translation control structures (page tables) may (and, onsuitable hardware, by default will) be shared between CPUs, forsecond-level translation (EPT), and IOMMUs. These page tables are presentlyset up to always be 4 levels deep. However, an IOMMU may require the use ofjust 3 page table levels. In such a configuration the lop level table needsto be stripped before inserting the root table's address into the hardwarepagetable base register. When sharing page tables, Xen erroneously skippedthis stripping. Consequently, the guest is able to write to leaf page tableentries.",
