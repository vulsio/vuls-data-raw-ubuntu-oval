		"Title": "CVE-2020-25600 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Out of bounds event channelsare available to 32-bit x86 domains. The so called 2-level event channelmodel imposes different limits on the number of usable event channels for32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either bitness) ones. 32-bit x86domains can use only 1023 channels, due to limited space in their shared(between guest and Xen) information structure, whereas all other domainscan use up to 4095 in this model. The recording of the respective limitduring domain initialization, however, has occurred at a time where domainsare still deemed to be 64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respectivedomain properties. At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, thelimit didn't get updated accordingly. Due to this misbehavior in Xen,32-bit domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may observeevent channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail.Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly lead tocorruption of other parts of the shared info structure. An unprivilegedguest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0, to misbehave. Thismay lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xenversions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier arenot vulnerable. Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains arevulnerable. Arm systems, as well as x86 64-bit domains, are not vulnerable.",
