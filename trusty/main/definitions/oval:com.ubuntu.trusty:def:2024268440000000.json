The reasonis that syzcaller managed to generate a request witha transfer direction of SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV. This instructsthe kernel to copy user buffers into the kernel, read intothe copied buffers and then copy the data back to user space.Thus the iovec is used in both directions.Detect this situation in the block layer and construct a newiterator with the correct direction for the copy-in.",
