    "Title": "CVE-2019-20810 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "go7007_snd_init in drivers/media/usb/go7007/snd-go7007.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6 does not call snd_card_free for a failure path, which causes a memory leak, aka CID-9453264ef586. Chuhong Yuan discovered that go7007 USB audio device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some failure conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
