		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix incorrect page releaseUnder the following conditions:1) No skb created yet2) header_size == 0 (no SHAMPO header)3) header_index + 1 % MLX5E_SHAMPO_WQ_HEADER_PER_PAGE == 0 (this is the   last page fragment of a SHAMPO header page)a new skb is formed with a page that is NOT a SHAMPO header page (itis a regular data page). Further down in the same function(mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_shampo()), a SHAMPO header page fromheader_index is released. This is wrong and it leads to SHAMPO headerpages being released more than once.",
