    "Title": "CVE-2018-16880 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handle_rx() function in the [vhost_net] driver. A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, can trigger an out-of-bounds write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may lead to a kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. Versions from v4.16 and newer are vulnerable. Jason Wang discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained an out of bounds write vulnerability. An attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host kernel.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-16880` to fix the vulnerability.
