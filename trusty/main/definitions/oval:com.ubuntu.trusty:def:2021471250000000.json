		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sch_htb: fix refcount leak in htb_parent_to_leaf_offload The commitae81feb7338c (\"sch_htb: fix null pointer dereference on a null new_q\")fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug, but it is not correct. Becausehtb_graft_helper properly handles the case when new_q is NULL, and afterthe previous patch by skipping this call which creates an inconsistency :dev_queue->qdisc will still point to the old qdisc, but cl->parent->leaf.qwill point to the new one (which will be noop_qdisc, because new_q wasNULL). The code is based on an assumption that these two pointers are thesame, so it can lead to refcount leaks. The correct fix is to add a NULLpointer check to protect qdisc_refcount_inc insidehtb_parent_to_leaf_offload.",
