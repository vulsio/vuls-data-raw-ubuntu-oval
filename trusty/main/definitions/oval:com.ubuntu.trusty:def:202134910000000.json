    "Title": "CVE-2021-3491 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "The io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed the MAX_RW_COUNT limit to be bypassed in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which led to negative values being usedin mem_rw when reading /proc/<PID>/mem. This could be used to create a heap overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel. It was addressed via commit d1f82808877b (\"io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers\") (v5.13-rc1) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced in ddf0322db79c (\"io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS\") (v5.7-rc1). Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong discovered that the io_uring implementation of the Linux kernel did not properly enforce the MAX_RW_COUNT limit in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
