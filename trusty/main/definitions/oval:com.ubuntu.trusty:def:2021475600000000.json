		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mlxsw:spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware When processing port up/downevents generated by the device's firmware, the driver protects itself fromevents reported for non-existent local ports, but not the CPU port (localport 0), which exists, but lacks a netdev. This can result in a NULLpointer dereference when calling netif_carrier_{on,off}(). Fix this bybailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU port. Problemwas only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.",
