    "Title": "CVE-2023-2235 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel Performance Events system can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The perf_group_detach function did not check the event's siblings' attach_state before calling add_event_to_groups(), but remove_on_exec made it possible to call list_del_event() on before detaching from their group, making it possible to use a dangling pointer causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit fd0815f632c24878e325821943edccc7fde947a2. It was discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
