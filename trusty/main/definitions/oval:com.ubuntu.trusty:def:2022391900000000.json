    "Description": "An issue was discovered in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.6. A denial of service can occur upon binding to an already bound chain. Gwangun Jung discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent binding to an already bound chain. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
