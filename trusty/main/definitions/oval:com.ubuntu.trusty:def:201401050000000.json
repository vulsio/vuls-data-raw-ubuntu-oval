    "Description": "The auth_token middleware in the OpenStack Python client library for Keystone (aka python-keystoneclient) before 0.7.0 does not properly retrieve user tokens from memcache, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges in opportunistic circumstances via a large number of requests, related to an \"interaction between eventlet and python-memcached.\"\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-0105` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nkeystone - 1:2014.1-0ubuntu1\npython-keystone - 1:2014.1-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\npython-keystoneclient - 1:0.7.1-ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
