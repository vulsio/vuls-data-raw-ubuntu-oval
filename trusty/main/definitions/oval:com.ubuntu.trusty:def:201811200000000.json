Bymmap()ing a FUSE-backed file onto a process's memory containing commandline arguments (or environment strings), an attacker can cause utilitiesfrom psutils or procps (such as ps, w) or any other program which makes aread() call to the /proc/<pid>/cmdline (or /proc/<pid>/environ) files toblock indefinitely (denial of service) or for some controlled time (as asynchronization primitive for other attacks).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1120` to fix the vulnerability.
