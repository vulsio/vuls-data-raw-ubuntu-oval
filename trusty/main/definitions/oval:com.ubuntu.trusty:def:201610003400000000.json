		"description": "In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions 1.51 to 1.55, a carrypropagation bug was introduced in the implementation of squaring forseveral raw math classes have been fixed(org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our customelliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), sothere was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculationsfor elliptic curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have beendetected with high probability by the output validation for our scalarmultipliers.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-1000340` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibbcmail-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nlibbcpg-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nlibbcpkix-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nlibbcprov-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nNo subscription required",
