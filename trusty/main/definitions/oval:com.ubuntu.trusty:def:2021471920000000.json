		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi:core: sysfs: Fix hang when device state is set via sysfs This fixes aregression added with: commit f0f82e2476f6 (\"scsi: core: Fix capacity setto zero after offlinining device\") The problem is that after iSCSIrecovery, iscsid will call into the kernel to set the dev's state torunning, and with that patch we now call scsi_rescan_device() with thestate_mutex held. If the SCSI error handler thread is just starting to testthe device in scsi_send_eh_cmnd() then it's going to try to grab thestate_mutex. We are then stuck, because when scsi_rescan_device() tries tosend its I/O scsi_queue_rq() calls -> scsi_host_queue_ready() ->scsi_host_in_recovery() which will return true (the host state is still inrecovery) and I/O will just be requeued. scsi_send_eh_cmnd() will thennever be able to grab the state_mutex to finish error handling. To preventthe deadlock move the rescan-related code to after we drop the state_mutex.This also adds a check for if we are already in the running state. Thisprevents extra scans and helps the iscsid case where if the transport classhas already onlined the device during its recovery process then we don'tneed userspace to do it again plus possibly block that daemon.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47192` to fix the vulnerability.
