		"description": "A missing authorization flaw was found in the libvirt API responsible forchanging the QEMU agent response timeout. This flaw allows read-onlyconnections to adjust the time that libvirt waits for the QEMU guest agentto respond to agent commands. Depending on the timeout value that is set,this flaw can make guest agent commands fail because the agent cannotrespond in time. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abusethis flaw to set the response timeout for all guest agent messages to zero,potentially leading to a denial of service. This flaw affects libvirtversions before 6.2.0.",
