		"description": "** DISPUTED ** The QMP guest_exec command in QEMU 4.0.0 and earlier isprone to OS command injection, which allows the attacker to achieve codeexecution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending acrafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been disputedas a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by trustedusers. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to theinternet, then it is an insecure configuration issue.",
