    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem. It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).",
