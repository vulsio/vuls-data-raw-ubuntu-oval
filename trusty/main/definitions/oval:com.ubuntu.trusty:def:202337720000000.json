		"Title": "CVE-2023-3772 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to directly dereference a NULL pointer in xfrm_update_ae_params(), leading to a possible kernel crash and denial of service. Lin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
