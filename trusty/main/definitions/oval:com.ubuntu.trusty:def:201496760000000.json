    "Title": "CVE-2014-9676 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The seg_write_packet function in libavformat/segment.c in ffmpeg 2.1.4 and earlier does not free the correct memory location, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (\"invalid memory handler\") and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted video that triggers a use after free. It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain media files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
