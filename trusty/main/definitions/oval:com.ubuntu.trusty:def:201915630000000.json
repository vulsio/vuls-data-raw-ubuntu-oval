		"Description": "In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of thesuccess or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending avery large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that wasencrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracleattack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate togetherwith the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions toselect the correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d(Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).",
