		"Title": "CVE-2020-12654 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was found in Linux kernel before 5.5.4. mwifiex_ret_wmm_get_status() in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/wmm.c allows a remote AP to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow because of an incorrect memcpy, aka CID-3a9b153c5591. It was discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex Driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate status lengths in messages received from an access point, leading to a buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker controlling an access point could use this to construct messages that could possibly result in arbitrary code execution.",
