		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: hwrng:core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng There is a dead-lock inthe hwrng device read path. This triggers when the user reads from/dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from /dev/hwrng. The resulting pagefault triggers a recursive read which then dead-locks. Fix this by using astack buffer when calling copy_to_user.",
