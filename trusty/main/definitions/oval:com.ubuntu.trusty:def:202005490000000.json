    "Description": "Cleanup errors in some data cache evictions for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. It was discovered that on some Intel processors, data from the most recently evicted modified L1 data cache (L1D) line may be propagated into an unused (invalid) L1D fill buffer. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
