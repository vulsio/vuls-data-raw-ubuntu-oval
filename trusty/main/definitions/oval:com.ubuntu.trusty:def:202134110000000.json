    "Title": "CVE-2021-3411 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to 5.10. A violation of memory access was found while detecting a padding of int3 in the linking state. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. Adam Zabrocki discovered that the kprobes subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly detect linker padding in some situations. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
