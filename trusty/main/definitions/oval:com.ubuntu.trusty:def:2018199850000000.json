    "Title": "CVE-2018-19985 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The function hso_get_config_data in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.8 reads if_num from the USB device (as a u8) and uses it to index a small array, resulting in an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read that potentially allows arbitrary read in the kernel address space. Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the Option USB High Speed driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata received from the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-19985` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1039-aws - 4.4.0-1039.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nNo subscription required",
