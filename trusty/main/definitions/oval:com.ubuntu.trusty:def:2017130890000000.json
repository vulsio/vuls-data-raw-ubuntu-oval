		"description": "The http.c:skip_short_body() function is called in some circumstances, suchas when processing redirects. When the response is sent chunked in wgetbefore 1.19.2, the chunk parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length,but doesn't check that the chunk length is a non-negative number. The codethen tries to skip the chunk in pieces of 512 bytes by using the MIN()macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk length toconnect.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32 bitsof the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completelyattacker controlled length argument.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-13089` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nwget - 1.15-1ubuntu1.14.04.3\nNo subscription required",
