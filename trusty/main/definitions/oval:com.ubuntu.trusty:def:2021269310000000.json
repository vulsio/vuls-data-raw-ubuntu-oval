		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as usedin Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug,deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at leastunder the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn'tcorrect to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing suchcrashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affectsdrivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.",
