		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS41+ subsystem. NFS41+ sharesmounted in different network namespaces at the same time can makebc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and cause a use-after-freevulnerability. Thus a malicious container user can cause a host kernelmemory corruption and a system panic.
