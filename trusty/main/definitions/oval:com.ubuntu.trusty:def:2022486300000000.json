		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZThe commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the elsebranch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' isnot a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:    kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/nullThere are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', butthey all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.Tested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.",
