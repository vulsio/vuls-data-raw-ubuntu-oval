    "Title": "CVE-2019-13272 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux deny_ptrace might be a usable workaround in some environments. Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges.",
