		"Title": "CVE-2013-7397 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips X.509 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary certificate during use of a typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration that does not send client certificates. It was discovered that AsyncHttpClient did not properly validate SSL/TLS certificates. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute a man-in-the-middle attack.",
