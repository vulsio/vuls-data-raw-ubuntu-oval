		"Title": "CVE-2017-15537 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The x86/fpu (Floating Point Unit) subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.13.5, when a processor supports the xsave feature but not the xsaves feature, does not correctly handle attempts to set reserved bits in the xstate header via the ptrace() or rt_sigreturn() system call, allowing local users to read the FPU registers of other processes on the system, related to arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c and arch/x86/kernel/fpu/signal.c. Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Floating Point Unit (fpu) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle attempts to set reserved bits in a task's extended state (xstate) area. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-15537` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-generic - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-lowlatency - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-98-generic - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-generic - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-lowlatency - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-98-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-98-generic - 4.4.0-98.121~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
