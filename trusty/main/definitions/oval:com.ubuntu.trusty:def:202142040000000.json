    "Description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF due to an Improper Input Validation. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special privilege to crash the system or leak internal information. It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the memory size of certain ring buffer operation arguments. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
