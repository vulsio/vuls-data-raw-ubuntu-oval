		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: act_skbmod: Skip non-Ethernet packetsCurrently tcf_skbmod_act() assumes that packets use Ethernet as their L2protocol, which is not always the case.  As an example, for CAN devices:\t$ ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan\t$ ip link set up vcan0\t$ tc qdisc add dev vcan0 root handle 1: htb\t$ tc filter add dev vcan0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 10 \\\t\tmatchall action skbmod swap macDoing the above silently corrupts all the packets.  Do not perform skbmodactions for non-Ethernet packets.",
