		"Title": "CVE-2021-33655 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "When sending malicous data to kernel by ioctl cmd FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO,kernel will write memory out of bounds. It was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of- bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
