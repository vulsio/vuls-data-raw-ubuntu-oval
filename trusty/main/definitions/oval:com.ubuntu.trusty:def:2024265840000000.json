		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests Since we're setting theCRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS invalid situations. For example, when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full(easy to trigger with an artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen),requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,the async callback will also be called twice: first with err ==-EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the newtls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS toavoid having to modify all the error handling paths. The handling isidentical.",
