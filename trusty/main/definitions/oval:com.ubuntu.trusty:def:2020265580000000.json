    "Title": "CVE-2020-26558 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time. It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform access control. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
