		"Title": "CVE-2017-17712 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "The raw_sendmsg() function in net/ipv4/raw.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.6 has a race condition in inet->hdrincl that leads to uninitialized stack pointer usage; this allows a local user to execute code and gain privileges. Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the IPv4 raw socket implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to uninitialized pointer usage. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-17712` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1014-aws - 4.4.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-generic - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-lowlatency - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-116-generic - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-generic - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-lowlatency - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-116-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-116-generic - 4.4.0-116.140~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
