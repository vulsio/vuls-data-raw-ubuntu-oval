		"Title": "CVE-2022-2586 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "It was discovered that a nft object or expression could reference a nft set on a different nft table, leading to a use-after-free once that table was deleted. It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not prevent one nft object from referencing an nft set in another nft table, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
