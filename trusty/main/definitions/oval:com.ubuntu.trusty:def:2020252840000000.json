    "Title": "CVE-2020-25284 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The rbd block device driver in drivers/block/rbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.8.9 used incomplete permission checking for access to rbd devices, which could be leveraged by local attackers to map or unmap rbd block devices, aka CID-f44d04e696fe. It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform privilege checks for access to rbd devices in some situations. A local attacker could use this to map or unmap rbd block devices.",
