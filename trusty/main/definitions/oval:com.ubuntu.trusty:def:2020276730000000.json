		"Title": "CVE-2020-27673 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.9.1, as used with Xen through 4.14.x. Guest OS users can cause a denial of service (host OS hang) via a high rate of events to dom0, aka CID-e99502f76271. Julien Grall discovered that the Xen dom0 event handler in the Linux kernel did not properly limit the number of events queued. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS.",
