    "Title": "CVE-2022-22942 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the vmwgfx driver that allows unprivileged users to gain access to files opened by other processes on the system through a dangling 'file' pointer. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have access to either /dev/dri/card0 or /dev/dri/rendererD128 and be able to issue an ioctl() on the resulting file descriptor. Systems without the vmwgfx driver loaded are not affected. It was discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain failure conditions, leading to a stale entry in the file descriptor table. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly gain administrative privileges.",
