		"description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, drivers/block/floppy.c allows a denial ofservice by setup_format_params division-by-zero. Two consecutive ioctls cantrigger the bug: the first one should set the drive geometry with .sect and.rate values that make F_SECT_PER_TRACK be zero. Next, the floppy formatoperation should be called. It can be triggered by an unprivileged localuser even when a floppy disk has not been inserted.
