		"Title": "CVE-2018-12207 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "Improper invalidation for page table updates by a virtual guest operating system for multiple Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service of the host system via local access. Deepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel did not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual guest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash).",
