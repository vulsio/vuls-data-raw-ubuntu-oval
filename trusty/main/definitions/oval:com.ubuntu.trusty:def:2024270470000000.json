		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:phy: fix phy_get_internal_delay accessing an empty array Thephy_get_internal_delay function could try to access to an empty array inthe case that the driver is calling phy_get_internal_delay without definingdelay_values and rx-internal-delay-ps or tx-internal-delay-ps is defined to0 in the device-tree. This will lead to \"unable to handle kernel NULLpointer dereference at virtual address 0\". To avoid this kernel oops, thetest should be delay >= 0. As there is already delay < 0 test just before,the test could only be size == 0.",
