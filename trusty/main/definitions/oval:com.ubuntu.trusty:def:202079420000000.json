		"description": "Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificatewas entitled to all information in the system and that a compromisedcertificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When anode's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can beretrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. Thisissue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in`puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet 6.13.0 and 5.5.19 changes thedefault behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It isrecommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that arenot upgrading still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure securebehavior. Affected software versions: Puppet 6.x prior to 6.13.0 PuppetAgent 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet 5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.xprior to 5.5.19 Resolved in: Puppet 6.13.0 Puppet Agent 6.13.0 Puppet5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.19",
