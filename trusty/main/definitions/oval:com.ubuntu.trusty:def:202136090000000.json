    "Title": "CVE-2021-3609 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": ".A flaw was found in the CAN BCM networking protocol in the Linux kernel, where a local attacker can abuse a flaw in the CAN subsystem to corrupt memory, crash the system or escalate privileges. This race condition in net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel allows for local privilege escalation to root. Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
