		"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI, itkeeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer forholding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it isadded via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number ofelements in this buffer, but it's off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can't affectadjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.",
