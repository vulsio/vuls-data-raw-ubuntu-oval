    "Description": "CVE-2023-4881 was wrongly assigned to a bug that was deemed to be a non-security issue by the Linux kernel security team. Alex Birnberg discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate register length, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
