    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.3.10, there is a use-after-free (read) in the perf_trace_lock_acquire function (related to include/trace/events/lock.h). Tristan Madani discovered that the file locking implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information.",
