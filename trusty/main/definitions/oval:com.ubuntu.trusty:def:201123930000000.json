    "Title": "CVE-2011-2393 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and possibly other BSD-based operating systems allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and device hang) by sending many Router Advertisement (RA) messages with different source addresses, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2010-4670.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2011-2393` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required",

For this CVE we seemed to be fixed by the first git commit so use that as 'fix'."
