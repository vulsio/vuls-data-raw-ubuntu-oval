		"Description": "When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature,thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XMLfile.The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the samecontentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by differentservers and theclient can then download the file from one or several ofthem. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting thecontents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on thatserver is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when thehash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove thecontents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is notdone, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and thepotentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.",
