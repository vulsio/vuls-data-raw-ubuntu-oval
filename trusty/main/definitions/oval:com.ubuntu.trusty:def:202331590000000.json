    "Description": "A use after free issue was discovered in driver/firewire in outbound_phy_packet_callback in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with special privilege may cause a use after free problem when queue_event() fails. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) implementation in the Linux kernel.
