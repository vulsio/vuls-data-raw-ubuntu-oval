		"Title": "CVE-2020-9383 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.5.6. set_fdc in drivers/block/floppy.c leads to a wait_til_ready out-of-bounds read because the FDC index is not checked for errors before assigning it, aka CID-2e90ca68b0d2. Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
