		"Title": "CVE-2018-14633 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "A security flaw was found in the chap_server_compute_md5() function in theISCSI target code in the Linux kernel in a way an authentication requestfrom an ISCSI initiator is processed. An unauthenticated remote attackercan cause a stack buffer overflow and smash up to 17 bytes of the stack.The attack requires the iSCSI target to be enabled on the victim host.Depending on how the target's code was built (i.e. depending on a compiler,compile flags and hardware architecture) an attack may lead to a systemcrash and thus to a denial-of-service or possibly to a non-authorizedaccess to data exported by an iSCSI target. Due to the nature of the flaw,privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it ishighly unlikely. Kernel versions 4.18.x, 4.14.x and 3.10.x are believed tobe vulnerable.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-14633` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-generic - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-lowlatency - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-160.210\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-160-generic - 3.13.0-160.210\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-137-generic - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-137-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-137-lowlatency - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-137-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-137-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-137-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-137-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-137-generic - 4.4.0-137.163~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1031-aws - 4.4.0-1031.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1030-azure - 4.15.0-1030.31~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
