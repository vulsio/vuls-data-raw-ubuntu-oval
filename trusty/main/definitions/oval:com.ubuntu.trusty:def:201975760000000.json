		"Description": "SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9 has a heap-based buffer over-read in InitMS_ADPCM in audio/SDL_wave.c (outside the wNumCoef loop). It was discovered that SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) did not properly handle certain crafted input, resulting in a heap-based buffer over-read. An attacker could use this to cause SDL to crash or leak sensitive information.",
