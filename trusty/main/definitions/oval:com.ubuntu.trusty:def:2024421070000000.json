		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabledThe ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release() andresult in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.Panic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function callsptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver has alreadyreleased the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next externaltimestamp event occurs.To fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check thePTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready.",
