    "Title": "CVE-2022-1973 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel in log_replay in fs/ntfs3/fslog.c in the NTFS journal. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system and leads to a kernel information leak problem. Gerald Lee discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
