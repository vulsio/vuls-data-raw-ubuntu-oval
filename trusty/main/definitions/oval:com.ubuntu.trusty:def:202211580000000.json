		"Title": "CVE-2022-1158 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in KVM. When updating a guest's page table entry, vm_pgoff was improperly used as the offset to get the page's pfn. As vaddr and vm_pgoff are controllable by user-mode processes, this flaw allows unprivileged local users on the host to write outside the userspace region and potentially corrupt the kernel, resulting in a denial of service condition. Qiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan and Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform guest page table updates in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm could possibly use this to crash the host OS.",
