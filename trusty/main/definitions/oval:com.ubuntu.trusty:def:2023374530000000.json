    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel through 6.4.2. There is an out-of-bounds and crash in read_descriptors in drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c. It was discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition while handling device descriptors in certain situations, leading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
