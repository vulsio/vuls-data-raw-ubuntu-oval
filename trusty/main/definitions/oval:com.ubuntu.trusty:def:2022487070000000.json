		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoderNot all decoders have a reset callback.The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port tohave no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes thereare none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoderinstance without a commit/reset callback.Prior to this patch, the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally whencalling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge,1 Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXLtype 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a nullpointer dereference.Before the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region, anda pass through decoder is reset.The issue can be reproduced as below,    1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a    single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.    2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.",
