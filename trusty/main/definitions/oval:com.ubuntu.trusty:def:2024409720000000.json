		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: do not create EA inode under buffer lockext4_xattr_set_entry() creates new EA inodes while holding buffer lockon the external xattr block. This is problematic as it nests all theallocation locking (which acquires locks on other buffers) under thebuffer lock. This can even deadlock when the filesystem is corrupted ande.g. quota file is setup to contain xattr block as data block. Move theallocation of EA inode out of ext4_xattr_set_entry() into the callers.",
