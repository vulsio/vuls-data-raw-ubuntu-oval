		"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.11 through 5.10.16, as usedby Xen. To service requests to the PV backend, the driver maps grantreferences provided by the frontend. In this process, errors may beencountered. In one case, an error encountered earlier might be discardedby later processing, resulting in the caller assuming successful mapping,and hence subsequent operations trying to access space that wasn't mapped.In another case, internal state would be insufficiently updated, preventingsafe recovery from the error. This affectsdrivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c.",
