		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the selinux-policy (aka Reference Policy)package 3.14 through 2020-08-24 because the .config/Yubico directory ismishandled. Consequently, when SELinux is in enforced mode, pam-u2f is notallowed to read the user's U2F configuration file. If configured with thenouserok option (the default when configured by the authselect tool), andthat file cannot be read, the second factor is disabled. An attacker withonly the knowledge of the password can then log in, bypassing 2FA.",
