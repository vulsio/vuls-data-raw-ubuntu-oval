		"Title": "CVE-2019-1551 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low",
		"Description": "There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure usedin exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536,and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to performand are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered justfeasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directlyusing the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they useBN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed inOpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).",
