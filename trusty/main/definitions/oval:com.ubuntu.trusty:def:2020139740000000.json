		"Title": "CVE-2020-13974 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.4 through 5.7.1. drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue in this case. It was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use this to have an unspecified impact.",
