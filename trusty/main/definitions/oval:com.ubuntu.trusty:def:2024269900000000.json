		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:x86/mmu: Write-protect L2 SPTEs in TDP MMU when clearing dirty status Checkkvm_mmu_page_ad_need_write_protect() when deciding whether to write-protector clear D-bits on TDP MMU SPTEs, so that the TDP MMU accounts for anyrole-specific reasons for disabling D-bit dirty logging. Specifically, TDPMMU SPTEs must be write-protected when the TDP MMU is being used to run anL2 (i.e. L1 has disabled EPT) and PML is enabled. KVM always disables PMLwhen running L2, even when L1 and L2 GPAs are in the some domain, sofailing to write-protect TDP MMU SPTEs will cause writes made by L2 to notbe reflected in the dirty log.
