		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algotcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it writesto &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also setsca->flags |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced.This has the unintended side-effect of changing the globalnet.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl, despite the fact that itis read-only: 97684f0970f6 (\"net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_controlreadonly in non-init netns\")Resolve this netns \"leak\" by only allowing the init netns to set thedefault algorithm to one that is restricted. This restriction could beremoved if tcp_allowed_congestion_control were namespace-ified in thefuture.This bug was uncovered withhttps://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-netns-sysctl-verify",
