    "Title": "CVE-2023-3111 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use after free vulnerability was found in prepare_to_relocate in fs/btrfs/relocation.c in btrfs in the Linux Kernel. This possible flaw can be triggered by calling btrfs_ioctl_balance() before calling btrfs_ioctl_defrag(). It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
