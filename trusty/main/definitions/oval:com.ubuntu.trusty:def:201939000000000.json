    "Title": "CVE-2019-3900 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An infinite loop issue was found in the vhost_net kernel module in Linux Kernel up to and including v5.1-rc6, while handling incoming packets in handle_rx(). It could occur if one end sends packets faster than the other end can process them. A guest user, maybe remote one, could use this flaw to stall the vhost_net kernel thread, resulting in a DoS scenario. Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.",
