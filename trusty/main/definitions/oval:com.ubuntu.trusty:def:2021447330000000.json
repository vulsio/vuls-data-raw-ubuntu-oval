		"Title": "CVE-2021-44733 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object. It was discovered that the ARM Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
