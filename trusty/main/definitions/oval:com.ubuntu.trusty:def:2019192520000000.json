		"Title": "CVE-2019-19252 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "vcs_write in drivers/tty/vt/vc_screen.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.13 does not prevent write access to vcsu devices, aka CID-0c9acb1af77a. Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or have other unspecified impacts.",
