    "Title": "CVE-2022-3977 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel MCTP (Management Component Transport Protocol) functionality. This issue occurs when a user simultaneously calls DROPTAG ioctl and socket close happens, which could allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the MCTP implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
