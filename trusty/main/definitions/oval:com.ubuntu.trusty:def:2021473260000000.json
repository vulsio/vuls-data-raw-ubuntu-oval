		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/signal: Detect and prevent an alternate signal stack overflowThe kernel pushes context on to the userspace stack to prepare for theuser's signal handler. When the user has supplied an alternate signalstack, via sigaltstack(2), it is easy for the kernel to verify that thestack size is sufficient for the current hardware context.Check if writing the hardware context to the alternate stack will exceedit's size. If yes, then instead of corrupting user-data and proceeding withthe original signal handler, an immediate SIGSEGV signal is delivered.Refactor the stack pointer check code from on_sig_stack() and use the newhelper.While the kernel allows new source code to discover and use a sufficientalternate signal stack size, this check is still necessary to protectbinaries with insufficient alternate signal stack size from datacorruption.",
