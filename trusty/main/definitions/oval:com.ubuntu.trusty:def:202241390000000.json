		"Title": "CVE-2022-4139 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An incorrect TLB flush issue was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s GPU i915 kernel driver, potentially leading to random memory corruption or data leaks. This flaw could allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
