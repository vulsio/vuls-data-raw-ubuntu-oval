		"Title": "CVE-2019-14861 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.xbefore 4.11.3 have an issue, where the (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipeprovides administrative facilities to modify DNS records and zones. Samba,when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP. In AD, the defaultpermissions on the DNS partition allow creation of new records byauthenticated users. This is used for example to allow machines toself-register in DNS. If a DNS record was created that case-insensitivelymatched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare()routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNSentries when responding to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() andso following invalid memory as a pointer.",
