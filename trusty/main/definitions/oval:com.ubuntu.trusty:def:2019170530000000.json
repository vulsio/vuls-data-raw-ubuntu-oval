		"Description": "ieee802154_create in net/ieee802154/socket.c in the AF_IEEE802154 network module in the Linux kernel through 5.3.2 does not enforce CAP_NET_RAW, which means that unprivileged users can create a raw socket, aka CID-e69dbd4619e7. Ori Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.",
