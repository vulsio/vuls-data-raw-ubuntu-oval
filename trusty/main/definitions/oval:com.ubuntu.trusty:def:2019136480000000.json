    "Title": "CVE-2019-13648 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.2.1 on the powerpc platform, when hardware transactional memory is disabled, a local user can cause a denial of service (TM Bad Thing exception and system crash) via a sigreturn() system call that sends a crafted signal frame. This affects arch/powerpc/kernel/signal_32.c and arch/powerpc/kernel/signal_64.c. Praveen Pandey discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly validate sent signals in some situations on PowerPC systems with transactional memory disabled. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
