    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16.11. The mixed IPID assignment method with the hash-based IPID assignment policy allows an off-path attacker to inject data into a victim's TCP session or terminate that session. Xuewei Feng, Chuanpu Fu, Qi Li, Kun Sun, and Ke Xu discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle IPID assignment. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (connection termination) or inject forged data.",
