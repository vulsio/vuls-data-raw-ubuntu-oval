		"description": "** DISPUTED ** Buffer overflow in the SQLDriverConnect function in unixODBC2.0.10, 2.3.1, and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service(crash) via a long string in the FILEDSN option. NOTE: this issue might notbe a vulnerability, since the ability to set this option typically impliesthat the attacker already has legitimate access to cause a DoS or executecode, and therefore the issue would not cross privilege boundaries. Theremay be limited attack scenarios if isql command-line options are exposed toan attacker, although it seems likely that other, more serious issues wouldalso be exposed, and this issue might not cross privilege boundaries inthat context.",
