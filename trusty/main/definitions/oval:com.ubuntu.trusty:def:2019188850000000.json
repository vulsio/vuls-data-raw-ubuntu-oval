		"Title": "CVE-2019-18885 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "fs/btrfs/volumes.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1 allows a btrfs_verify_dev_extents NULL pointer dereference via a crafted btrfs image because fs_devices->devices is mishandled within find_device, aka CID-09ba3bc9dd15. It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
