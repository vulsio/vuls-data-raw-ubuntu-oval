		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA overinfiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernelstack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cmdevice node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive userinformation, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protectionmechanisms.",
