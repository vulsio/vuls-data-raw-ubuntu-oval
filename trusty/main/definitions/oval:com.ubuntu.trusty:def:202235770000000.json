		"Title": "CVE-2022-3577 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Kid-friendly Wired Controller driver. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It is in bigben_probe of drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c. The reason is incorrect assumption - bigben devices all have inputs. However, malicious devices can break this assumption, leaking to out-of-bound write.",
