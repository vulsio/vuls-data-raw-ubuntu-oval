    "Title": "CVE-2019-15117 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "parse_audio_mixer_unit in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9 mishandles a short descriptor, leading to out-of-bounds memory access. Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
