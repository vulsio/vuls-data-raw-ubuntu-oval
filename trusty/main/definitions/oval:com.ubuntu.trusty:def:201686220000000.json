		"description": "The URL percent-encoding decode function in libcurl before 7.51.0 is called`curl_easy_unescape`. Internally, even if this function would be made toallocate a unscape destination buffer larger than 2GB, it would return thatnew length in a signed 32 bit integer variable, thus the length would geteither just truncated or both truncated and turned negative. That couldthen lead to libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-8622` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nlibcurl3 - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nNo subscription required",
