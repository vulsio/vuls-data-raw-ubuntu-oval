    "Title": "CVE-2016-5412 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S in the Linux kernel through 4.7 on PowerPC platforms, when CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV is enabled, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS infinite loop) by making a H_CEDE hypercall during the existence of a suspended transaction. It was discovered that the powerpc and powerpc64 hypervisor-mode KVM implementation in the Linux kernel for did not properly maintain state about transactional memory. An unprivileged attacker in a guest could cause a denial of service (CPU lockup) in the host OS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-5412` to fix the vulnerability.
