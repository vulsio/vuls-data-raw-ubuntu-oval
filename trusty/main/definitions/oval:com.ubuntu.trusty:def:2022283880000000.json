		"Description": "usb_8dev_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/usb_8dev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has a double free. It was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
