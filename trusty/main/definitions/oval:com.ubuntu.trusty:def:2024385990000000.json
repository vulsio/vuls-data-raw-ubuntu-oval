		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: jffs2:prevent xattr node from overflowing the eraseblock Add a check to make surethat the requested xattr node size is no larger than the eraseblock minusthe cleanmarker. Unlike the usual inode nodes, the xattr nodes aren't splitinto parts and spread across multiple eraseblocks, which means that a xattrnode must not occupy more than one eraseblock. If the requested xattr valueis too large, the xattr node can spill onto the next eraseblock,overwriting the nodes and causing errors such as: jffs2: argh. node addedin wrong place at 0x0000b050(2) jffs2: nextblock 0x0000a000, expected at0000b00c jffs2: error: (823) do_verify_xattr_datum: node CRC failed at0x01e050, read=0xfc892c93, calc=0x000000 jffs2: notice: (823)jffs2_get_inode_nodes: Node header CRC failed at 0x01e00c.{848f,2fc4,0fef511f,59a3d171} jffs2: Node at 0x0000000c with length0x00001044 would run over the end of the erase block jffs2: Perhaps thefile system was created with the wrong erase size? jffs2:jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): Magic bitmask 0x1985 not found at 0x00000010:0x1044 instead This breaks the filesystem and can lead to KASAN crashessuch as: BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in jffs2_sum_add_kvec+0x125e/0x15d0Read of size 4 at addr ffff88802c31e914 by task repro/830 CPU: 0 PID: 830Comm: repro Not tainted 6.9.0-rc3+ #1 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC(i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS Arch Linux 1.16.3-1-1 04/01/2014 Call Trace:<TASK> dump_stack_lvl+0xc6/0x120 print_report+0xc4/0x620 ?__virt_addr_valid+0x308/0x5b0 kasan_report+0xc1/0xf0 ?jffs2_sum_add_kvec+0x125e/0x15d0 ? jffs2_sum_add_kvec+0x125e/0x15d0jffs2_sum_add_kvec+0x125e/0x15d0 jffs2_flash_direct_writev+0xa8/0xd0jffs2_flash_writev+0x9c9/0xef0 ? __x64_sys_setxattr+0xc4/0x160 ?do_syscall_64+0x69/0x140 ? entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e [...]Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
