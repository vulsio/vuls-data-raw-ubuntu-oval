		"description": "In Python before 3.10.3 on Windows, local users can gain privileges becausethe search path is inadequately secured. The installer may allow a localattacker to add user-writable directories to the system search path. Toexploit, an administrator must have installed Python for all users andenabled PATH entries. A non-administrative user can trigger a repair thatincorrectly adds user-writable paths into PATH, enabling search-pathhijacking of other users and system services. This affects Python (CPython)through 3.7.12, 3.8.x through 3.8.12, 3.9.x through 3.9.10, and 3.10.xthrough 3.10.2.",
