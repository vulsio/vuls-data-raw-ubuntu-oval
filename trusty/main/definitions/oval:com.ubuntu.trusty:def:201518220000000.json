    "Title": "CVE-2015-1822 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "chrony before 1.31.1 does not initialize the last \"next\" pointer when saving unacknowledged replies to command requests, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a large number of command requests. Miroslav Lichvár discovered that chrony does't initialize the pointer properly. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-1822` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nchrony - 1.29-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
