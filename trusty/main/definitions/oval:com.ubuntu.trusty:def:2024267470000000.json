		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: roles: fix NULL pointer issue when put module's referenceIn current design, usb role class driver will get usb_role_switch parent'smodule reference after the user get usb_role_switch device and put thereference after the user put the usb_role_switch device. However, theparent device of usb_role_switch may be removed before the user put theusb_role_switch. If so, then, NULL pointer issue will be met when the userput the parent module's reference.This will save the module pointer in structure of usb_role_switch. Then,we don't need to find module by iterating long relations.",
