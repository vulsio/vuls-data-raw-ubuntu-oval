    "Title": "CVE-2019-18198 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.3.4, a reference count usage error in the fib6_rule_suppress() function in the fib6 suppression feature of net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c, when handling the FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF flag, can be exploited by a local attacker to corrupt memory, aka CID-ca7a03c41753. It was discovered that the IPv6 routing implementation in the Linux kernel contained a reference counting error leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
