    "Title": "CVE-2020-29371 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in romfs_dev_read in fs/romfs/storage.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.4. Uninitialized memory leaks to userspace, aka CID-bcf85fcedfdd. Jann Horn discovered that the romfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate file system meta-data, leading to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious romfs image that, when mounted, exposed sensitive information (kernel memory).",
