    "Title": "CVE-2022-42722 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.8 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16, local attackers able to inject WLAN frames into the mac80211 stack could cause a NULL pointer dereference denial-of-service attack against the beacon protection of P2P devices. Sönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
