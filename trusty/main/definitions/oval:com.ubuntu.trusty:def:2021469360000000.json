		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: fix use-after-free in tw_timer_handlerA real world panic issue was found as follow in Linux 5.4.    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffde49a863de28    PGD 7e6fe62067 P4D 7e6fe62067 PUD 7e6fe63067 PMD f51e064067 PTE 0    RIP: 0010:tw_timer_handler+0x20/0x40    Call Trace:     <IRQ>     call_timer_fn+0x2b/0x120     run_timer_softirq+0x1ef/0x450     __do_softirq+0x10d/0x2b8     irq_exit+0xc7/0xd0     smp_apic_timer_interrupt+0x68/0x120     apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20This issue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1],unfortunately, the issue was still can be reproduced after fixingDCCP.The ipv4_mib_exit_net is called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a netnamespace is destroyed since tcp_sk_ops is registered befroreipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is in the front of ipv4_mib_opsin the list of pernet_list. There will be a use-after-free onnet->mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_netif there are some inflight time-wait timers.This bug is not introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 (\"mib: add net toNET_ADD_STATS_BH\") since the net_statistics is a global variableinstead of dynamic allocation and freeing. Actually, commit61a7e26028b9 (\"mib: put net statistics on struct net\") introducesthe bug since it put net statistics on struct net and free it whennet namespace is destroyed.Moving init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bugand replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaninglesswhen init_ipv4_mibs() fails.[1]https://groups.google.com/g/syzkaller/c/p1tn-_Kc6l4/m/smuL_FMAAgAJ?pli=1",
