		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the sdma_init() function indrivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/sdma.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allowsattackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggeringrhashtable_init() failures, aka CID-34b3be18a04e. NOTE: This has beendisputed as not a vulnerability because \"rhashtable_init() can only fail ifit is passed invalid values in the second parameter's struct, but wheninvoked from sdma_init() that is a pointer to a static const struct, so anattacker could only trigger failure if they could corrupt kernel memory (inwhich case a small memory leak is not a significant problem).\"",
