    "Title": "CVE-2019-19071 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the rsi_send_beacon() function in drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi_91x_mgmt.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering rsi_prepare_beacon() failures, aka CID-d563131ef23c. It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
