    "Title": "CVE-2023-3338 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DECnet networking protocol. This issue could allow a remote user to crash the system. Davide Ornaghi discovered that the DECnet network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. Please note that kernel support for the DECnet has been removed to resolve this CVE.",
