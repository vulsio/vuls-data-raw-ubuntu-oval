		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Bluetooth: qca: fix NULL-deref on non-serdev suspend Qualcomm ROMEcontrollers can be registered from the Bluetooth line discipline and inthis case the HCI UART serdev pointer is NULL. Add the missing sanity checkto prevent a NULL-pointer dereference when wakeup() is called for anon-serdev controller during suspend. Just return true for now to restorethe original behaviour and address the crash with pre-6.2 kernels, which donot have commit e9b3e5b8c657 (\"Bluetooth: hci_qca: only assign wakeup withserial port support\") that causes the crash to happen already at setup()time.",
