    "Title": "CVE-2020-0067 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In f2fs_xattr_generic_list of xattr.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not required for exploitation.Product: Android. Versions: Android kernel. Android ID: A-120551147. It was discovered that the F2FS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking on xattrs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
