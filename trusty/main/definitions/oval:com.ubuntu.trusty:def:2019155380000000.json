		"Description": "An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in theLinux kernel through 5.2.9. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails onaccount of being out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing tounlock the ILOCK after the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This isprimarily a local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remoteDoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS.",
