    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_interrupt.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: The security community disputes this issues as not being serious enough to be deserving a CVE id. It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
