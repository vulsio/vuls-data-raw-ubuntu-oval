		"Title": "CVE-2019-14615 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Insufficient control flow in certain data structures for some Intel(R) Processors with Intel(R) Processor Graphics may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
