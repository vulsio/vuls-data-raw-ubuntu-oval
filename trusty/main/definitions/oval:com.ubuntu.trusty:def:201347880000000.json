    "Title": "CVE-2013-4788 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The PTR_MANGLE implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.4, 2.17, and earlier, and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) does not initialize the random value for the pointer guard, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to control execution flow by leveraging a buffer-overflow vulnerability in an application and using the known zero value pointer guard to calculate a pointer address.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2013-4788` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\neglibc-source - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc-bin - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-amd64 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-armel - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-i386 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-pic - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-ppc64 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-prof - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-x32 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-xen - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nmultiarch-support - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nnscd - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
