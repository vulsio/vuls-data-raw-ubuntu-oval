		"Description": "In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, shiftfs_btrfs_ioctl_fd_replace() callsfdget(oldfd), then without further checks passes the resulting file* intoshiftfs_real_fdget(), which casts file->private_data, a void* that pointsto a filesystem-dependent type, to a \"struct shiftfs_file_info *\". As theprivate_data is not required to be a pointer, an attacker can use this tocause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
