    "Title": "CVE-2020-28915 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A buffer over-read (at the framebuffer layer) in the fbcon code in the Linux kernel before 5.8.15 could be used by local attackers to read kernel memory, aka CID-6735b4632def. It was discovered that the framebuffer implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform range checks in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
