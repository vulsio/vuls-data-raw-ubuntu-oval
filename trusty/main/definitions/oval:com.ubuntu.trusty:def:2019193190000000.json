    "Title": "CVE-2019-19319 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.2, a setxattr operation, after a mount of a crafted ext4 image, can cause a slab-out-of-bounds write access because of an ext4_xattr_set_entry use-after-free in fs/ext4/xattr.c when a large old_size value is used in a memset call, aka CID-345c0dbf3a30. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle setxattr operations in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
