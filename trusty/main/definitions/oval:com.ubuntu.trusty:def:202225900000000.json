    "Title": "CVE-2022-2590 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only shared memory mappings. This flaw allows an unprivileged, local user to gain write access to read-only memory mappings, increasing their privileges on the system. David Hildenbrand discovered that a race condition existed in the memory manager of the Linux kernel when handling copy-on-write with shared memory pages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
