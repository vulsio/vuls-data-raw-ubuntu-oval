		"Title": "CVE-2018-0739 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2n).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-0739` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.24\nopenssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.24\nNo subscription required",
