		"Title": "CVE-2021-27365 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. Certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. An unprivileged user can send a Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to the maximum length of a Netlink message. Adam Nichols discovered that heap overflows existed in the iSCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
