    "Title": "CVE-2020-11494 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in slc_bump in drivers/net/can/slcan.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.6.2. It allows attackers to read uninitialized can_frame data, potentially containing sensitive information from kernel stack memory, if the configuration lacks CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL, aka CID-b9258a2cece4. It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
