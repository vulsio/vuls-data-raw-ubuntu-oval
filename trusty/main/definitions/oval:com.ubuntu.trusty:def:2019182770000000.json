		"description": "A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messagesfeaturing a transfer-encoding header missing the \"chunked\" value were notbeing correctly rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with the\"http-reuse always\" setting, it could be used to help construct an HTTPrequest smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenientparser that would ignore the content-length header as soon as it saw atransfer-encoding one (even if not entirely valid according to thespecification).",
