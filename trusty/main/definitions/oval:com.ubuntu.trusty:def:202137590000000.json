		"Title": "CVE-2021-3759 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A memory overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s ipc functionality of the memcg subsystem, in the way a user calls the semget function multiple times, creating semaphores. This flaw allows a local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly account for the memory usage of certain IPC objects. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
