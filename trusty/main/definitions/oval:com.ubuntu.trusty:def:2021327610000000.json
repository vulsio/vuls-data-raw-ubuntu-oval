		"description": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerabilityinvolving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow existsstarting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5.On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflowthat can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heapcontents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involveschanging the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a verylarge value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. Thisproblem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bitbinary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for thisissue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patchingthe `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the`proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL torestrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.",
