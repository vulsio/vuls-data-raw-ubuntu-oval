		"Description": "It was found that the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kpatch update did notinclude the complete fix for CVE-2018-12207. A flaw was found in the wayIntel CPUs handle inconsistency between, virtual to physical memory addresstranslations in CPU's local cache and system software's Paging structureentries. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to induce a hardwareMachine Check Error on the host processor, resulting in a severe DoSscenario by halting the processor. System software like OS OR VirtualMachine Monitor (VMM) use virtual memory system for storing programinstructions and data in memory. Virtual Memory system uses Pagingstructures like Page Tables and Page Directories to manage system memory.The processor's Memory Management Unit (MMU) uses Paging structure entriesto translate program's virtual memory addresses to physical memoryaddresses. The processor stores these address translations into its localcache buffer called - Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). TLB has twoparts, one for instructions and other for data addresses. System softwarecan modify its Paging structure entries to change address mappings ORcertain attributes like page size etc. Upon such Paging structurealterations in memory, system software must invalidate the correspondingaddress translations in the processor's TLB cache. But before this TLBinvalidation takes place, a privileged guest user may trigger aninstruction fetch operation, which could use an already cached, but nowinvalid, virtual to physical address translation from Instruction TLB(ITLB). Thus accessing an invalid physical memory address and resulting inhalting the processor due to the Machine Check Error (MCE) on Page SizeChange.",
