    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.9. drivers/vhost/vdpa.c has a use-after-free because v->config_ctx has an invalid value upon re-opening a character device, aka CID-f6bbf0010ba0. It was discovered that the vDPA backend virtio driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
