    "Title": "CVE-2022-45919 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
