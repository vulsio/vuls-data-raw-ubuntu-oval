    "Title": "CVE-2020-12659 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.7. xdp_umem_reg in net/xdp/xdp_umem.c has an out-of-bounds write (by a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) because of a lack of headroom validation. Bui Quang Minh discovered that the XDP socket implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data passed from user space, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
