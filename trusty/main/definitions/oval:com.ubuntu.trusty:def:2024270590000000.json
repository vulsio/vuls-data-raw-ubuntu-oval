		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_commandThe isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS valuesin the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values whencreating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.  The calculation involvesdivision and modulus operations, which will cause a crash if either ofthese values is 0.  While this never happens with a genuine device, itcould happen with a flawed or subversive emulation, as reported by thesyzbot fuzzer.Protect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device ifeither the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's IDinformation is 0.  This requires isd200_Initialization() to return anegative error code when initialization fails; currently it alwaysreturns 0 (even when there is an error).",
