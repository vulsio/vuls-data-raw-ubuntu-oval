		"Title": "CVE-2020-35519 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in net/x25/af_x25.c in the Linux kernel version v5.12-rc5. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the x25 implementation in the Linux kernel contained overflows when handling addresses from user space. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
