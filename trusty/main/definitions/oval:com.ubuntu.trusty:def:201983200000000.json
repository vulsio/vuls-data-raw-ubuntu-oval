		"description": "A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.7.6 and laterthrough 3.0.2. Before making new directories or touching files (which nowinclude path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the targetdestination. If that destination was hidden behind a symlink, a maliciousgem could delete arbitrary files on the user's machine, presuming theattacker could guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, andhow predictable paths are on modern systems (/tmp, /usr, etc.), this couldlikely lead to data loss or an unusable system.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-8320` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nlibtcltk-ruby1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nri1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.1-examples - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.1-full - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.3 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlibruby2.0 - 2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.13\nruby2.0 - 2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.13\nruby2.0-tcltk - 2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.13\nNo subscription required",
