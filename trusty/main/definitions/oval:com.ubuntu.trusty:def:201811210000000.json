		"title": "CVE-2018-1121 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low",
		"description": "procps-ng, procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition.Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascendingnumeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events todetermine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain alower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide aprocess from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition inreading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ngup to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.",
