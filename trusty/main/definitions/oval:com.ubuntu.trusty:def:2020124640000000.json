		"Title": "CVE-2020-12464 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "usb_sg_cancel in drivers/usb/core/message.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6.8 has a use-after-free because a transfer occurs without a reference, aka CID-056ad39ee925. It was discovered that the USB susbsystem's scatter-gather implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly take data references in some situations, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
