		"title": "CVE-2017-1000112 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high",
		"description": "Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO pathswitch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() callsip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send() calls, theappend path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to amemory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy =maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branchto allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computationof fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causingcopy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequentlyskb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is presentin IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in e89e9cf539a2 (\"[IPv4/IPv6]: UFOScatter-gather approach\") on Oct 18 2005.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000112` to fix the vulnerability.
