    "Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service. It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
