    "Title": "CVE-2016-8616 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection, curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing connections. This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-8616` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nlibcurl3 - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.10\nNo subscription required",
