    "Title": "CVE-2022-27223 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In drivers/usb/gadget/udc/udc-xilinx.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12, the endpoint index is not validated and might be manipulated by the host for out-of-array access. It was discovered that the Xilinx USB2 device gadget driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint indices from the host. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
