		"Note": "mdeslaur> This is an Android CVE, as of 2022-09-16, there is no indication what the issue is, what the fix is, and if the issue affects the libnl3 package in Ubuntu. ccdm94> Looking at the libnl3 code and at the CVE description, a few of the mentioned functions, types and variables can be found: function 'nla_parse' does exist, and 'nla_type' exists as well. The 'policy[type]' access is also done. However, there seems to be no variable called 'para'. Therefore, looking only at the CVE description and at the only advisory made available by Android, it is not possible to determine, as of 2022-10-11, if libnl3 is vulnerable in any Ubuntu release. Upstream also has not released any commits that seems to be related to this issue, and, therefore, no current fix for libnl3 is avaiable if it is vulnerable. mdeslaur> no indication this affects Ubuntu, marking as not-affected"
