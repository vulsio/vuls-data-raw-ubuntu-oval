		"Title": "CVE-2021-28971 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8 on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled, aka CID-d88d05a9e0b6. Vince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell processors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
