    "Title": "CVE-2021-3743 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory read flaw was found in the Qualcomm IPC router protocol in the Linux kernel. A missing sanity check allows a local attacker to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.",
