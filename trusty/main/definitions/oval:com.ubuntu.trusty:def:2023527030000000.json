Jiri Pirko noted that it'spointless to pass it in the error path, and that the value that would beprinted in the second error path would be the value of act_len from thefirst call to usb_bulk_msg.[1] With this in mind, let's just not passact_len to the usb_bulk_msg error paths. 1:https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Y9pY61y1nwTuzMOa@nanopsycho/",
