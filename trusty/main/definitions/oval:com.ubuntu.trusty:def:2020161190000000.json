		"Title": "CVE-2020-16119 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel exploitable by a local attacker due to reuse of a DCCP socket with an attached dccps_hc_tx_ccid object as a listener after being released. Fixed in Ubuntu Linux kernel 5.4.0-51.56, 5.3.0-68.63, 4.15.0-121.123, 4.4.0-193.224, 3.13.0.182.191 and 3.2.0-149.196. Hadar Manor discovered that the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled socket reuse, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
