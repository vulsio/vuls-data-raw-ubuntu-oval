    "Title": "CVE-2023-3610 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Flaw in the error handling of bound chains causes a use-after-free in the abort path of NFT_MSG_NEWRULE. The vulnerability requires CAP_NET_ADMIN to be triggered. We recommend upgrading past commit 4bedf9eee016286c835e3d8fa981ddece5338795. It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
