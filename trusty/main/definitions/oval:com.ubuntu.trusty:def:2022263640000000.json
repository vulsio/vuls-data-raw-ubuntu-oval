		"Description": "x86 pv: Insufficient care with non-coherent mappings T[his CNA informationrecord relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains whichaspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen maintains a typereference count for pages, in addition to a regular reference count. Thisscheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety, e.g. PVguests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables; updates needauditing by Xen. Unfortunately, Xen's safety logic doesn't account forCPU-induced cache non-coherency; cases where the CPU can cause the contentof the cache to be different to the content in main memory. In such cases,Xen's safety logic can incorrectly conclude that the contents of a page issafe.",
