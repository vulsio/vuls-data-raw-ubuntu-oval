		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:leds: trigger: netdev: Fix kernel panic on interface rename trig notifyCommit d5e01266e7f5 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: add additional specific linkspeed mode\") in the various changes, reworked the way to set the LINKUPmode in commit cee4bd16c319 (\"leds: trigger: netdev: RecheckNETDEV_LED_MODE_LINKUP on dev rename\") and moved it to a generic function.This changed the logic where, in the previous implementation the devfrom the trigger event was used to check if the carrier was ok, but inthe new implementation with the generic function, the dev intrigger_data is used instead.This is problematic and cause a possible kernel panic due to the factthat the dev in the trigger_data still reference the old one as thenew one (passed from the trigger event) still has to be hold and savedin the trigger_data struct (done in the NETDEV_REGISTER case).On calling of get_device_state(), an invalid net_dev is used and thiscause a kernel panic.To handle this correctly, move the call to get_device_state() after thenew net_dev is correctly set in trigger_data (in the NETDEV_REGISTERcase) and correctly parse the new dev.",
