		"description": "** DISPUTED ** Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to rootif they have write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. Thisoccurs because of a race condition between determining a uid, and thesetresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write \"ALL ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:ALL\" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for apassword. NOTE: This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. Ithas been argued that writing to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable ifyou had permission to write to /etc/sudoers. Even with write permission to/proc/#####/fd/3, it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers.",
