		"Description": "Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. Incrossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectlyassumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as thenumber of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guaranteethat and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channelreconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumesdescribed above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with theincorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes withthe number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel0.4.4.",
