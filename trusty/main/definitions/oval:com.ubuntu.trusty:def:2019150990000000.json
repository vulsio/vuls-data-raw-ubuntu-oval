    "Description": "drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.8 has a NULL pointer dereference via an incomplete address in an endpoint descriptor. It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
