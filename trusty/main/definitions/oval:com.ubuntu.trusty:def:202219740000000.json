		"Title": "CVE-2022-1974 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFC core functionality due to a race condition between kobject creation and delete. This vulnerability allows a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege to leak kernel information. Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
