		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfsd:fix use-after-free due to delegation race A delegation break could arriveas soon as we've called vfs_setlease. A delegation break runs a callbackwhich immediately (in nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation todel_recall_lru. If we then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing thedelegation, it will be freed as soon as the callback is done with it,without ever being removed from del_recall_lru. Symptoms show up later asuse-after-free or list corruption warnings, usually in the laundromatthread. I suspect aba2072f4523 \"nfsd: grant read delegations to clientsholding writes\" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back asv3.0 and it looks to me it already had the same problem. So I'm not surewhere the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.",
