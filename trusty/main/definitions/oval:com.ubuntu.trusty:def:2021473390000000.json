		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input data As seen from a recent syzbotbug report, mistakes in the compat ioctl implementation can lead touninitialized kernel stack data getting used as input for driver ioctlhandlers. The reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that otherrelated bugs are still present or get added in the future. As the driversneed to check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but itmight still cause an information leak. To be on the safe side, always clearthe entire ioctl buffer before calling the conversion handler functionsthat are meant to initialize them.",
