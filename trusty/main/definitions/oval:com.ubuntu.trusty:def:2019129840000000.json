		"Title": "CVE-2019-12984 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the function nfc_genl_deactivate_target() in net/nfc/netlink.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.13 can be triggered by a malicious user-mode program that omits certain NFC attributes, leading to denial of service. It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
