		"Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenJPEG 2.3.0. Missing checks for header_info.height and header_info.width in the function pnmtoimage in bin/jpwl/convert.c can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain PNM files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",

Before the refactoring, there was a single convert.c file, which according to the code, seems to be affected by this vulnerability, however, it seems like the vulnerability in this case is related to CVE-2016-9118 instead, which has a very similar patch."
