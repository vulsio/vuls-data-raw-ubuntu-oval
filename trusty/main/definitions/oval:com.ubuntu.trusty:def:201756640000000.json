		"title": "CVE-2017-5664 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that,when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error thatoccurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the errorpage. This means that the request is presented to the error page with theoriginal HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expectedbehaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request,regardless of the actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0 to 8.5.14, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to7.0.77 did not do this. Depending on the original request this could leadto unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including, ifthe DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement orremoval of the custom error page. Notes for other user provided errorpages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method.JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any errordispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method. (2) By default,the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the HTTP method. CustomServlets used as error pages must ensure that they handle any errordispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5664` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibservlet3.0-java - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.13\nlibtomcat7-java - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.13\ntomcat7 - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.13\ntomcat7-admin - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.13\ntomcat7-common - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.13\ntomcat7-examples - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.13\ntomcat7-user - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.13\nNo subscription required",
