    "Title": "CVE-2021-31916 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel before 5.12. A bound check failure allows an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
