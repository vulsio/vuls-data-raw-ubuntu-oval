		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:watchdog: Fix possible use-after-free by calling del_timer_sync() Thisdriver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function does notwait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the timer handlermay still be running after the driver's remove function has finished, whichwould result in a use-after-free. Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), whichmakes sure the timer handler has finished, and unable to re-scheduleitself.",
