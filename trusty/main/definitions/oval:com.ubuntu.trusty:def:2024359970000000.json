		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: HID:i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up The flagI2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations. However, this isnot necessary, because I2C core already has its own locking for that. Moreimportantly, this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set ini2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens, the interrupt handler(i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doinganything, then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an infiniteloop. Since interrupt handler is an RT task, it takes over the CPU and theflag-clearing task never gets scheduled, thus we have a lock-up. Deletethis unnecessary flag.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35997` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-257-generic - 4.4.0-257.291~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-257-generic - 4.4.0-257.291~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-257-lowlatency - 4.4.0-257.291~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1134-aws - 4.4.0-1134.140\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1179-azure - 4.15.0-1179.194~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
