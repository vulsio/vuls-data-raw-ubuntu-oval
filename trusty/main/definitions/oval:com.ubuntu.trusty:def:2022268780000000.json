		"Title": "CVE-2022-26878 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "drivers/bluetooth/virtio_bt.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.3 has a memory leak (socket buffers have memory allocated but not freed). It was discovered that the VirtIO Bluetooth driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
