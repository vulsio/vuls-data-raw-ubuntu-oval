    "Title": "CVE-2019-18660 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before 5.4.1 on powerpc allows Information Exposure because the Spectre-RSB mitigation is not in place for all applicable CPUs, aka CID-39e72bf96f58. This is related to arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_64.S and arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c. Anthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture systems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
