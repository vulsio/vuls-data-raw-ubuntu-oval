		"Title": "CVE-2019-3901 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "A race condition in perf_event_open() allows local attackers to leaksensitive data from setuid programs. As no relevant locks (in particularthe cred_guard_mutex) are held during the ptrace_may_access() call, it ispossible for the specified target task to perform an execve() syscall withsetuid execution before perf_event_alloc() actually attaches to it,allowing an attacker to bypass the ptrace_may_access() check and theperf_event_exit_task(current) call that is performed ininstall_exec_creds() during privileged execve() calls. This issue affectskernel versions before 4.8.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3901` to fix the vulnerability.
