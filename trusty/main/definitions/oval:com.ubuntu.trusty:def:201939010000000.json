		"Title": "CVE-2019-3901 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A race condition in perf_event_open() allows local attackers to leak sensitive data from setuid programs. As no relevant locks (in particular the cred_guard_mutex) are held during the ptrace_may_access() call, it is possible for the specified target task to perform an execve() syscall with setuid execution before perf_event_alloc() actually attaches to it, allowing an attacker to bypass the ptrace_may_access() check and the perf_event_exit_task(current) call that is performed in install_exec_creds() during privileged execve() calls. This issue affects kernel versions before 4.8.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3901` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-generic - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-lowlatency - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-28-generic - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-generic - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-lowlatency - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-28-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-28-generic - 4.4.0-28.47~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
