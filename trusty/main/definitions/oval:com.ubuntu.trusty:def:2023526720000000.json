		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pipe:wakeup wr_wait after setting max_usage Commit c73be61cede5 (\"pipe: Addgeneral notification queue support\") a regression was introduced that wouldlock up resized pipes under certain conditions. See the reproducer in [1].The commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a different function,doing that moved the wakeup for pipe->wr_wait before actually raisingpipe->max_usage. If a pipe was full before the resize occured it wouldresult in the wakeup never actually triggering pipe_write. Set @max_usageand @nr_accounted before waking writers if this isn't a watch queue.[Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>: rewrite to account for watchqueues]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52672` to fix the vulnerability.
