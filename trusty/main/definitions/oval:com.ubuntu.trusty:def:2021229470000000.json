		"Title": "CVE-2021-22947 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server toretrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server canrespond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curlwould then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responsesbut instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* theTLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows aMan-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, thenpass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl intosending data back to the user thinking the attacker's injected data comesfrom the TLS-protected server.",
