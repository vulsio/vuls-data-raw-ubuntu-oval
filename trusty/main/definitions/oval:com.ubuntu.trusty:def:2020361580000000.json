		"Description": "mwifiex_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/join.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.4 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long SSID value, aka CID-5c455c5ab332. It was discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate ad-hoc SSIDs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
