		"Title": "CVE-2021-33200 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.7 enforces incorrect limits for pointer arithmetic operations, aka CID-bb01a1bba579. This can be abused to perform out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory, leading to local privilege escalation to root. In particular, there is a corner case where the off reg causes a masking direction change, which then results in an incorrect final aux->alu_limit. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce limits for pointer operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
