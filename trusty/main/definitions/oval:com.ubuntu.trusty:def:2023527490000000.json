		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: Fix null dereference on suspendA race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can beactive during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointerdereference exception to occur when the system resumes.Example order of events leading to the exception:1. spi_sync() calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets   ctlr->cur_msg2. Spi transfer begins via spi_transfer_one_message()3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context4. System is resumed6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg   to NULL7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is   called which dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)Wait for synchronous transfers to complete before suspending byacquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspend flag.",
