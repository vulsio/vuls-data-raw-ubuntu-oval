    "Title": "CVE-2018-10938 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel present since v4.0-rc1 and through v4.13-rc4. A crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter an infinite loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading to a denial-of-service. A certain non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security Module) and NetLabel should be set up on a system before an attacker could leverage this flaw. Yves Younan discovered that the CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A remote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that could cause a denial of service (infinite loop).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10938` to fix the vulnerability.
