		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mac80211: improve CSA/ECSA connection refusalAs mentioned in the previous commit, we pretty quickly foundthat some APs have ECSA elements stuck in their probe response,so using that to not attempt to connect while CSA is happeningwe never connect to such an AP.Improve this situation by checking more carefully and ignoringthe ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA elementbeing stuck in the probe response.Additionally, allow connecting to an AP that's switching to achannel it's already using, unless it's using quiet mode. Inthis case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it'sactually switching channels, it's better not to try to connectin the middle of that.",
