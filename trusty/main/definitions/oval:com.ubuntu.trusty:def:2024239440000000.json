		"description": "Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeperdue to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes byattaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which theattacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check whenthe persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path ofznodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner ofthe watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by thisvulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can containsensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentiallycritical. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 whichfixes the issue.",
