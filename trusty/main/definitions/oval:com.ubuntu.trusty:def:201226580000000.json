NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability,since the ability to set this option typically implies that the attackeralready has legitimate access to cause a DoS or execute code, and thereforethe issue would not cross privilege boundaries. There may be limited attackscenarios if isql command-line options are exposed to an attacker, althoughit seems likely that other, more serious issues would also be exposed, andthis issue might not cross privilege boundaries in that context.",
