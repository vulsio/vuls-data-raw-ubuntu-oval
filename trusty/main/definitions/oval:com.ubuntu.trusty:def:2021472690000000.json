		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exceptionThere is no validation of the index from dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we mightbe referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. Incertain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wronglyindicate a larger ep index than existing.By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrongindex back to the caller.In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, butupstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe thehardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietaryimplementation.[   82.958261] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtualaddress 00000000000000a4[   82.966891] Mem abort info:[   82.969663]   ESR = 0x96000006[   82.972703]   Exception class = DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits[   82.978603]   SET = 0, FnV = 0[   82.981642]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0[   82.984765] Data abort info:[   82.987631]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000006[   82.991449]   CM = 0, WnR = 0[   82.994409] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp = 00000000c6210ccc[   83.000999] [00000000000000a4] pgd=0000000053aa5003,pud=0000000053aa5003, pmd=0000000000000000[   83.009685] Internal error: Oops: 96000006 [#1] PREEMPT SMP[   83.026433] Process irq/62-dwc3 (pid: 303, stack limit =0x000000003985154c)[   83.033470] CPU: 0 PID: 303 Comm: irq/62-dwc3 Not tainted 4.19.124 #1[   83.044836] pstate: 60000085 (nZCv daIf -PAN -UAO)[   83.049628] pc : dwc3_ep0_handle_feature+0x414/0x43c[   83.054558] lr : dwc3_ep0_interrupt+0x3b4/0xc94...[   83.141788] Call trace:[   83.144227]  dwc3_ep0_handle_feature+0x414/0x43c[   83.148823]  dwc3_ep0_interrupt+0x3b4/0xc94[   83.181546] ---[ end trace aac6b5267d84c32f ]---",
