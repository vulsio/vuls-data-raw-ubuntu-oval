		"Title": "CVE-2016-8636 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Integer overflow in the mem_check_range function in drivers/infiniband/sw/rxe/rxe_mr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.10 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, or possibly have unspecified other impact via a write or read request involving the \"RDMA protocol over infiniband\" (aka Soft RoCE) technology. It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the InfiniBand RDMA over ethernet (RXE) transport implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-8636` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
