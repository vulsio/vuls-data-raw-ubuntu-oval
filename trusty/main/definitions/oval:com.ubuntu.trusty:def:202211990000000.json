    "Title": "CVE-2022-1199 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the Linux kernel by simulating amateur radio from the user space, resulting in a null-ptr-deref vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability. Duoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
