		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ax25: Fix reference count leak issue of net_deviceThere is a reference count leak issue of the object \"net_device\" inax25_dev_device_down(). When the ax25 device is shutting down, theax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device oneor zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which willcause memory leak.In order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count ofnet_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38554` to fix the vulnerability.
