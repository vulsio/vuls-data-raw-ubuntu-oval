		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/scsi/qedi/qedi_dbg.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.12. In the qedi_dbg_* family of functions, there is an out-of-bounds read. It was discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the QLogic QEDI iSCSI Initiator Driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
