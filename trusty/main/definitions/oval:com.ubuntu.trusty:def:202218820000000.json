    "Title": "CVE-2022-1882 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s pipes functionality in how a user performs manipulations with the pipe post_one_notification() after free_pipe_info() that is already called. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Selim Enes Karaduman discovered that a race condition existed in the General notification queue implementation of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
