		"Description": "A carefully crafted request on AJAXPreview.jsp could trigger an XSSvulnerability on Apache JSPWiki, which could allow the attacker to executejavascript in the victim's browser and get some sensitive information aboutthe victim. This vulnerability leverages CVE-2021-40369, where the Denounceplugin dangerously renders user-supplied URLs. Upon re-testingCVE-2021-40369, it appears that the patch was incomplete as it was stillpossible to insert malicious input via the Denounce plugin. Apache JSPWikiusers should upgrade to 2.11.3 or later.",
