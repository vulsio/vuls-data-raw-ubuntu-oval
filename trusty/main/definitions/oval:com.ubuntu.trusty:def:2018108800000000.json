    "Title": "CVE-2018-10880 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "Linux kernel is vulnerable to a stack-out-of-bounds write in the ext4 filesystem code when mounting and writing to a crafted ext4 image in ext4_update_inline_data(). An attacker could use this to cause a system crash and a denial of service. Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10880` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1034-aws - 4.4.0-1034.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-lowlatency - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-lowlatency - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
