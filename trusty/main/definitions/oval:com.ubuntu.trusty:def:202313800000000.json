		"Title": "CVE-2023-1380 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "A slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service. It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
