		"Title": "CVE-2020-10135 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in Bluetooth BR/EDR Core Specification v5.2 and earlier may allow an unauthenticated user to complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could impersonate a Bluetooth BR/EDR master or slave to pair with a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure without knowing the link key. Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen discovered that legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in the Bluetooth protocol could allow an unauthenticated user to complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. A physically proximate attacker could use this to impersonate a previously paired Bluetooth device.",
