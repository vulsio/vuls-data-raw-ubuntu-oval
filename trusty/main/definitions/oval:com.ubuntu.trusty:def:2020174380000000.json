		"description": "An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and otherproducts. The code that reassembles fragmented packets fails to properlyvalidate the total length of an incoming packet specified in its IP header,as well as the fragmentation offset value specified in the IP header. Bycrafting a packet with specific values of the IP header length and thefragmentation offset, attackers can write into the .bss section of theprogram (past the statically allocated buffer that is used for storing thefragmented data) and cause a denial of service in uip_reass() in uip.c, orpossibly execute arbitrary code on some target architectures.",
