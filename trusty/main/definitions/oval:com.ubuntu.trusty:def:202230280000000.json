		"Title": "CVE-2022-3028 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket. Abhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
