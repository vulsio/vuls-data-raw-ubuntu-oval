		"Title": "CVE-2019-9854 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installedmacros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over,document-open etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under theshare/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories of theLibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9852, toavoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations onthe file system could be executed by employing a URL encoding attack todefeat the path verification step. However this protection could bebypassed by taking advantage of a flaw in how LibreOffice assembled thefinal script URL location directly from components of the passed in path asopposed to solely from the sanitized output of the path verification step.This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.",
