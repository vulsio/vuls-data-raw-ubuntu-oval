		"Title": "CVE-2023-28322 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low",
		"Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doingHTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback(`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the`CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previouslywasused to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw maysurprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off thewrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. Theproblem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is (expected to be)changed from a PUT to a POST.",
