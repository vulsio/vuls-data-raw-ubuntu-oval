		"description": "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk fromversion 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFSfilesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extractfiles at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-eoption). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystemthat, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into thefolder .config/binwalk/plugins. This vulnerability is associated withprogram files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py. This issue affects binwalk from2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.",
