		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopyA failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry inthe file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. Thisenables userland to refer to a dangling 'file' object through that stillvalid file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-freeexploitation scenarios.Fix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopyhas succeeded.",
