    "Title": "CVE-2021-3772 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. It was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify VTAGs in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (connection disassociation).",
