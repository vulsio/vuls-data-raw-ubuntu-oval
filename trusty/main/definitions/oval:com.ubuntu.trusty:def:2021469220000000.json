		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unsealThe original patch 8c657a0590de (\"KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for sealand unseal operations\") was correct on the mailing list:https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() intpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of theTPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()",
