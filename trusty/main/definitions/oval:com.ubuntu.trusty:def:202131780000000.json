		"Title": "CVE-2021-3178 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.10.8, when there is an NFS export of a subdirectory of a filesystem, allows remote attackers to traverse to other parts of the filesystem via READDIRPLUS. NOTE: some parties argue that such a subdirectory export is not intended to prevent this attack; see also the exports(5) no_subtree_check default behavior. 吴异 discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent access outside of an NFS export that is a subdirectory of a file system. An attacker could possibly use this to bypass NFS access restrictions.",
