		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback testThe ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference whenperforming the ethtool loopback test. This is due to the fact that thereisn't a q_vector associated with the test ring when it is setup asinterrupts are not normally added to the test rings.To address this I have added code that will check for a q_vector beforereturning a napi_id value. If a q_vector is not present it will return avalue of 0.",
