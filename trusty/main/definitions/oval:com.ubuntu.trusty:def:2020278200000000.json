		"Title": "CVE-2020-27820 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel, where a use-after-frees in nouveau's postclose() handler could happen if removing device (that is not common to remove video card physically without power-off, but same happens if \"unbind\" the driver). Jeremy Cline discovered a use-after-free in the nouveau graphics driver of the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged or physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
