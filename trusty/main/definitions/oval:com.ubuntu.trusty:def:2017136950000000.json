    "Title": "CVE-2017-13695 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "The acpi_ns_evaluate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nseval.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table. Seunghun Han discovered an information leak in the ACPI handling code in the Linux kernel when handling early termination of ACPI table loading. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive informal (kernel address locations).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-13695` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1024-aws - 4.4.0-1024.25\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-generic - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-lowlatency - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-130-generic - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-generic - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-lowlatency - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-130-generic - 4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
