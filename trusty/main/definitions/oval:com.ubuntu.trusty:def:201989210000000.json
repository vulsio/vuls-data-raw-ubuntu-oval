		"description": "An issue was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through 5.48. Thevulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDPimplementation. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick theserver into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resultingin leaking arbitrary heap data. The root cause can be found in the functionservice_attr_req of sdpd-request.c. The server does not check whether theCSTATE data is the same in consecutive requests, and instead simply truststhat it is the same.",
