		"Title": "CVE-2022-1852 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s KVM module, which can lead to a denial of service in the x86_emulate_insn in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. This flaw occurs while executing an illegal instruction in guest in the Intel CPU. Qiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle an illegal instruction in a guest, resulting in a null pointer dereference. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.",
