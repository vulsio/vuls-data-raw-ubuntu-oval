		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again(struct dirty_throttle_control *)->thresh is an unsigned long, but ispassed as the u32 divisor argument to div_u64().  On architectures whereunsigned long is 64 bytes, the argument will be implicitly truncated.Use div64_u64() instead of div_u64() so that the value used in the \"isthis a safe division\" check is the same as the divisor.Also, remove redundant cast of the numerator to u64, as that should happenimplicitly.This would be difficult to exploit in memcg domain, given the ratio-basedarithmetic domain_drity_limits() uses, but is much easier in globalwriteback domain with a BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT-backing device, using e.g.vm.dirty_bytes=(1<<32)*PAGE_SIZE so that dtc->thresh == (1<<32)",
