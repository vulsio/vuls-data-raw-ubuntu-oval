		"Title": "CVE-2023-21264 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "In multiple functions of mem_protect.c, there is a possible way to access hypervisor memory due to a memory access check in the wrong place. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. It was discovered that the ARM64 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict hypervisor memory access. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to execute arbitrary code in the host OS.",
