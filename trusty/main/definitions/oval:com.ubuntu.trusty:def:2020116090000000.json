		"Title": "CVE-2020-11609 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the stv06xx subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.6.1. drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx.c and drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx_pb0100.c mishandle invalid descriptors, as demonstrated by a NULL pointer dereference, aka CID-485b06aadb93. It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
