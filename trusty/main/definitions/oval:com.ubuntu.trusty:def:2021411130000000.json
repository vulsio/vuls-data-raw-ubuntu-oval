In a worst case scenario, the attacker could create anew admin user account to compromise the system. To successfully carry outan attack, an attacker must trick his victim to access a compromisedsystem. The victim must have an active session in the TYPO3 backend at thattime. The following Same-Site cookie settings in$GLOBALS[TYPO3_CONF_VARS][BE][cookieSameSite] are required for an attack tobe successful: SameSite=strict: malicious evil.example.org invoking TYPO3application at good.example.org and SameSite=lax or none: maliciousevil.com invoking TYPO3 application at example.org. Update your instance toTYPO3 version 11.5.0 which addresses the problem described.",
