		"Title": "CVE-2022-48425 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 6.2.7, fs/ntfs3/inode.c has an invalid kfree because it does not validate MFT flags before replaying logs. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate MFT flags in certain situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious NTFS image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
