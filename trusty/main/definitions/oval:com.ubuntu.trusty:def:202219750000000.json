		"Title": "CVE-2022-1975 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "There is a sleep-in-atomic bug in /net/nfc/netlink.c that allows an attacker to crash the Linux kernel by simulating a nfc device from user-space. Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic context operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
