		"Title": "CVE-2017-5577 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "The vc4_get_bcl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/vc4_gem.c in the VideoCore DRM driver in the Linux kernel before 4.9.7 does not set an errno value upon certain overflow detections, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and OOPS) via inconsistent size values in a VC4_SUBMIT_CL ioctl call. Ingo Molnar discovered that the VideoCore DRM driver in the Linux kernel did not return an error after detecting certain overflows. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service (OOPS).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5577` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
