		"Title": "CVE-2023-2269 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-component. Zheng Zhang discovered that the device-mapper implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking during table_clear() operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).",
