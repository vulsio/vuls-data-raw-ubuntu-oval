		"Title": "CVE-2019-11487 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "The Linux kernel before 5.1-rc5 allows page->_refcount reference count overflow, with resultant use-after-free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c, include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c, mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c. It can occur with FUSE requests. It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when reference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
