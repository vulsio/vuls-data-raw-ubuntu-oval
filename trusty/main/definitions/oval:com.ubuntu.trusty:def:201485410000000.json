    "Title": "CVE-2014-8541 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "libavcodec/mjpegdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.4.2 considers only dimension differences, and not bits-per-pixel differences, when determining whether an image size has changed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted MJPEG data. It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain media files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
