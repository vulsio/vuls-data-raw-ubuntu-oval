		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rcu: Fix buffer overflow in print_cpu_stall_info()The rcuc-starvation output from print_cpu_stall_info() might overflow thebuffer if there is a huge difference in jiffies difference.  The situationmight seem improbable, but computers sometimes get very confused abouttime, which can result in full-sized integers, and, in this case,buffer overflow.Also, the unsigned jiffies difference is printed using %ld, which isnormally for signed integers.  This is intentional for debugging purposes,but it is not obvious from the code.This commit therefore changes sprintf() to snprintf() and adds aclarifying comment about intention of %ld format.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
