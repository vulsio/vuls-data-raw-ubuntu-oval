    "Title": "CVE-2017-5550 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Off-by-one error in the pipe_advance function in lib/iov_iter.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized heap-memory locations in opportunistic circumstances by reading from a pipe after an incorrect buffer-release decision. It was discovered that a fencepost error existed in the pipe_advance() function in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5550` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
