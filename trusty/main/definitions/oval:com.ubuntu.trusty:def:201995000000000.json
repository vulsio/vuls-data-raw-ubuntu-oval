		"description": "The Broadcom brcmfmac WiFi driver prior to commit1b5e2423164b3670e8bc9174e4762d297990deff is vulnerable to a heap bufferoverflow. If the Wake-up on Wireless LAN functionality is configured, amalicious event frame can be constructed to trigger an heap buffer overflowin the brcmf_wowl_nd_results function. This vulnerability can be exploitedwith compromised chipsets to compromise the host, or when used incombination with CVE-2019-9503, can be used remotely. In the worst casescenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote,unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on avulnerable system.
