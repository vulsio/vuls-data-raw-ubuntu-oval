    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernelâ€™s filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
