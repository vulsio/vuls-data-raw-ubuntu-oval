		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/secretmem: fix GUP-fast succeeding on secretmem foliosfolio_is_secretmem() currently relies on secretmem folios being LRUfolios, to save some cycles.However, folios might reside in a folio batch without the LRU flag set, ortemporarily have their LRU flag cleared.  Consequently, the LRU flag isunreliable for this purpose.In particular, this is the case when secretmem_fault() allocates a freshpage and calls filemap_add_folio()->folio_add_lru().  The folio might beadded to the per-cpu folio batch and won't get the LRU flag set until thebatch was drained using e.g., lru_add_drain().Consequently, folio_is_secretmem() might not detect secretmem folios andGUP-fast can succeed in grabbing a secretmem folio, crashing the kernelwhen we would later try reading/writing to the folio, because the foliohas been unmapped from the directmap.Fix it by removing that unreliable check.",
