		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:userfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit_mmap() A race ispossible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by exit_mmap() and atthe same time userfaultfd_writeprotect() is called. The race was detectedby KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears to be possible on vanillakernels as well. Use mmget_not_zero() to prevent the race as done in otheruserfaultfd operations.",
