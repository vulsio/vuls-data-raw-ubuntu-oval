		"description": "All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.xbefore 4.11.3 have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegationmodel includes a feature allowing for a subset of clients to be opted outof constrained delegation in any way, either S4U2Self or regular Kerberosauthentication, by forcing all tickets for these clients to benon-forwardable. In AD this is implemented by a user attributedelegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which translates todisallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Selfand does set the forwardable flag even if the impersonated client has thenot-delegated flag set.",
