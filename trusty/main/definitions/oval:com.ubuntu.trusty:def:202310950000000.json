		"Title": "CVE-2023-1095 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference. Mingi Cho discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a data structure, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
