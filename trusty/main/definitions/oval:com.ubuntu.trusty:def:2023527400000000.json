		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix interrupt exit race with security mitigationswitchThe RFI and STF security mitigation options can flip theinterrupt_exit_not_reentrant static branch condition concurrently withthe interrupt exit code which tests that branch.Interrupt exit tests this condition to set MSR[EE|RI] for exit, thenagain in the case a soft-masked interrupt is found pending, to recoverthe MSR so the interrupt can be replayed before attempting to exitagain. If the condition changes between these two tests, the MSR and irqsoft-mask state will become corrupted, leading to warnings and possiblecrashes. For example, if the branch is initially true then false,MSR[EE] will be 0 but PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS clear and EE may not getenabled, leading to warnings in irq_64.c.",
