		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_devicehandlingMove the freeing of the dummy net_device from mtk_free_dev() tomtk_remove().Previously, if alloc_netdev_dummy() failed in mtk_probe(),eth->dummy_dev would be NULL. The error path would then callmtk_free_dev(), which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_devwas allocated (but it was not), potentially causing a NULL pointerdereference.By moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove(), we ensure it's only called whenmtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated. Thisaddresses a potential NULL pointer dereference detected by Smatch[1].",
