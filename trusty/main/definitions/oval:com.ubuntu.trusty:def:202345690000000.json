		"Title": "CVE-2023-4569 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in nft_set_catchall_flush in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to cause double-deactivations of catchall elements, which can result in a memory leak. Lonial Con discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain element flush operations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
