    "Title": "CVE-2014-6060 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The get_option function in dhcpcd 4.0.0 through 6.x before 6.4.3 allows remote DHCP servers to cause a denial of service by resetting the DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED option in the (1) bootfile or (2) servername section, which triggers the option to be processed again. It was discovered that dhcpcd incorrectly handled DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED option. An attaacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-6060` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndhcpcd5 - 6.0.5-2build0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
