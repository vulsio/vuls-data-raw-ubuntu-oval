		"Title": "CVE-2019-19578 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OSusers to cause a denial of service via degenerate chains of linearpagetables, because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-15595. \"Linearpagetables\" is a technique which involves either pointing a pagetable atitself, or to another pagetable of the same or higher level. Xen haslimited support for linear pagetables: A page may either point to itself,or point to another pagetable of the same level (i.e., L2 to L2, L3 to L3,and so on). XSA-240 introduced an additional restriction that limited the\"depth\" of such chains by allowing pages to either *point to* other pagesof the same level, or *be pointed to* by other pages of the same level, butnot both. To implement this, we keep track of the number of outstandingtimes a page points to or is pointed to another page table, to prevent bothfrom happening at the same time. Unfortunately, the original commitintroducing this reset this count when resuming validation of apartially-validated pagetable, incorrectly dropping some \"linear_pt_entry\"counts. If an attacker could engineer such a situation to occur, they mightbe able to make loops or other arbitrary chains of linear pagetables, asdescribed in XSA-240. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause thehypervisor to crash, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting theentire host. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded.All versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Armsystems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage thevulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.Only systems which have enabled linear pagetables are vulnerable. Systemswhich have disabled linear pagetables, either by selectingCONFIG_PV_LINEAR_PT=n when building the hypervisor, or addingpv-linear-pt=false on the command-line, are not vulnerable.",
