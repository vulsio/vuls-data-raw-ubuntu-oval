    "Title": "CVE-2018-12904 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.2, when nested virtualization is used, local attackers could cause L1 KVM guests to VMEXIT, potentially allowing privilege escalations and denial of service attacks due to lack of checking of CPL. Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to escape into an outer VM or the host OS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-12904` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
