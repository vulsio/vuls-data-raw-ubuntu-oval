    "Title": "CVE-2022-1789 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "With shadow paging enabled, the INVPCID instruction results in a call to kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva. If INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0, the invlpg callback is not set and the result is a NULL pointer dereference. Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.",
