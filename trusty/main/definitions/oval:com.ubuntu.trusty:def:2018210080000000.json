    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.16.7. A use-after-free can be caused by the function rsi_mac80211_detach in the file drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi_91x_mac80211.c. It was discovered that the RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not did not handle detach operations correctly, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
