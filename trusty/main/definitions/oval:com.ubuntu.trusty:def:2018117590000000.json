		"description": "The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requestedpath before matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk)Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44 did not handle some edge cases correctly. If onlya sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then itwas possible for a specially constructed request to expose applicationfunctionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clientsaccessing the application via the reverse proxy. It was also possible insome configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass theaccess controls configured in httpd. While there is some overlap betweenthis issue and CVE-2018-1323, they are not identical.",
