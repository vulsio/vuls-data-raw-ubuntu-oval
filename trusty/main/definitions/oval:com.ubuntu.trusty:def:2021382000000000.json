    "Title": "CVE-2021-38200 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "arch/powerpc/perf/core-book3s.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, on systems with perf_event_paranoid=-1 and no specific PMU driver support registered, allows local users to cause a denial of service (perf_instruction_pointer NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a \"perf record\" command. It was discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel for the PowerPC architecture contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
