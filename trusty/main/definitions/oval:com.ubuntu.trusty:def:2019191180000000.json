    "Title": "CVE-2019-19118 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Django 2.1 before 2.1.15 and 2.2 before 2.2.8 allows unintended model editing. A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where the user has view-only permissions to a parent model but edit permissions to the inline model, would be presented with an editing UI, allowing POST requests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-only parent model was not possible, but the parent model's save() method was called, triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and post-save signal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve this, the Django admin is adjusted to require edit permissions on the parent model in order for inline models to be editable.)",
