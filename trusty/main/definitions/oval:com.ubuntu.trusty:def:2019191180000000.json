		"description": "Django 2.1 before 2.1.15 and 2.2 before 2.2.8 allows unintended modelediting. A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where theuser has view-only permissions to a parent model but edit permissions tothe inline model, would be presented with an editing UI, allowing POSTrequests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-onlyparent model was not possible, but the parent model's save() method wascalled, triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and post-savesignal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve this, the Django admin isadjusted to require edit permissions on the parent model in order forinline models to be editable.)",
