		"Title": "CVE-2023-1583 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference was found in io_file_bitmap_get in io_uring/filetable.c in the io_uring sub-component in the Linux Kernel. When fixed files are unregistered, some context information (file_alloc_{start,end} and alloc_hint) is not cleared. A subsequent request that has auto index selection enabled via IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC can cause a NULL pointer dereference. An unprivileged user can use the flaw to cause a system crash. It was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform file table updates in some situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
