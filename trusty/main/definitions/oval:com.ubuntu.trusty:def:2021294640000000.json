		"description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A heap buffer overflowwas found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap overflow istriggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain codeexecution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a craftedimage file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata,which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata.For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, youneed to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug isfixed in version v0.27.4.",
