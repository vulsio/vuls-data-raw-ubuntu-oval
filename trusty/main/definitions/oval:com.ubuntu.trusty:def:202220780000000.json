		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's nft_set_desc_concat_parse() function .This flaw allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow via nft_set_desc_concat_parse() , causing a denial of service and possibly to run code. It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
