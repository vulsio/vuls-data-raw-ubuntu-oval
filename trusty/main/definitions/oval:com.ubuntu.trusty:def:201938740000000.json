		"Title": "CVE-2019-3874 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The SCTP socket buffer used by a userspace application is not accounted by the cgroups subsystem. An attacker can use this flaw to cause a denial of service attack. Kernel 3.10.x and 4.18.x branches are believed to be vulnerable. Matteo Croce, Natale Vinto, and Andrea Spagnolo discovered that the cgroups subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly account for SCTP socket buffers. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3874` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1045-azure - 4.15.0-1045.49~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1045-azure - 4.15.0-1045.49~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
