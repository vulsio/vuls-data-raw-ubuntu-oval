		"description": "Vim is an open source command line text editor. double-free indialog_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648. When abandoning a buffer, Vim may askthe user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changedbuffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer didnot have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vimwill falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possiblylater to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue hasbeen fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.",
