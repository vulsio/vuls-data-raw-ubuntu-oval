		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:virtio_net: Do not send RSS key if it is not supported There is a bug whensetting the RSS options in virtio_net that can break the whole machine,getting the kernel into an infinite loop. Running the following command inany QEMU virtual machine with virtionet will reproduce this problem: #ethtool -X eth0 hfunc toeplitz This is how the problem happens: 1)ethtool_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_set_rxfh() 2) virtnet_set_rxfh() callsvirtnet_commit_rss_command() 3) virtnet_commit_rss_command() populates 4entries for the rss scatter-gather 4) Since the command above does not havea key, then the last scatter-gatter entry will be zeroed, sincerss_key_size == 0. sg_buf_size = vi->rss_key_size; 5) This buffer is passedto qemu, but qemu is not happy with a buffer with zero length, and do thefollowing in virtqueue_map_desc() (QEMU function): if (!sz) {virtio_error(vdev, \"virtio: zero sized buffers are not allowed\"); 6)virtio_error() (also QEMU function) set the device as broken vdev->broken =true; 7) Qemu bails out, and do not repond this crazy kernel. 8) The kernelis waiting for the response to come back (function virtnet_send_command())9) The kernel is waiting doing the following : while(!virtqueue_get_buf(vi->cvq, &tmp) && !virtqueue_is_broken(vi->cvq))cpu_relax(); 10) None of the following functions above is true, thus, thekernel loops here forever. Keeping in mind that virtqueue_is_broken() doesnot look at the qemu `vdev->broken`, so, it never realizes that the vitiois broken at QEMU side. Fix it by not sending RSS commands if the featureis not available in the device.",
