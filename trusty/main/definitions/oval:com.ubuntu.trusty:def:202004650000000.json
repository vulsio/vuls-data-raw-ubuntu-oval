		"Description": "In various methods of hid-multitouch.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-162844689References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the HID multitouch implementation within the Linux kernel did not properly validate input events in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
