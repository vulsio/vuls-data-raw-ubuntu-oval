		"Title": "CVE-2019-15918 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10. SMB2_negotiate in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c has an out-of-bounds read because data structures are incompletely updated after a change from smb30 to smb21. It was discovered that the SMB networking file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
