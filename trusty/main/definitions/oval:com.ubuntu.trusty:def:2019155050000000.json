		"Description": "drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/technisat-usb2.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9 has an out-of-bounds read via crafted USB device traffic (which may be remote via usbip or usbredir). It was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
