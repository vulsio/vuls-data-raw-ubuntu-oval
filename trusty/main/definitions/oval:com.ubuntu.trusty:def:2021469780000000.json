		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: nVMX: Always make an attempt to map eVMCS after migrationWhen enlightened VMCS is in use and nested state is migrated withvmx_get_nested_state()/vmx_set_nested_state() KVM can't map evmcspage right away: evmcs gpa is not 'struct kvm_vmx_nested_state_hdr'and we can't read it from VP assist page because userspace may decideto restore HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE after restoring nested state(and QEMU, for example, does exactly that). To make sure eVMCS ismapped /vmx_set_nested_state() raises KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGESrequest.Commit f2c7ef3ba955 (\"KVM: nSVM: cancel KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGESon nested vmexit\") added KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES clearing tonested_vmx_vmexit() to make sure MSR permission bitmap is not switchedwhen an immediate exit from L2 to L1 happens right after migration (causedby a pending event, for example). Unfortunately, in the exact samesituation we still need to have eVMCS mapped sonested_sync_vmcs12_to_shadow() reflects changes in VMCS12 to eVMCS.As a band-aid, restore nested_get_evmcs_page() when clearingKVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES in nested_vmx_vmexit(). The 'fix' is farfrom being ideal as we can't easily propagate possible failures and even ifwe could, this is most likely already too late to do so. The whole'KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES' idea for mapping eVMCS after migrationseems to be fragile as we diverge too much from the 'native' path whenvmptr loading happens on vmx_set_nested_state().",
