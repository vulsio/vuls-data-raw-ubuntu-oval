		"Title": "CVE-2022-3344 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD nested virtualization (SVM). A malicious L1 guest could purposely fail to intercept the shutdown of a cooperative nested guest (L2), possibly leading to a page fault and kernel panic in the host (L0). Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle nested shutdown execution. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash)",
