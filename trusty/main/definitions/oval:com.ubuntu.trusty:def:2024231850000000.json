		"title": "CVE-2024-23185 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "Very large headers can cause resource exhaustion when parsing message. Themessage-parser normally reads reasonably sized chunks of the message.However, when it feeds them to message-header-parser, it starts building up\"full_value\" buffer out of the smaller chunks. The full_value buffer has nosize limit, so large headers can cause large memory usage. It doesn'tmatter whether it's a single long header line, or a single header splitinto multiple lines. This bug exists in all Dovecot versions. Incomingmails typically have some size limits set by MTA, so even largest possibleheader size may still fit into Dovecot's vsz_limit. So attackers probablycan't DoS a victim user this way. A user could APPEND larger mails though,allowing them to DoS themselves (although maybe cause some memory issuesfor the backend in general). One can implement restrictions on headers onMTA component preceding Dovecot. No publicly available exploits are known.",
