		"title": "CVE-2019-6477 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires asimilar resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP withoutpipelining enabled. A client using a TCP-pipelined connection to a servercould consume more resources than the server has been provisioned tohandle. When a TCP connection with a large number of pipelined queries isclosed, the load on the server releasing these multiple resources can causeit to become unresponsive, even for queries that can be answeredauthoritatively or from cache. (This is most likely to be perceived as anintermittent server problem).",
