		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tpm_tis_spi: Account for SPI header when allocating TPM SPI xfer bufferThe TPM SPI transfer mechanism uses MAX_SPI_FRAMESIZE for computing themaximum transfer length and the size of the transfer buffer. As such, itdoes not account for the 4 bytes of header that prepends the SPI dataframe. This can result in out-of-bounds accesses and was confirmed withKASAN.Introduce SPI_HDRSIZE to account for the header and use to allocate thetransfer buffer.",
