		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: idpf:fix kernel panic on unknown packet types In the very rare case where apacket type is unknown to the driver, idpf_rx_process_skb_fields wouldreturn early without calling eth_type_trans to set the skb protocol / thenetwork layer handler. This is especially problematic if tcpdump is runningwhen such a packet is received, i.e. it would cause a kernel panic.Instead, call eth_type_trans for every single packet, even when the packettype is unknown.",
