		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used forupdating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error tooccur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to reportwhat was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. Thiscaused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memoryaddress.Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safelyaccess the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,otherwise report what was in that location.",
