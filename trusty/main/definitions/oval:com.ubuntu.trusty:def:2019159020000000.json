		"description": "A backporting error was discovered in the Linux stable/longterm kernel4.4.x through 4.4.190, 4.9.x through 4.9.190, 4.14.x through 4.14.141,4.19.x through 4.19.69, and 5.2.x through 5.2.11. Misuse of the upstream\"x86/ptrace: Fix possible spectre-v1 in ptrace_get_debugreg()\" commitreintroduced the Spectre vulnerability that it aimed to eliminate. Thisoccurred because the backport process depends on cherry picking specificcommits, and because two (correctly ordered) code lines were swapped.",
