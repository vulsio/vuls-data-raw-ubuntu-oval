    "Title": "CVE-2020-28374 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7, insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code can be used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O operations are proxied via an attacker-selected backstore. It was discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation in the Linux kernel performed insufficient identifier checking in certain XCOPY requests. An attacker with access to at least one LUN in a multiple backstore environment could use this to expose sensitive information or modify data.",

This workaround does *not* affect XCOPY requests sent to tcmu-runner based backstores."
