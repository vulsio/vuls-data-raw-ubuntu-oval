		"Description": "In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7,insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code can be used byremote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPYrequest, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over anetwork if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gainscontrol over file access because I/O operations are proxied via anattacker-selected backstore.",
