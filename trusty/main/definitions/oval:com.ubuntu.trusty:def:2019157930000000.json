		"description": "In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, several locations which shift ids translateuser/group ids before performing operations in the lower filesystem weretranslating them into init_user_ns, whereas they should have beentranslated into the s_user_ns for the lower filesystem. This resulted inusing ids other than the intended ones in the lower fs, which likely didnot map into the shifts s_user_ns. A local attacker could use this topossibly bypass discretionary access control permissions.",
