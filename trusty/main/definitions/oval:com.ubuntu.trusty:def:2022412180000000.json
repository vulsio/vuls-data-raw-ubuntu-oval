		"Title": "CVE-2022-41218 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
