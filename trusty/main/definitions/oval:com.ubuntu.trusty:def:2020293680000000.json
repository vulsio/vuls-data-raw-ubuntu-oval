    "Title": "CVE-2020-29368 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in __split_huge_pmd in mm/huge_memory.c in the Linux kernel before 5.7.5. The copy-on-write implementation can grant unintended write access because of a race condition in a THP mapcount check, aka CID-c444eb564fb1. Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the copy-on-write implementation in the Linux kernel when handling hugepages. A local attacker could use this to gain unintended write access to read-only memory pages.",
