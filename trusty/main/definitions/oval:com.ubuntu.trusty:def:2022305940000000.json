		"Title": "CVE-2022-30594 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag. Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce seccomp restrictions in some situations. A local attacker could use this to bypass intended seccomp sandbox restrictions.",
