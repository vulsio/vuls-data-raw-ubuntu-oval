		"Title": "CVE-2021-29650 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The netfilter subsystem allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value, aka CID-175e476b8cdf. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
