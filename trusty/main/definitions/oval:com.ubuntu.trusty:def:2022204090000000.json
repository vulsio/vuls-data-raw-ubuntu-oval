    "Description": "In io_identity_cow of io_uring.c, there is a possible way to corrupt memory due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-238177383References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel.
