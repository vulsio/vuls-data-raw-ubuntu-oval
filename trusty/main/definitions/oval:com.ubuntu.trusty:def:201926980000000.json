    "Title": "CVE-2019-2698 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: 2D). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u211 and 8u202. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.1 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Mateusz Jurczyk discovered a vulnerability in the font layout engine of OpenJDK's 2D component. An attacker could use this to possibly escape Java sandbox restrictions.",
