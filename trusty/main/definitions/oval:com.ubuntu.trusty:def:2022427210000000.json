    "Title": "CVE-2022-42721 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A list management bug in BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux kernel 5.1 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to corrupt a linked list and, in turn, potentially execute code. Sönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly handle BSSID/SSID lists in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).",
