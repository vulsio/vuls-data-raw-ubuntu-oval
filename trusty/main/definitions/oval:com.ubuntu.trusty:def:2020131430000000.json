		"Title": "CVE-2020-13143 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store in drivers/usb/gadget/configfs.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.6.13 relies on kstrdup without considering the possibility of an internal '\\0' value, which allows attackers to trigger an out-of-bounds read, aka CID-15753588bcd4. It was discovered that the USB Gadget device driver in the Linux kernel did not validate arguments passed from configfs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
