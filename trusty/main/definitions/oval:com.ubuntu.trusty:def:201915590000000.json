		"Title": "CVE-2019-1559 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then callsSSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one)then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byterecord is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record isreceived with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differentlybased on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then thisamounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In orderfor this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use.Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonlyused ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice evenif a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but somedo anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).",
