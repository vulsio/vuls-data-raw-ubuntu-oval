    "Title": "CVE-2021-45868 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.15.3, fs/quota/quota_tree.c does not validate the block number in the quota tree (on disk). This can, for example, lead to a kernel/locking/rwsem.c use-after-free if there is a corrupted quota file. It was discovered that the file system quotas implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the quota block number. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious file system image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
