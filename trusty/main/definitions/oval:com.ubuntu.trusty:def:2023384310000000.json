    "Title": "CVE-2023-38431 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.8. fs/smb/server/connection.c in ksmbd does not validate the relationship between the NetBIOS header's length field and the SMB header sizes, via pdu_size in ksmbd_conn_handler_loop, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate packet header sizes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
