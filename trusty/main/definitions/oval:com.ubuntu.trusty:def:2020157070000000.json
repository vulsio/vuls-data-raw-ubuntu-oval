		"Title": "CVE-2020-15707 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd andgrub_initrd_init in the efilinux component of GRUB2, as shipped in Debian,Red Hat, and Ubuntu (the functionality is not included in GRUB2 upstream),leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. These could be triggered by anextremely large number of arguments to the initrd command on 32-bitarchitectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on anyarchitecture. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code andbypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04and prior versions.",
