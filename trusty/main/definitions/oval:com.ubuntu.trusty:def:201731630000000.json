		"description": "When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull indexfiles from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a filename. However, Solr before 5.5.4 and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not validate thefile name, hence it was possible to craft a special request involving pathtraversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed.Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/orauthentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and userswould gain direct HTTP access.",
