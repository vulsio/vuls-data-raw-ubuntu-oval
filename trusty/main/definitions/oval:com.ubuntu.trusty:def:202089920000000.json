    "Title": "CVE-2020-8992 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "ext4_protect_reserved_inode in fs/ext4/block_validity.c in the Linux kernel through 5.5.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) via a crafted journal size. Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (soft lockup).",
