		"Title": "CVE-2016-7055 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low",
		"Description": "There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomerymultiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c thathandles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysissuggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible.This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations withthe private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice.Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and keynegotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-keyoperations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only BrainpoolP-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH keynegotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites forattack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose thecurve in question and the server has to share the private key among them,neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chosethe curve will be affected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-7055` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21\nopenssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21\nNo subscription required",
