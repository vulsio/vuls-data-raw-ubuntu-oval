		"Title": "CVE-2022-1671 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rxrpc_preparse_s in net/rxrpc/server_key.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information. It was discovered that the RxRPC session socket implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle ioctls called when no security protocol is given. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
