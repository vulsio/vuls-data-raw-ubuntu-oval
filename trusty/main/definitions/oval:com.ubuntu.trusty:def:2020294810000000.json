		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of Xenstorenodes are per domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access rights are notremoved when a domain is being destroyed. This means that a new domaincreated with the same domid will inherit the access rights to Xenstorenodes from the previous domain(s) with the same domid. Because all Xenstoreentries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid> are being deleted by Xentools when a guest is destroyed, only Xenstore entries of other guestsstill running are affected. For example, a newly created guest domain mightbe able to read sensitive information that had belonged to a previouslyexisting guest domain. Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) arevulnerable.",
