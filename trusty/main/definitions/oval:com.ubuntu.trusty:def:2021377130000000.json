		"description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code executionvulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose locationwould be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. Thisis, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries withinthe archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, andresolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. Thislogic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files thatcontained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a driveletter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If thedrive letter does not match the extraction target, for example`D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory,entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:`drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..`portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as`C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for`..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This onlyaffects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressedin releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has beendeprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are stillusing a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version ofnode-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue withoutperforming the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar,rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.",
