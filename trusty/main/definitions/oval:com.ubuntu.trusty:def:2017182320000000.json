    "Title": "CVE-2017-18232 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.15.9 mishandles a mutex within libsas, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) by triggering certain error-handling code. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel when handling certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-18232` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
