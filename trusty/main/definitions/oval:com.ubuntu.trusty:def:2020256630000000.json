		"description": "A call to ConformPixelInfo() in the SetImageAlphaChannel() routine of/MagickCore/channel.c caused a subsequent heap-use-after-free orheap-buffer-overflow READ when GetPixelRed() or GetPixelBlue() was called.This could occur if an attacker is able to submit a malicious image file tobe processed by ImageMagick and could lead to denial of service. It likelywould not lead to anything further because the memory is used as pixel dataand not e.g. a function pointer. This flaw affects ImageMagick versionsprior to 7.0.9-0.",
