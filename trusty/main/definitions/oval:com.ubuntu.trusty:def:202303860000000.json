		"Title": "CVE-2023-0386 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s OverlayFS subsystem in how a user copies a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.",
