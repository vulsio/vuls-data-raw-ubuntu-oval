    "Title": "CVE-2019-15211 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2.6. There is a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c does not properly allocate memory. It was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
