		"Title": "CVE-2018-18559 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 4.19, a use-after-free can occur due to a racecondition between fanout_add from setsockopt and bind on an AF_PACKETsocket. This issue exists because of the15fe076edea787807a7cdc168df832544b58eba6 incomplete fix for a racecondition. The code mishandles a certain multithreaded case involving apacket_do_bind unregister action followed by a packet_notifier registeraction. Later, packet_release operates on only one of the two applicablelinked lists. The attacker can achieve Program Counter control.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18559` to fix the vulnerability.
