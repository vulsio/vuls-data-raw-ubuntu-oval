    "Title": "CVE-2020-15780 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c in the Linux kernel before 5.7.7. Injection of malicious ACPI tables via configfs could be used by attackers to bypass lockdown and secure boot restrictions, aka CID-75b0cea7bf30. Jason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict loading ACPI tables via configfs. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown restrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel.",
