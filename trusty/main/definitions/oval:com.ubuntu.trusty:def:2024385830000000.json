		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2:fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread Patch series \"nilfs2: fixlog writer related issues\". This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 logwriter-related issues, including a timer use-after-free issue and potentialdeadlock issue on unmount, and a potential freeze issue in eventsynchronization found during their analysis. Details are described in eachcommit log. This patch (of 3): A use-after-free issue has been reportedregarding the timer sc_timer on the nilfs_sc_info structure. The problem isthat even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log writer thread,sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure is about to befreed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime. Fix this issue bylimiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer thread is alive.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-38583` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-259-generic - 4.4.0-259.293~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-259-generic - 4.4.0-259.293~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-259-lowlatency - 4.4.0-259.293~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1136-aws - 4.4.0-1136.142\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
