		"Title": "CVE-2023-3611 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The qfq_change_agg() function in net/sched/sch_qfq.c allows an out-of-bounds write because lmax is updated according to packet sizes without bounds checks. We recommend upgrading past commit 3e337087c3b5805fe0b8a46ba622a962880b5d64. It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing network scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
