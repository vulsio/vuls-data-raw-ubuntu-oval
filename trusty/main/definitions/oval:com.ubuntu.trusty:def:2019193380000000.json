		"description": "A flaw was found in the fix for CVE-2019-11135, in the Linux upstreamkernel versions before 5.5 where, the way Intel CPUs handle speculativeexecution of instructions when a TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) error occurs.When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by the TAA flaw (TAA_NO=0),but is not affected by the MDS issue (MDS_NO=1), the guest was to clear theaffected buffers by using a VERW instruction mechanism. But when theMDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, the guests did not use the VERWmechanism to clear the affected buffers. This issue affects guests runningon Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that host has 'TSX' enabled.Confidentiality of data is the highest threat associated with thisvulnerability.",
