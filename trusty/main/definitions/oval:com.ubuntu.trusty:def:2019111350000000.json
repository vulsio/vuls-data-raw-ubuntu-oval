    "Title": "CVE-2019-11135 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "TSX Asynchronous Abort condition on some CPUs utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access. Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel processors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could expose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
