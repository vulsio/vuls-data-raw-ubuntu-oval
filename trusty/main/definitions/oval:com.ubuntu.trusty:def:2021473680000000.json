		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: enetc:Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint irq_set_affinity_hit() storesa reference to the cpumask_t parameter in the irq descriptor, and thatreference can be accessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Sincethe cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has only temporarystorage (it's on the stack memory), later accesses to it are illegal. Thusreads from the corresponding procfs affinity_hint file can result in pagingrequest oops. The issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, whichprovides a permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.",
