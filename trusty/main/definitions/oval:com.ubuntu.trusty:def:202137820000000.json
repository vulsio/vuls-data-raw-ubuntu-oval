		"description": "An internal reference count is held on the buffer pool, incremented everytime a new buffer is created from the pool. The reference count ismaintained as an int; on LP64 systems this can cause the reference count tooverflow if the client creates a large number of wl_shm buffer objects, orif it can coerce the server to create a large number of external referencesto the buffer storage. With the reference count overflowing, ause-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool tracking structure,where values may be incremented or decremented; it may also be possible toconstruct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to theattacking client at a time.",
