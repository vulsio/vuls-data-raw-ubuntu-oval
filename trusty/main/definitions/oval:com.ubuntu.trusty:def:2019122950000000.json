		"Title": "CVE-2019-12295 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "In Wireshark 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, 2.6.0 to 2.6.8, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.14, the dissection engine could crash. This was addressed in epan/packet.c by restricting the number of layers and consequently limiting recursion. It was discovered that Wireshark improperly handled certain input. A remote or local attacker could cause Wireshark to crash by injecting malformed packets onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
