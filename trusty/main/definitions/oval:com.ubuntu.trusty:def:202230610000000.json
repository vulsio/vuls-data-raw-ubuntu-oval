		"Title": "CVE-2022-3061 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Found Linux Kernel flaw in the i740 driver. The Userspace program could pass any values to the driver through ioctl() interface. The driver doesn't check the value of 'pixclock', so it may cause a divide by zero error. It was discovered that the Intel 740 frame buffer driver in the Linux kernel contained a divide by zero vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
