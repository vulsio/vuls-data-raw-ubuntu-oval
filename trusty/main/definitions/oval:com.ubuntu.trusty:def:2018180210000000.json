		"title": "CVE-2018-18021 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c in KVM in the Linux kernel before 4.18.12 on thearm64 platform mishandles the KVM_SET_ON_REG ioctl. This is exploitable byattackers who can create virtual machines. An attacker can arbitrarilyredirect the hypervisor flow of control (with full register control). Anattacker can also cause a denial of service (hypervisor panic) via anillegal exception return. This occurs because of insufficient restrictionson userspace access to the core register file, and because PSTATE.Mvalidation does not prevent unintended execution modes.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18021` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-lowlatency - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
