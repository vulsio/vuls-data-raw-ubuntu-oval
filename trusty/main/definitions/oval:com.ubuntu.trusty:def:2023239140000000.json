		"description": "A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists incurl <v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality fail when multiple URLsare requested serially. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed touse HTTPS instead of usingan insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTPis provided in the URL. ThisHSTS mechanism would however surprisingly beignored by subsequent transferswhen done on the same command line becausethe state would not be properlycarried on.",
