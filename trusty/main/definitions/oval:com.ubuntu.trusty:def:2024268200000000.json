		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hv_netvsc: Register VF in netvsc_probe if NET_DEVICE_REGISTER missedIf hv_netvsc driver is unloaded and reloaded, the NET_DEVICE_REGISTERhandler cannot perform VF register successfully as the register callis received before netvsc_probe is finished. This is because weregister register_netdevice_notifier() very early( even beforevmbus_driver_register()).To fix this, we try to register each such matching VF( if it is visibleas a netdevice) at the end of netvsc_probe.",
