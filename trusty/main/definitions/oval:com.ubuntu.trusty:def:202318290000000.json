    "Title": "CVE-2023-1829 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. We recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28. It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for the TCINDEX classifier has been removed.",
