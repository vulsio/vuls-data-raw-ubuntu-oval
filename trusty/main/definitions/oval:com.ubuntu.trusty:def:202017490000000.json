		"Title": "CVE-2020-1749 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of some networkingprotocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6. When anencrypted tunnel is created between two hosts, the kernel isn't correctlyrouting tunneled data over the encrypted link; rather sending the dataunencrypted. This would allow anyone in between the two endpoints to readthe traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to dataconfidentiality.",
