		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs:sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection() Thesysfs_break_active_protection() routine has an obvious reference leak inits error path. If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails then kn will beNULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection() routine won't getcalled (and would only cause an access violation by trying to dereferencekn->parent if it was called). As a result, the reference to kobj acquiredat the start of the function will never be released. Fix the leak by addingan explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26993` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500 - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500mc - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-smp - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-emb - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-smp - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
