		"Title": "CVE-2014-4715 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Yann Collet LZ4 before r119, when used on certain 32-bit platforms that allocate memory beyond 0x80000000, does not properly detect integer overflows, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Literal Run, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-4611. It was discovered that LZ4 incorrectly handled integers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-4715` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 42.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nfirefox-globalmenu - 42.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 42.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nfirefox-testsuite - 42.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nthunderbird - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nthunderbird-globalmenu - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nthunderbird-testsuite - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:38.4.0+build3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
