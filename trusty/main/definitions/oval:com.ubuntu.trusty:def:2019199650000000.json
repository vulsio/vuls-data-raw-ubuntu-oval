		"Title": "CVE-2019-19965 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.4.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_discover.c because of mishandling of port disconnection during discovery, related to a PHY down race condition, aka CID-f70267f379b5. Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
