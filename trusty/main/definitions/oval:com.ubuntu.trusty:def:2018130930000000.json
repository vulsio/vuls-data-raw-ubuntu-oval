		"Title": "CVE-2018-13093 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during allocation. Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly track inode validations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
