		"Title": "CVE-2019-15217 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/zr364xx/zr364xx.c driver. It was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
