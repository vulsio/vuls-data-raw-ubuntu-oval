		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfs: pass explicit offset/count to trace eventsnfs_folio_length is unsafe to use without having the folio locked and acheck for a NULL ->f_mapping that protects against truncations and canlead to kernel crashes.  E.g. when running xfstests generic/065 withall nfs trace points enabled.Follow the model of the XFS trace points and pass in an expl?cit offsetand length.  This has the additional benefit that these values canbe more accurate as some of the users touch partial folio ranges.",
