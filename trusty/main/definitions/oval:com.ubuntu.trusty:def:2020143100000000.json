		"Description": "There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at functionread_section_as_string(). It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX -1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it before proceed with bufferallocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker may leveragethat by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX,leading to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sizedallocation and further heap-based buffer overflow.",
