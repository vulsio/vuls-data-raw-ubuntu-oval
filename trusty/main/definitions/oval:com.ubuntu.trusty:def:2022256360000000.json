		"Title": "CVE-2022-25636 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "net/netfilter/nf_dup_netdev.c in the Linux kernel 5.4 through 5.6.10 allows local users to gain privileges because of a heap out-of-bounds write. This is related to nf_tables_offload. Nick Gregory discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly handled network offload functionality. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
