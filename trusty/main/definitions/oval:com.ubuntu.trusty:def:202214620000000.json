		"Title": "CVE-2022-1462 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s TeleTYpe subsystem. The issue occurs in how a user triggers a race condition using ioctls TIOCSPTLCK and TIOCGPTPEER and TIOCSTI and TCXONC with leakage of memory in the flush_to_ldisc function. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or read unauthorized random data from memory. It was discovered that the tty subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.",
