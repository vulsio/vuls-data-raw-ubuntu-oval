    "Title": "CVE-2019-13631 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In parse_hid_report_descriptor in drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.1, a malicious USB device can send an HID report that triggers an out-of-bounds write during generation of debugging messages. It was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did not properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
