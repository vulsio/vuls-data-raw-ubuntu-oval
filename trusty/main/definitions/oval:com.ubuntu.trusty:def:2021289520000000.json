		"Title": "CVE-2021-28952 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. The sound/soc/qcom/sdm845.c soundwire device driver has a buffer overflow when an unexpected port ID number is encountered, aka CID-1c668e1c0a0f. (This has been fixed in 5.12-rc4.) John Stultz discovered that the audio driver for Qualcomm SDM845 systems in the Linux kernel did not properly validate port ID numbers. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
