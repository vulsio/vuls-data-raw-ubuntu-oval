    "Title": "CVE-2022-4129 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A missing lock when clearing sk_user_data can lead to a race condition and NULL pointer dereference. A local user could use this flaw to potentially crash the system causing a denial of service. Haowei Yan discovered that a race condition existed in the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
