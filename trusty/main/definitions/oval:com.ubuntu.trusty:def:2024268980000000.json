		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pktsThis patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or  potential code execution.In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initialcode is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used inlater tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that thedev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skbinitial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run intouse-after-free because the net_device is freed.This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path inaoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().",
