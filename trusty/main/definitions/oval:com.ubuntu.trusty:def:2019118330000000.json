		"Title": "CVE-2019-11833 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.2 does not zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
