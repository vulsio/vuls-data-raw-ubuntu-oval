		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()The timer instance per queue is exclusive, and snd_seq_timer_open()should have managed the concurrent accesses.  It looks as if it'schecking the already existing timer instance at the beginning, butit's not right, because there is no protection, hence any laterconcurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timerinstance easily.  This may result in UAF, as the leftover timerinstance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed, asspotted by syzkaller recently.For avoiding the race, add a proper check at the assignment oftmr->timeri again, and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.",
