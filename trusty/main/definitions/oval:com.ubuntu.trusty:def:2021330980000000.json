    "Title": "CVE-2021-33098 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. Asaf Modelevsky discovered that the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate large MTU requests from Virtual Function (VF) devices. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
