		"Description": "An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the Linux kernel, all versionsthrough 5.3, in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements theCoalesced MMIO write operation. It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'structkvm_coalesced_mmio' object, wherein write indices 'ring->first' and'ring->last' value could be supplied by a host user-space process. Anunprivileged host user or process with access to '/dev/kvm' device coulduse this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service orpotentially escalating privileges on the system.",
