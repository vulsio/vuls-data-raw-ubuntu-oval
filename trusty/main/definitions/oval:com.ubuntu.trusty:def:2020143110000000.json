		"Title": "CVE-2020-14311 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "There is an issue with grub2 before version 2.06 while handling symlink on ext filesystems. A filesystem containing a symbolic link with an inode size of UINT32_MAX causes an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-sized memory allocation with subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2 when handling certain filesystems, font files or PNG images, leading to heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
