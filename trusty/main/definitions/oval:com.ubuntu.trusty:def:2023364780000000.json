		"description": "Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52,an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACKheader values to exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determinesif a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exceptionif the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman istrue, the multiplication by 4 in line 295 will overflow, and length willbecome negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check online 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize`allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative,potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when theuser-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides anegative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, whenmultiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value isa very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can causea very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can beimpacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed inversions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.",
