    "Title": "CVE-2018-9415 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In driver_override_store and driver_override_show of bus.c, there is a possible double free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A-69129004 References: Upstream kernel. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-9415` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1023-aws - 4.4.0-1023.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-generic - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-lowlatency - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-128-generic - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-generic - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-lowlatency - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-128-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-128-generic - 4.4.0-128.154~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
