    "Title": "CVE-2021-3744 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
