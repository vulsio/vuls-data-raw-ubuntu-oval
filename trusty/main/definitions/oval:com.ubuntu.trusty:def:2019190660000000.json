		"Title": "CVE-2019-19066 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A memory leak in the bfad_im_get_stats() function in drivers/scsi/bfa/bfad_attr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering bfa_port_get_stats() failures, aka CID-0e62395da2bd. It was discovered that the Brocade BFA Fibre Channel device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
