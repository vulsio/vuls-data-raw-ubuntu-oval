		"Title": "CVE-2020-27815 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the JFS filesystem code in the Linux Kernel which allows a local attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to panic the system, causing memory corruption or escalating privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. It was discovered that the jfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash).",
