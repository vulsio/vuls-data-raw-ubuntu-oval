    "Title": "CVE-2022-47940 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in ksmbd in the Linux kernel 5.15 through 5.18 before 5.18.18. fs/ksmbd/smb2pdu.c lacks length validation in the non-padding case in smb2_write. Arnaud Gatignol, Quentin Minster, Florent Saudel and Guillaume Teissier discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate user-supplied data in some situations. An authenticated attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
