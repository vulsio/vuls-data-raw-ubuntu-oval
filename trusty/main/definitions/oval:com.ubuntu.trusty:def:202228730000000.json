    "Description": "An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel Intelâ€™s iSMT SMBus host controller driver in the way a user triggers the I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_DATA (with the ioctl I2C_SMBUS) with malicious input data. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. Zheyu Ma discovered that the Intel iSMT SMBus host controller driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
