	"version": "1",
	"metadata": {
		"Title": "CVE-2017-1000405 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high",
		"Description": "The Linux Kernel versions 2.6.38 through 4.14 have a problematic use ofpmd_mkdirty() in the touch_pmd() function inside the THP implementation.touch_pmd() can be reached by get_user_pages(). In such case, the pmd willbecome dirty. This scenario breaks the new can_follow_write_pmd()'s logic -pmd can become dirty without going through a COW cycle. This bug is not assevere as the original \"Dirty cow\" because an ext4 file (or any otherregular file) cannot be mapped using THP. Nevertheless, it does allow us tooverwrite read-only huge pages. For example, the zero huge page and sealedshmem files can be overwritten (since their mapping can be populated usingTHP). Note that after the first write page-fault to the zero page, it willbe replaced with a new fresh (and zeroed) thp.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000405` to fix the vulnerability.
