		"Title": "CVE-2017-6347 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The ip_cmsg_recv_checksum function in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.1 has incorrect expectations about skb data layout, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, as demonstrated by use of the MSG_MORE flag in conjunction with loopback UDP transmission. Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IP layer in the Linux kernel made improper assumptions about internal data layout when performing checksums. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-6347` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-generic - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-lowlatency - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-75-generic - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-generic - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-lowlatency - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-75-generic - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
