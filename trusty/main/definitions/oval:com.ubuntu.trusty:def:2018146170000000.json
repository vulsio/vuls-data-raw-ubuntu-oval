		"Title": "CVE-2018-14617 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in hfsplus_lookup() in fs/hfsplus/dir.c when opening a file (that is purportedly a hard link) in an hfs+ filesystem that has malformed catalog data, and is mounted read-only without a metadata directory. Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-14617` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1034-aws - 4.4.0-1034.37\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-lowlatency - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-lowlatency - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-139-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-139-generic - 4.4.0-139.165~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
