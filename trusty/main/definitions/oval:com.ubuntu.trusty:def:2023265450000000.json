    "Title": "CVE-2023-26545 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.1.13, there is a double free in net/mpls/af_mpls.c upon an allocation failure (for registering the sysctl table under a new location) during the renaming of a device. Lianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions, leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
