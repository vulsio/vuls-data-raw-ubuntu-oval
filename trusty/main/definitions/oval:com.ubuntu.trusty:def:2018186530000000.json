    "Title": "CVE-2018-18653 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel, as used in Ubuntu 18.10 and when booted with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, allows privileged local users to bypass intended Secure Boot restrictions and execute untrusted code by loading arbitrary kernel modules. This occurs because a modified kernel/module.c, in conjunction with certain configuration options, leads to mishandling of the result of signature verification. Daniel Dadap discovered that the module loading implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce signed module loading when booted with UEFI Secure Boot in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to execute untrusted code in the kernel.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18653` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",

    "Note": "sbeattie> from the commit addressing the issue: Recent versions of the \"secure boot lockdown\" patches introduced support for using IMA signatures for module signing instead of the standard mechanism. This was causing issues and was removed, but the code was missed which actually defers the verification to IMA when IMA enforcement is enabled. With our config this means that by default module signatures are not being enforced under kernel lockdown."
