		"Description": "In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, andgreater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, in a case where anattacker manages to generate a valid cryptographic message authenticationcode (HMAC-SHA1) - either by using a different existing vulnerability or incase the internal encryptionKey was exposed - it is possible to retrievearbitrary files of a TYPO3 installation. This includes the possibility tofetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, which again contains theencryptionKey as well as credentials of the database management systembeing used. In case a database server is directly accessible either viainternet or in a shared hosting network, this allows the ability tocompletely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includescreating an administration user account - which can be used to triggerremote code execution by injecting custom extensions. This has been patchedin versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.",
