		"description": "OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 witha server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL andTLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack whenunpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versionsgreater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A serverthat supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attemptsfrom a client where this special form of padding is present, because thisindicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and serversupport greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is beingrequested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic sothat the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, andrejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept aconnection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the serverwill erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attemptis made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x areaffected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1)have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2)have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) haveconfigured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuitelist) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is notvulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation ofthe RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects theRSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function stillexists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications thatdirectly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter thisissue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premiumsupport customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other usersshould upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).",
