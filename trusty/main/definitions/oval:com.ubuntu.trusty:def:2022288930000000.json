    "Title": "CVE-2022-28893 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The SUNRPC subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.17.2 can call xs_xprt_free before ensuring that sockets are in the intended state. Felix Fu discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket states, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
