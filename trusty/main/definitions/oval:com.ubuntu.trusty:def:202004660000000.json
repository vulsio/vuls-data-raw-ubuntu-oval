    "Description": "In do_epoll_ctl and ep_loop_check_proc of eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free due to a logic error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-147802478References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the eventpoll (aka epoll) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a logic error that could lead to a use after free vulnerability.
