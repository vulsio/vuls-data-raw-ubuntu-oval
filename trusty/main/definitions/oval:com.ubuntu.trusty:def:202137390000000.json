		"Title": "CVE-2021-3739 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the btrfs_rm_device function in fs/btrfs/volumes.c in the Linux Kernel, where triggering the bug requires ‘CAP_SYS_ADMIN’. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly handle removing a non-existent device id. An attacker with CAP_SYS_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service.",
