Deferred while waiting for upstream to address the issue -- I suspect the fix is simple, but the consequences may not be. jdstrand> Ignoring. VMs are confined by AppArmor and are not able to read each other's files. Even if this were not the case, the files would be readable by the the libvirt-qemu:kvm user, so changing the permissions to 0640 would not help greatly. Therefore the protection would only be against other users on the system and a typical production Nova installation will not have these types of users or extra services. Furthermore, changing the permissions in a security update could be disruptive to production systems on upgrade. no upstream fix as of 2014-05-05"
