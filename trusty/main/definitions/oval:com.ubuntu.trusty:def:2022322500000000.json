    "Title": "CVE-2022-32250 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able to create user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to a use-after-free. Aaron Adams discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle non-statefule expressions in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
