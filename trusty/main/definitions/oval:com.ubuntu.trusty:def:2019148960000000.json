		"Title": "CVE-2019-14896 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel, version kernel-2.6.32, in Marvell WiFi chip driver. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when the lbs_ibss_join_existing function is called after a STA connects to an AP. It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell Libertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
