		"description": "The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointerdereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of largemlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's finalthread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlockedvmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range()since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine ifany other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1000200` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
