		"Title": "CVE-2013-1819 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "The _xfs_buf_find function in fs/xfs/xfs_buf.c in the Linux kernel before 3.7.6 does not validate block numbers, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the ability to mount an XFS filesystem containing a metadata inode with an invalid extent map. A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2013-1819` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required",
