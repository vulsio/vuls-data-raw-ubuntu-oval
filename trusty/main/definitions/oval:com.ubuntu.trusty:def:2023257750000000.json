		"Title": "CVE-2023-25775 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Improper access control in the Intel(R) Ethernet Controller RDMA driver for linux before version 1.9.30 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via network access. Ivan D Barrera, Christopher Bednarz, Mustafa Ismail, and Shiraz Saleem discovered that the InfiniBand RDMA driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for zero-length STAG or MR registration. A remote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code.",
