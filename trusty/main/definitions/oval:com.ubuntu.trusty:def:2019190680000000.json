		"Title": "CVE-2019-19068 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A memory leak in the rtl8xxxu_submit_int_urb() function in drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl8xxxu/rtl8xxxu_core.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering usb_submit_urb() failures, aka CID-a2cdd07488e6. It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8xxx USB Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
