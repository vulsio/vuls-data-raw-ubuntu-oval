		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic fetchThe change in commit 37086bfdc737 (\"bpf: Propagate stack bounds toregistersin atomics w/ BPF_FETCH\") around check_mem_access() handling is buggy sincethis would allow for unprivileged users to leak kernel pointers. Forexample,an atomic fetch/and with -1 on a stack destination which holds a spilledpointer will migrate the spilled register type into a scalar, which canthenbe exported out of the program (since scalar != pointer) by dumping it intoa map value.The original implementation of XADD was preventing this situation by usinga double call to check_mem_access() one with BPF_READ and a subsequent onewith BPF_WRITE, in both cases passing -1 as a placeholder value instead ofregister as per XADD semantics since it didn't contain a value fetch. TheBPF_READ also included a check in check_stack_read_fixed_off() whichrejectsthe program if the stack slot is of __is_pointer_value() if dst_regno < 0.The latter is to distinguish whether we're dealing with a regular stackspill/fill or some arithmetical operation which is disallowed on non-scalars, seealso 6e7e63cbb023 (\"bpf: Forbid XADD on spilled pointers for unprivilegedusers\") for more context on check_mem_access() and its handling ofplaceholdervalue -1.One minimally intrusive option to fix the leak is for the BPF_FETCH case toinitially check the BPF_READ case via check_mem_access() with -1 asregister,followed by the actual load case with non-negative load_reg to propagatestack bounds to registers.",
