		"description": "There are several memory leaks in the MIFF coder in /coders/miff.c due toimproper image depth values, which can be triggered by a specially craftedinput file. These leaks could potentially lead to an impact to applicationavailability or cause a denial of service. It was originally reported thatthe issues were in `AcquireMagickMemory()` because that is whereLeakSanitizer detected the leaks, but the patch resolves issues in the MIFFcoder, which incorrectly handles data being passed to`AcquireMagickMemory()`. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to7.0.9-0.",
