    "Title": "CVE-2022-1263 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference issue was found in KVM when releasing a vCPU with dirty ring support enabled. This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service. Qiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered that the kvm implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle releasing a virtual cpu properly. A local attacker in a guest VM coud possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash).",
