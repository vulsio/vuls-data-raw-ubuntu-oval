    "Title": "CVE-2019-19524 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.3.12, there is a use-after-free bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/input/ff-memless.c driver, aka CID-fa3a5a1880c9. It was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input devices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
