		"description": "issues with partially successful P2M updates on x86 T[his CNA informationrecord relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains whichaspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH guestsmay be started in populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, to provide a way for themto later easily have more memory assigned. Guests are permitted to controlcertain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercallsmay act on ranges of pages specified via page orders (resulting in apower-of-2 number of pages). In some cases the hypervisor carries out therequests by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error handling in certainPoD cases has been insufficient in that in particular partial success ofsome operations was not properly accounted for. There are two code pathsaffected - page removal (CVE-2021-28705) and insertion of new pages(CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one patch which combines the fix to bothissues.)",
