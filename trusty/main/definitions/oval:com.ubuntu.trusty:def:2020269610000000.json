		"description": "When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and relatedIP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoHresolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, theseaddresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNSRebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR <78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.",
