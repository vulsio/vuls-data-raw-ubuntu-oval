		"Title": "CVE-2020-10690 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "There is a use-after-free in kernel versions before 5.5 due to a racecondition between the release of ptp_clock and cdev while resourcedeallocation. When a (high privileged) process allocates a ptp device file(like /dev/ptpX) and voluntarily goes to sleep. During this time if theunderlying device is removed, it can cause an exploitable condition as theprocess wakes up to terminate and clean all attached files. The systemcrashes due to the cdev structure being invalid (as already freed) which ispointed to by the inode.",
