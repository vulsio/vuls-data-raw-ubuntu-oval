		"Title": "CVE-2022-24959 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in yam_siocdevprivate in drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c. It was discovered that the YAM AX.25 device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
