		"description": "LibreOffice documents can contain macros. The execution of those macros iscontrolled by the document security settings, typically execution of macrosare blocked by default. A URL decoding flaw existed in how the urls to themacros within the document were processed and categorized, resulting in thepossibility to construct a document where macro execution bypassed thesecurity settings. The documents were correctly detected as containingmacros, and prompted the user to their existence within the documents, butmacros within the document were subsequently not controlled by the securitysettings allowing arbitrary macro execution This issue affects: LibreOffice6.2 series versions prior to 6.2.7; LibreOffice 6.3 series versions priorto 6.3.1.",
