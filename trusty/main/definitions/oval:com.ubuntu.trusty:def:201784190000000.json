		"Title": "CVE-2017-8419 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "LAME through 3.99.5 relies on the signed integer data type for values in a WAV or AIFF header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow or heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by mishandling of num_channels. It was discovered that LAME incorrectly handled certain audio files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.",
