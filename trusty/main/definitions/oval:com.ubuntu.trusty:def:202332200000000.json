		"Title": "CVE-2023-3220 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.1-rc8. dpu_crtc_atomic_check in drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_crtc.c lacks check of the return value of kzalloc() and will cause the NULL Pointer Dereference. It was discovered that the Qualcomm MSM DPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate memory allocations in certain situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
