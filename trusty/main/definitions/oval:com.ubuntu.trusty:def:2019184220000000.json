		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS usersto cause a denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging the erroneousenabling of interrupts. Interrupts are unconditionally unmasked inexception handlers. When an exception occurs on an ARM system which ishandled without changing processor level, some interrupts areunconditionally enabled during exception entry. So exceptions which occurwhen interrupts are masked will effectively unmask the interrupts. Amalicious guest might contrive to arrange for critical Xen code to run withinterrupts erroneously enabled. This could lead to data corruption, denialof service, or possibly even privilege escalation. However a precise attacktechnique has not been identified.",
