		"Title": "CVE-2022-24122 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "kernel/ucount.c in the Linux kernel 5.14 through 5.16.4, when unprivileged user namespaces are enabled, allows a use-after-free and privilege escalation because a ucounts object can outlive its namespace. It was discovered that the rlimit tracking for user namespaces in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
