		"description": "A signal access-control issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before5.6.5, aka CID-7395ea4e65c2. Because exec_id in include/linux/sched.h isonly 32 bits, an integer overflow can interfere with a do_notify_parentprotection mechanism. A child process can send an arbitrary signal to aparent process in a different security domain. Exploitation limitationsinclude the amount of elapsed time before an integer overflow occurs, andthe lack of scenarios where signals to a parent process present asubstantial operational threat.",
