    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in nci_request in net/nfc/nci/core.c in NFC Controller Interface (NCI) in the Linux kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker with user privileges to cause a data race problem while the device is getting removed, leading to a privilege escalation problem. Lin Ma discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
