		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** A certain Postfix 2.10.1-7 package could allow an attackerto send an email from an arbitrary-looking sender via a homoglyph attack,as demonstrated by the similarity of \\xce\\xbf to the 'o' character. This ispotentially relevant when the /etc/postfix/sender_login feature is used,because a spoofed outbound message that uses a configured sender address isblocked with a \"Sender address rejected: not logged in\" error message, buta spoofed outbound message that uses a homoglyph of a configured senderaddress is not blocked. NOTE: some third parties argue that any missedblocking of spoofed outbound messages - except for exact matches to asender address in the /etc/postfix/sender_login file - is outside thedesign goals of Postfix and thus cannot be considered a Postfixvulnerability.",
