		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: virt_wifi: avoid reporting connection success with wrong SSIDWhen user issues a connection with a different SSID than the onevirt_wifi has advertised, the __cfg80211_connect_result() willtrigger the warning: WARN_ON(bss_not_found).The issue is because the connection code in virt_wifi does notcheck the SSID from user space (it only checks the BSSID), andvirt_wifi will call cfg80211_connect_result() with WLAN_STATUS_SUCCESSeven if the SSID is different from the one virt_wifi has advertised.Eventually cfg80211 won't be able to find the cfg80211_bss and generatethe warning.Fixed it by checking the SSID (from user space) in the connection code.",
