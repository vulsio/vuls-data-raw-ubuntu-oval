		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup indrivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There isan unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker tocause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “The memoryallocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boottime, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibilityfor an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.”.",
