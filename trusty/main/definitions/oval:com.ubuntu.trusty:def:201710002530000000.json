		"title": "CVE-2017-1000253 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high",
		"description": "Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels withhttps://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86(committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported toLinux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat.With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-downaddress allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIEbinary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base.Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need toallocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while thefirst PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOADsegment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that issupposed to be the \"gap\" between the stack and the binary.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000253` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-generic - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-lowlatency - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-57.95\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-57-generic - 3.13.0-57.95\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
