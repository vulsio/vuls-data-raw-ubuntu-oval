		"Title": "CVE-2019-19947 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.4.6, there are information leaks of uninitialized memory to a USB device in the drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_leaf.c driver, aka CID-da2311a6385c. It was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
