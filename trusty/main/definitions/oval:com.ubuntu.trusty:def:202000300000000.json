		"Note": "cascardo> This seems to be like that since binder was added to the kernel, ie., binder would allow the thread to be freed while its wait member was still in the epoll waitqueue. Description was taken from patch's comment, as it describes the specific race condition that makes this different from CVE-2019-2215. I added the first sentence which would be a fair description of both this CVE and CVE-2019-2215."
