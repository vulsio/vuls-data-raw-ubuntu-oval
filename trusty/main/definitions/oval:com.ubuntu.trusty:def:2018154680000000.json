		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The DEBUGCTL MSR containsseveral debugging features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some donot. In particular, Branch Trace Store is not virtualised by the processor,and software has to be careful to configure it suitably not to lock up thecore. As a result, it must only be available to fully trusted guests.Unfortunately, in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking wasskipped, allowing the guest to choose any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes. Amalicious or buggy guest administrator (on Intel x86 HVM or PVH) can lockup the entire host, causing a Denial of Service.",
