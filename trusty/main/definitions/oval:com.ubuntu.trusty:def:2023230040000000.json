		"Title": "CVE-2023-23004 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.19, drivers/gpu/drm/arm/malidp_planes.c misinterprets the get_sg_table return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually an error pointer). It was discovered that the ARM Mali Display Processor driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
