		"Title": "CVE-2023-2898 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "There is a null-pointer-dereference flaw found in f2fs_write_end_io in fs/f2fs/data.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local privileged user to cause a denial of service problem. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
