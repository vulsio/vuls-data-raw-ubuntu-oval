    "Title": "CVE-2019-20908 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/firmware/efi/efi.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4. Incorrect access permissions for the efivar_ssdt ACPI variable could be used by attackers to bypass lockdown or secure boot restrictions, aka CID-1957a85b0032. Jason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict loading SSDT code from an EFI variable. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown restrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel.",
