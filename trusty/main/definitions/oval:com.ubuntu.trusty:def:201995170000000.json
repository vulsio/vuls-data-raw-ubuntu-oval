		"Description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal databuffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opensthe HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, theyleave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) thebytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a largeresponse object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this canconsume excess memory, CPU, or both.",
