    "Description": "The aoedisk_debugfs_show function in drivers/block/aoe/aoeblk.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.4rc4 allows local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading \"ffree: \" lines in a debugfs file. It was discovered that the debugfs implementation in the linux kernel could expose kernel addresses. A privileged attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability.",
