    "Description": "drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function. Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
