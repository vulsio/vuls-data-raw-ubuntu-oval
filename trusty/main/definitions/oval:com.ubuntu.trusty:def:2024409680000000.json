		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:MIPS: Octeon: Add PCIe link status checkThe standard PCIe configuration read-write interface is used toaccess the configuration space of the peripheral PCIe devicesof the mips processor after the PCIe link surprise down, it cangenerate kernel panic caused by \"Data bus error\". So it isnecessary to add PCIe link status check for system protection.When the PCIe link is down or in training, assigning a valueof 0 to the configuration address can prevent read-write behaviorto the configuration space of peripheral PCIe devices, therebypreventing kernel panic.",
