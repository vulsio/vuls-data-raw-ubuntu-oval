		"Title": "CVE-2021-20194 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "There is a vulnerability in the linux kernel versions higher than 5.2 (if kernel compiled with config params CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y , CONFIG_BPF=y , CONFIG_CGROUPS=y , CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y , CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY not set, and BPF hook to getsockopt is registered). As result of BPF execution, the local user can trigger bug in __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_getsockopt() function that can lead to heap overflow (because of non-hardened usercopy). The impact of attack could be deny of service or possibly privileges escalation. Loris Reiff discovered that the BPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in the getsockopt BPF hook. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
