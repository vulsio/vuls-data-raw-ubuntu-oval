		"Description": "In binder_transaction of binder.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-136210786References: Upstream kernel It was discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
