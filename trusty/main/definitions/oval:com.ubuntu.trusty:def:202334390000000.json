    "Title": "CVE-2023-3439 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the MCTP protocol in the Linux kernel. The function mctp_unregister() reclaims the device's relevant resource when a netcard detaches. However, a running routine may be unaware of this and cause the use-after-free of the mdev->addrs object, potentially leading to a denial of service. Lin Ma discovered that a race condition existed in the MCTP implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
