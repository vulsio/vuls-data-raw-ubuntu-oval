    "Title": "CVE-2021-45402 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The check_alu_op() function in kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through v5.16-rc5 did not properly update bounds while handling the mov32 instruction, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive address information, aka a \"pointer leak.\" It was discovered that the eBPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking on mov32 operations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel pointer addresses).",
