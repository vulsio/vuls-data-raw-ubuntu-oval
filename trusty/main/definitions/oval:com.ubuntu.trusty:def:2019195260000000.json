		"Title": "CVE-2019-19526 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.3.9, there is a use-after-free bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/nfc/pn533/usb.c driver, aka CID-6af3aa57a098. It was discovered that the NXP PN533 NFC USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly free resources after a late probe error, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
