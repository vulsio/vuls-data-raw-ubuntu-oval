    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in kvm_s390_guest_sida_op in the arch/s390/kvm/kvm-s390.c function in KVM for s390 in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to obtain unauthorized memory write access. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.17-rc4. It was discovered that the KVM implementation for s390 systems in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent memory operations on PVM guests that were in non-protected mode. A local attacker could use this to obtain unauthorized memory write access.",
