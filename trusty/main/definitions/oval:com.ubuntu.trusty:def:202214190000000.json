		"Title": "CVE-2022-1419 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The root cause of this vulnerability is that the ioctl$DRM_IOCTL_MODE_DESTROY_DUMB can decrease refcount of *drm_vgem_gem_object *(created in *vgem_gem_dumb_create*) concurrently, and *vgem_gem_dumb_create *will access the freed drm_vgem_gem_object. It was discovered that the virtual graphics memory manager implementation in the Linux kernel was subject to a race condition, potentially leading to an information leak.",
