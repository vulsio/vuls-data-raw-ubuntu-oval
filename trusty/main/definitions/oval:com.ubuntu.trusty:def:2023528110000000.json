		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event poolIn practice the driver should never send more commands than are allocatedto a queue's event pool. In the unlikely event that this happens, the codeasserts a BUG_ON, and in the case that the kernel is not configured tocrash on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event listcausing things to spiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifactof the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed, and it is well known now thatthe use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverablescenario. There is nothing about this scenario that prevents the driverfrom recovering and carrying on.Remove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() and return a NULLpointer in the case of an empty event pool. Update all call sites toibmvfc_get_event() to check for a NULL pointer and perfrom the appropriatefailure or recovery action.",
