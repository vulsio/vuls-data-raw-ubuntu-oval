    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2.3. Out of bounds access exists in the functions ath6kl_wmi_pstream_timeout_event_rx and ath6kl_wmi_cac_event_rx in the file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c. It was discovered that the Atheros mobile chipset driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
