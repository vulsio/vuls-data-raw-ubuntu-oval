		"Description": "A missing CAP_NET_RAW check in NFC socket creation in net/nfc/rawsock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.2 could be used by local attackers to create raw sockets, bypassing security mechanisms, aka CID-26896f01467a. It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks when opening raw sockets. A local attacker could use this to create or listen to NFC traffic.",
