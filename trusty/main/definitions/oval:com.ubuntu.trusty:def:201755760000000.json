    "Title": "CVE-2017-5576 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Integer overflow in the vc4_get_bcl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/vc4_gem.c in the VideoCore DRM driver in the Linux kernel before 4.9.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted size value in a VC4_SUBMIT_CL ioctl call. Murray McAllister discovered that an integer overflow existed in the VideoCore DRM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5576` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
