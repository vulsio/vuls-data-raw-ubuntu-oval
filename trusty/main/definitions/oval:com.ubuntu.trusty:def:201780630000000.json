		"Title": "CVE-2017-8063 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/cxusb.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist. It was discovered that the Conexant USB driver in the Linux kernel improperly handled memory in some configurations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-8063` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
