		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: Fix loading 64-bit NOMMU kernels past the start of RAMcommit 3335068f8721 (\"riscv: Use PUD/P4D/PGD pages for the linearmapping\") added logic to allow using RAM below the kernel load address.However, this does not work for NOMMU, where PAGE_OFFSET is fixed to thekernel load address. Since that range of memory corresponds to PFNsbelow ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, mm initialization runs off the beginning ofmem_map and corrupts adjacent kernel memory. Fix this by restoring theprevious behavior for NOMMU kernels.",
