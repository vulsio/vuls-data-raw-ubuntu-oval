		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernelpointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transportstructure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem,the transport's handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfsfile system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. Whenread, the show_transport_handle function (indrivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle.This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in thekernel module's global variables.",
