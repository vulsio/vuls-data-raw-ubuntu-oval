		"description": "In Gradle from version 5.1 and before version 7.0 there is a vulnerabilitywhich can lead to information disclosure and/or dependency poisoning.Repository content filtering is a security control Gradle introduced tohelp users specify what repositories are used to resolve specificdependencies. This feature was introduced in the wake of the \"A ConfusingDependency\" blog post. In some cases, Gradle may ignore content filters andsearch all repositories for dependencies. This only occurs when repositorycontent filtering is used from within a `pluginManagement` block in asettings file. This may change how dependencies are resolved for Gradleplugins and build scripts. For builds that are vulnerable, there are tworisks: 1) Information disclosure: Gradle could make dependency requests torepositories outside your organization and leak internal packageidentifiers. 2) Dependency poisoning/Dependency confusion: Gradle coulddownload a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization dueto name squatting. For a full example and more details refer to thereferenced GitHub Security Advisory. The problem has been patched andreleased with Gradle 7.0. Users relying on this feature should upgradetheir build as soon as possible. As a workaround, users may use a companyrepository which has the right rules for fetching packages from publicrepositories, or use project level repository content filtering, inside`buildscript.repositories`. This option is available since Gradle 5.1 whenthe feature was introduced.",
