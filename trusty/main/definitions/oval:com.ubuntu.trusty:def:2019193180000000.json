    "Title": "CVE-2019-19318 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.3.11, mounting a crafted btrfs image twice can cause an rwsem_down_write_slowpath use-after-free because (in rwsem_can_spin_on_owner in kernel/locking/rwsem.c) rwsem_owner_flags returns an already freed pointer, It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate file system metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
