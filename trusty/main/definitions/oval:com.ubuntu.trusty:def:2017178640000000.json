    "Title": "CVE-2017-17864 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.8 mishandles states_equal comparisons between the pointer data type and the UNKNOWN_VALUE data type, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive address information, aka a \"pointer leak.\" Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation in the Linux kernel mishandled pointer data values in some situations. A local attacker could use this to to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-17864` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
