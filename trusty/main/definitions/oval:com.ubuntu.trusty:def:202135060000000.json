    "Title": "CVE-2021-3506 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in fs/f2fs/node.c in the f2fs module in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.12.0-rc4. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that an out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw existed in the f2fs module of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
