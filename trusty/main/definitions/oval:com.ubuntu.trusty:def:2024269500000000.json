		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peerThe previous commit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer->device beingdereferenced. It's actually easier and faster performance-wise toinstead get the device from ctx->wg. This semantically makes more sensetoo, since ctx->wg->peer_allowedips.seq is compared withctx->allowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx. This also acts as adefence in depth provision against freed peers.",
