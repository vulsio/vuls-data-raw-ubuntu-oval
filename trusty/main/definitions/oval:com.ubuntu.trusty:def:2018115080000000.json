    "Title": "CVE-2018-11508 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The compat_get_timex function in kernel/compat.c in the Linux kernel before 4.16.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via adjtimex. Jann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for 64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-11508` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
