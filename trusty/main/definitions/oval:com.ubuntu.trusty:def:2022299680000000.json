    "Title": "CVE-2022-29968 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.17.5. io_rw_init_file in fs/io_uring.c lacks initialization of kiocb->private. Joseph Ravichandran and Michael Wang discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
