		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/lima: fix shared irq handling on driver removelima uses a shared interrupt, so the interrupt handlers must be preparedto be called at any time. At driver removal time, the clocks aredisabled early and the interrupts stay registered until the very end ofthe remove process due to the devm usage.This is potentially a bug as the interrupts access device registerswhich assumes clocks are enabled. A crash can be triggered by removingthe driver in a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled.This patch frees the interrupts at each lima device finishing callbackso that the handlers are already unregistered by the time we fullydisable clocks.",
