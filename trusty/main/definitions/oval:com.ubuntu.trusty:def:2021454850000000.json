    "Title": "CVE-2021-45485 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3, net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information leak because of certain use of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that IPv6-based attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source addresses. Amit Klein discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel could disclose internal state in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
