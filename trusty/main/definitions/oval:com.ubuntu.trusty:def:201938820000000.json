		"Title": "CVE-2019-3882 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable. Alex Williamson discovered that the vfio subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly limit DMA mappings. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3882` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1045-azure - 4.15.0-1045.49~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1045-azure - 4.15.0-1045.49~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
