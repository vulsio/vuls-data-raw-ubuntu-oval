		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumptionGuenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11that had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then#DF from the stack guard.It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions onthe start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. Thisis true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.These assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leadingto a 'short' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has ashort copy of the entry text?Use the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignmentassumptions.",
