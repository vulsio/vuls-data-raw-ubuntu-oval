    "Title": "CVE-2022-25258 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur. It was discovered that the USB gadget subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate interface descriptor requests. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
