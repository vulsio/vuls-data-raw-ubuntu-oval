		"description": "OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system forLinux and other Unix-like operating systems. Starting in version 2.0.0 andprior to version 2.4.6, CUPS logs data of free memory to the loggingservice AFTER the connection has been closed, when it should have loggedthe data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entirecupsd process. The exact cause of this issue is the function`httpClose(con->http)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem isthat httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointerat the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer tohttpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` ifLogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookupfor the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) whichfails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and theconnection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and`/etc/hosts.deny`. Version 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",
