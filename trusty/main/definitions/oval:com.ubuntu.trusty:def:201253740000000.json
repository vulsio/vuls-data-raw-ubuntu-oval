    "Title": "CVE-2012-5374 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The CRC32C feature in the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.8-rc1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (extended runtime of kernel code) by creating many different files whose names are associated with the same CRC32C hash value. A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2012-5374` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required",
