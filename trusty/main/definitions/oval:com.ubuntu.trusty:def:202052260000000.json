		"description": "Cross-site scripting in SimpleSAMLphp before version 1.18.4. Thewww/erroreport.php script allows error reports to be submitted and sent tothe system administrator. Starting with SimpleSAMLphp 1.18.0, a newSimpleSAML\\Utils\\EMail class was introduced to handle sending emails,implemented as a wrapper of an external dependency. This new wrapper allowsus to use Twig templates in order to create the email sent with an errorreport. Since Twig provides automatic escaping of variables, manualescaping of the free-text field in www/errorreport.php was removed to avoiddouble escaping. However, for those not using the new user interface yet,an email template is hardcoded into the class itself in plain PHP. Since noescaping is provided in this template, it is then possible to inject HTMLinside the template by manually crafting the contents of the free-textfield.",
