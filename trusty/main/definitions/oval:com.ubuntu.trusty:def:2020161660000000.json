    "Title": "CVE-2020-16166 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel through 5.7.11 allows remote attackers to make observations that help to obtain sensitive information about the internal state of the network RNG, aka CID-f227e3ec3b5c. This is related to drivers/char/random.c and kernel/time/timer.c. It was discovered that the state of network RNG in the Linux kernel was potentially observable. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
