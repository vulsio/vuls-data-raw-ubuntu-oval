		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf:Fix racing between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free and bpf_timer_cancel Thefollowing race is possible between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free andbpf_timer_cancel. It will lead a UAF on the timer->timer.bpf_timer_cancel(); spin_lock(); t = timer->time; spin_unlock();bpf_timer_cancel_and_free(); spin_lock(); t = timer->timer; timer->timer =NULL; spin_unlock(); hrtimer_cancel(&t->timer); kfree(t); /* UAF on t */hrtimer_cancel(&t->timer); In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free, this patch freesthe timer->timer after a rcu grace period. This requires a rcu_headaddition to the \"struct bpf_hrtimer\". Another kfree(t) happens inbpf_timer_init, this does not need a kfree_rcu because it is still underthe spin_lock and timer->timer has not been visible by others yet. Inbpf_timer_cancel, rcu_read_lock() is added because this helper can be usedin a non rcu critical section context (e.g. from a sleepable bpf prog).Other timer->timer usages in helpers.c have been audited,bpf_timer_cancel() is the only place where timer->timer is used outside ofthe spin_lock. Another solution considered is to mark a t->flag inbpf_timer_cancel and clear it after hrtimer_cancel() is done. Inbpf_timer_cancel_and_free, it busy waits for the flag to be cleared beforekfree(t). This patch goes with a straight forward solution and freestimer->timer after a rcu grace period.",
