    "Title": "CVE-2021-20261 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernels implementation of the floppy disk drive controller driver software. The impact of this issue is lessened by the fact that the default permissions on the floppy device (/dev/fd0) are restricted to root. If the permissions on the device have changed the impact changes greatly. In the default configuration root (or equivalent) permissions are required to attack this flaw. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the floppy device driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with access to the floppy device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
