		"Title": "CVE-2020-29534 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.9.3. io_uring takes a non-refcounted reference to the files_struct of the process that submitted a request, causing execve() to incorrectly optimize unshare_fd(), aka CID-0f2122045b94. Jann Horn discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly escalate privileges.",
