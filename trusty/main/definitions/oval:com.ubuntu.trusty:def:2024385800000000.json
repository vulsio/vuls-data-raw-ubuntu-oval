		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: epoll:be better about file lifetimes epoll can call out to vfs_poll() with a filepointer that may race with the last 'fput()'. That would make f_count godown to zero, and while the ep->mtx locking means that the resulting filepointer tear-down will be blocked until the poll returns, it means thatf_count is already dead, and any use of it won't actually get a referenceto the file any more: it's dead regardless. Make sure we have a valid refon the file pointer before we call down to vfs_poll() from the epollroutines.",
