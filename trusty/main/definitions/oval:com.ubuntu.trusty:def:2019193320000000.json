		"Title": "CVE-2019-19332 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out-of-bounds memory write issue was found in the Linux Kernel, version 3.13 through 5.4, in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the 'KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID' ioctl(2) request to get CPUID features emulated by the KVM hypervisor. A user or process able to access the '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service. It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
