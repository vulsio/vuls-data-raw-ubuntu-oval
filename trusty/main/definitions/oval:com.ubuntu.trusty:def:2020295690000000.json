    "Title": "CVE-2020-29569 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used with Xen through 4.14.x. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback. Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered a race condition the Xen paravirt block backend in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS.",
