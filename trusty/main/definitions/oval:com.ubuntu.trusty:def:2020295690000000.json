		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used withXen through 4.14.x. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernelthread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, thehandler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles betweenthe states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend mayre-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This onlyaffects systems with a Linux blkback.",
