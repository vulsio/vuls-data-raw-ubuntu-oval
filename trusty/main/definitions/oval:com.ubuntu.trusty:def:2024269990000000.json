		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial/pmac_zilog: Remove flawed mitigation for rx irq flood The mitigationwas intended to stop the irq completely. That may be better than a hardlock-up but it turns out that you get a crash anyway if you're usingpmac_zilog as a serial console: ttyPZ0: pmz: rx irq flood ! BUG: spinlockrecursion on CPU#0, swapper/0 That's because the pr_err() call inpmz_receive_chars() results in pmz_console_write() attempting to lock aspinlock already locked in pmz_interrupt(). With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y,this produces a fatal BUG splat. The spinlock in question is the one instruct uart_port. Even when it's not fatal, the serial port rx functionceases to work. Also, the iteration limit doesn't play nicely with QEMU, ascan be seen in the bug report linked below. A web search for other reportsof the error message \"pmz: rx irq flood\" didn't produce anything. So Idon't think this code is needed any more. Remove it.",
