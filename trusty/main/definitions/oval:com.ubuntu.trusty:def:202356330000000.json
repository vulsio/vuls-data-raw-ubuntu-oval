    "Description": "The reference count changes made as part of the CVE-2023-33951 and CVE-2023-33952 fixes exposed a use-after-free flaw in the way memory objects were handled when they were being used to store a surface. When running inside a VMware guest with 3D acceleration enabled, a local, unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges. Murray McAllister discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle memory objects when storing surfaces, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
