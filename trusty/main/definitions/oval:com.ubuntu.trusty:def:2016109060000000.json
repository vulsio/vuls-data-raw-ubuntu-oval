		"Title": "CVE-2016-10906 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/arc/emac_main.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5. A use-after-free is caused by a race condition between the functions arc_emac_tx and arc_emac_tx_clean. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARC EMAC ethernet driver for the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
