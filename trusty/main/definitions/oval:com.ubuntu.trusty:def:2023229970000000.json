		"Title": "CVE-2023-22997 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.1.2, kernel/module/decompress.c misinterprets the module_get_next_page return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually an error pointer). It was discovered that the module decompression implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle return values in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
