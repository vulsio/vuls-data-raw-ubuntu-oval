		"Title": "CVE-2019-19064 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the fsl_lpspi_probe() function in drivers/spi/spi-fsl-lpspi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering pm_runtime_get_sync() failures, aka CID-057b8945f78f. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because an attacker cannot realistically control these failures at probe time. It was discovered that the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) driver in the Linux kernel device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
