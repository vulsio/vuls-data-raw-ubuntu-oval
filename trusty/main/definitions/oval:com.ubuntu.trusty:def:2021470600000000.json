		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM:Stop looking for coalesced MMIO zones if the bus is destroyed Abort thewalk of coalesced MMIO zones if kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev() fails toallocate memory for the new instance of the bus. If it can't instantiate anew bus, unregister_dev() destroys all devices _except_ the target device.But, it doesn't tell the caller that it obliterated the bus and invoked thedestructor for all devices that were on the bus. In the coalesced MMIOcase, this can result in a deleted list entry dereference due to attemptingto continue iterating on coalesced_zones after future entries (in the walk)have been deleted. Opportunistically add curly braces to the for-loop,which encompasses many lines but sneaks by without braces due to the gutsbeing a single if statement.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47060` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required",
