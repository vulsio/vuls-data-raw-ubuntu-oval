		"Title": "CVE-2016-9313 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "security/keys/big_key.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7 mishandles unsuccessful crypto registration in conjunction with successful key-type registration, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that uses the big_key data type. It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled crypto registration in conjunction with successful key- type registration. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
