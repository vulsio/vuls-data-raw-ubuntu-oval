    "Description": "A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function l2cap_recv_acldata of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211918 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the Bluetooth HCI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
