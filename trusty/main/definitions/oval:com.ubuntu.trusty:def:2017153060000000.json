    "Title": "CVE-2017-15306 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The kvm_vm_ioctl_check_extension function in arch/powerpc/kvm/powerpc.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION KVM_CAP_PPC_HTM ioctl call to /dev/kvm. It was discovered that a null pointer dereference error existed in the PowerPC KVM implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-15306` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
