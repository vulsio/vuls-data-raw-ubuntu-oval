		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:qat - resolve race condition during AER recovery During the PCI AERsystem's error recovery process, the kernel driver may encounter a racecondition with freeing the reset_data structure's memory. If the devicerestart will take more than 10 seconds the function scheduling that restartwill exit due to a timeout, and the reset_data structure will be freed.However, this data structure is used for completion notification after therestart is completed, which leads to a UAF bug. This results in a KFENCEbug notice. BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read inadf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat] Use-after-free read at0x00000000bc56fddf (in kfence-#142): adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0[intel_qat] process_one_work+0x173/0x340 To resolve this race condition,the memory associated to the container of the work_struct is freed on theworker if the timeout expired, otherwise on the function that schedules theworker. The timeout detection can be done by checking if the caller isstill waiting for completion or not by using completion_done() function.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-26974` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500 - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500mc - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-smp - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-emb - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-smp - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
