		"Title": "CVE-2023-0179 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow the leakage of both stack and heap addresses, and potentially allow Local Privilege Escalation to the root user via arbitrary code execution. Davide Ornaghi discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle VLAN headers in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
