    "Title": "CVE-2022-31607 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where a local user with basic capabilities can cause improper input validation, which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privileges, data tampering, and limited information disclosure. Le Wu discovered that the NVIDIA graphics drivers did not properly perform input validation in some situations. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
