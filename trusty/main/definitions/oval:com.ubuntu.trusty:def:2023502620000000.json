		"Title": "CVE-2023-50262 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter for PHP. When parsing SVG images Dompdfperforms an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG areallowed. One of the validations is that the SVG document does not referenceitself. However, prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive chained using two ormore SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the systemconfiguration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available tothe executing process and/or to the server itself.php-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support SVG references for`image` elements. However, when used in combination with Dompdf,php-svg-lib will process SVG images referenced by an `image` element.Dompdf currently includes validation to prevent self-referential `image`references, but a chained reference is not checked. A malicious actor maythus trigger infinite recursion by chaining references between two or moreSVG images.When Dompdf parses a malicious payload, it will crash due after exceedingthe allowed execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending multiplerequest to a system can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the pointthat the system is unable to handle incoming request.Version 2.0.4 contains a fix for this issue.",
