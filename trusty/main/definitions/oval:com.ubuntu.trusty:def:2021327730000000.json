		"Description": "Racket is a general-purpose programming language and an ecosystem forlanguage-oriented programming. In versions prior to 8.2, code evaluatedusing the Racket sandbox could cause system modules to incorrectly useattacker-created modules instead of their intended dependencies. This couldallow system functions to be controlled by the attacker, giving access tofacilities intended to be restricted. This problem is fixed in Racketversion 8.2. A workaround is available, depending on system settings. Forsystems that provide arbitrary Racket evaluation, external sandboxing suchas containers limit the impact of the problem. For multi-user evaluationsystems, such as the `handin-server` system, it is not possible to workaround this problem and upgrading is required.",
