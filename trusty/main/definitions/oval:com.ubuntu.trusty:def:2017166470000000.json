    "Title": "CVE-2017-16647 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "drivers/net/usb/asix_devices.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ASIX Ethernet USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle suspend and resume events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-16647` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
