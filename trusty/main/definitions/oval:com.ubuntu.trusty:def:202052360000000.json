		"description": "Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives a headerthat contains invalid characters. When a header like \"Bad-header:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\x10\" is received, it will cause the regular expressionengine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use 100% CPUtime and blocking any other interactions. This allows an attacker to send asingle request with an invalid header and take the service offline. Thisissue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression wasupdated to attempt to match the behaviour required by errata associatedwith RFC7230. The regular expression that is used to validate incomingheaders has been updated in version 1.4.3, it is recommended that peopleupgrade to the new version of Waitress as soon as possible.",
