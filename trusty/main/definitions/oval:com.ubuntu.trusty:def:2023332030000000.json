    "Title": "CVE-2023-33203 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before 6.2.9 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in drivers/net/ethernet/qualcomm/emac/emac.c if a physically proximate attacker unplugs an emac based device. It was discovered that the Qualcomm EMAC ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
