		"Title": "CVE-2020-25641 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs in versions before 5.9-rc7. A zero-length biovec request issued by the block subsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with basic privileges to issue requests to a block device, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length requests. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
