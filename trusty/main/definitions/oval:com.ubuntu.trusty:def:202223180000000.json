		"Title": "CVE-2022-2318 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "There are use-after-free vulnerabilities caused by timer handler in net/rose/rose_timer.c of linux that allow attackers to crash linux kernel without any privileges. Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling implementation of the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
