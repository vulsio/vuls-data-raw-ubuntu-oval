		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto:pcrypt - Fix hungtask for PADATA_RESET We found a hungtask bug intest_aead_vec_cfg as follows: INFO: task cryptomgr_test:391009 blocked formore than 120 seconds. \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\"disables this message.

In normalcase, aead_request_complete() will be called in pcrypt_aead_serial and thereturn err is 0 for padata_do_parallel. But, when pinst->flags isPADATA_RESET, the return err is -EBUSY for padata_do_parallel, and it won'tcall aead_request_complete(). Therefore, test_aead_vec_cfg will hung atwait_for_completion(&wait->completion), which will cause hungtask. Theproblem comes as following: (padata_do_parallel) | rcu_read_lock_bh(); |err = -EINVAL; | (padata_replace) | pinst->flags |= PADATA_RESET; err =-EBUSY | if (pinst->flags & PADATA_RESET) | rcu_read_unlock_bh() | returnerr In order to resolve the problem, we replace the return err -EBUSY with-EAGAIN, which means parallel_data is changing, and the caller should callit again. v3: remove retry and just change the return err. v2: introducepadata_try_do_parallel() in pcrypt_aead_encrypt and pcrypt_aead_decrypt tosolve the hungtask.",
