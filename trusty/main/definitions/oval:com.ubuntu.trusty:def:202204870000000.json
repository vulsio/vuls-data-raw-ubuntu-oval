    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. Zhihua Yao discovered that the MOXART SD/MMC driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
