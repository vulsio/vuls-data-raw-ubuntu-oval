    "Note": "seth-arnold> I'm marking this negligible because this feature seems doomed to failure in the general case. Any sort of memory-protection flaws in the target process, or ability to execute system calls directly, or programs that don't use the standard C libraries, etc. won't be affected by this feature. If you rely upon this feature I suggest instead seccomp2-based filters to disable the execve() and execveat() system calls at the kernel interface or AppArmor (or other MAC system) to restrict which executables can be executed."
