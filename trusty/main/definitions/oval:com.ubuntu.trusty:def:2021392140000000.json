		"Description": "mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. Inmitmproxy 7.0.2 and below, a malicious client or server is able to performHTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that amalicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxyas part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While a smuggledrequest is still captured as part of another request's body, it does notappear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxyevent hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checksor input sanitization. Unless one uses mitmproxy to protect an HTTP/1service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed inmitmproxy 7.0.3 and above.",
