One ofthe fixes regressed in that update was the fix for CVE-2016-9962, that waspreviously corrected in the docker packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7Extras via RHSA-2017:0116(https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0116). The CVE-2020-14300 wasassigned to this security regression and it is specific to the dockerpackages produced by Red Hat. The original issue - CVE-2016-9962 - couldpossibly allow a process inside container to compromise a process enteringcontainer namespace and execute arbitrary code outside of the container.This could lead to compromise of the container host or other containersrunning on the same container host. This issue only affects a singleversion of Docker, 1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30, shipped in Red Hat EnterpriseLinux 7. Both earlier and later versions are not affected.",
