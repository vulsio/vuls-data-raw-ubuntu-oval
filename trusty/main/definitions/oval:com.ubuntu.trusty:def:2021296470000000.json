    "Title": "CVE-2021-29647 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure, aka CID-50535249f624. It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
