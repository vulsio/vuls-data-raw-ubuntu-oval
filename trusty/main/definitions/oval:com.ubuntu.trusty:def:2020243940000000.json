    "Title": "CVE-2020-24394 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.7.8, fs/nfsd/vfs.c (in the NFS server) can set incorrect permissions on new filesystem objects when the filesystem lacks ACL support, aka CID-22cf8419f131. This occurs because the current umask is not considered. It was discovered that the NFS server implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly honor umask settings when setting permissions while creating file system objects if the underlying file system did not support ACLs. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or violate system integrity.",
