		"description": "In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which wasproperly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to theearlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that waspotentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed bybackporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnectionand re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-freeconditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilegeescalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before4.14.139.",
