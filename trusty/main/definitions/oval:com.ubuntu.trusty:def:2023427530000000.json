    "Title": "CVE-2023-42753 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate array offsets, leading to a out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
