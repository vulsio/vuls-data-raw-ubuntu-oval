		"title": "CVE-2021-3653 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high",
		"description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nestedvirtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machinecontrol block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest(L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue couldallow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual InterruptController) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed toread/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entiresystem, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flawaffects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3653` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-214-generic - 4.4.0-214.246~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-214-generic - 4.4.0-214.246~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-214-lowlatency - 4.4.0-214.246~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1096-aws - 4.4.0-1096.101\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1123-azure - 4.15.0-1123.136~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
