		"Title": "CVE-2021-3653 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nestedvirtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machinecontrol block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest(L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue couldallow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual InterruptController) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed toread/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entiresystem, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flawaffects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.",
