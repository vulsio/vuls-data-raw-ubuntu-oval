		"Title": "CVE-2021-4157 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An out of memory bounds write flaw (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in the way users use mirroring (replication of files with NFS). A user, having access to the NFS mount, could potentially use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system. It was discovered that the Parallel NFS (pNFS) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
