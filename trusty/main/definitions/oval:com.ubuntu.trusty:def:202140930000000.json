    "Title": "CVE-2021-4093 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting the Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES). A KVM guest using SEV-ES can trigger out-of-bounds reads and writes in the host kernel via a malicious VMGEXIT for a string I/O instruction (for example, outs or ins) using the exit reason SVM_EXIT_IOIO. This issue results in a crash of the entire system or a potential guest-to-host escape scenario. Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle exit events from AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) guest VMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host kernel.",
