		"title": "CVE-2017-1000111 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high",
		"description": "Linux kernel: heap out-of-bounds in AF_PACKET sockets. This new issue isanalogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a socketoption that changes socket state may race with safety checks inpacket_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time withPACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the update.This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further. As thisissue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the processnamespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any process cancreate a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000111` to fix the vulnerability.
