    "Description": "rtw_wx_set_scan in drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/ioctl_linux.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.6 allows writing beyond the end of the ->ssid[] array. NOTE: from the perspective of kernel.org releases, CVE IDs are not normally used for drivers/staging/* (unfinished work); however, system integrators may have situations in which a drivers/staging issue is relevant to their own customer base. It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
