    "Title": "CVE-2018-13098 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (slab out-of-bounds read and BUG) can occur for a modified f2fs filesystem image in which FI_EXTRA_ATTR is set in an inode. Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
