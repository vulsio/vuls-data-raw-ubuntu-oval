		"Title": "CVE-2020-29660 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID, aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24. Jann Horn discovered that the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel did not use consistent locking in some situations, leading to a read-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
