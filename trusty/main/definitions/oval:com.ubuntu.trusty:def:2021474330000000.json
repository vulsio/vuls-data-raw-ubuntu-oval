		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix abort logic in btrfs_replace_file_extentsError injection testing uncovered a case where we'd end up with acorrupt file system with a missing extent in the middle of a file.  Thisoccurs because the if statement to decide if we should abort is wrong.The only way we would abort in this case is if we got a ret !=-EOPNOTSUPP and we called from the file clone code.  However theprealloc code uses this path too.  Instead we need to abort if there isan error, and the only error we _don't_ abort on is -EOPNOTSUPP and onlyif we came from the clone file code.",
