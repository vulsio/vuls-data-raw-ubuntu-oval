		"Title": "CVE-2021-3483 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Nosy driver in the Linux kernel. This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions before kernel 5.12-rc6 are affected 马哲宇 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
