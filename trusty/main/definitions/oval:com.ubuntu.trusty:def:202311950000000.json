		"Title": "CVE-2023-1195 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in reconn_set_ipaddr_from_hostname in fs/cifs/connect.c in the Linux kernel. The issue occurs when it forgets to set the free pointer server->hostname to NULL, leading to an invalid pointer request. It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a user-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
