		"Title": "CVE-2021-4203 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free read flaw was found in sock_getsockopt() in net/core/sock.c due to SO_PEERCRED and SO_PEERGROUPS race with listen() (and connect()) in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, an attacker with a user privileges may crash the system or leak internal kernel information. Jann Horn discovered that the socket subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling listen() and connect() operations, leading to a read-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
