		"Description": "Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.3 are vulnerable to CSRFattacks through CORS preflight requests that target Spring MVC(spring-webmvc module) or Spring WebFlux (spring-webflux module) endpoints.Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because preflight requestsshould not include credentials and therefore requests should failauthentication. However a notable exception to this are Chrome basedbrowsers when using client certificates for authentication since Chromesends TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests in violation ofspec requirements. No HTTP body can be sent or received as a result of thisattack.",
