		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: batman-adv: fix error handlingSyzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem wasin wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in caseof any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, whenthere is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv areinitialized; but there isn't any.All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hideODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hitGPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handlingpath 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneededbatadv_*_free() functions.So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memorybefore returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touchinguninitialized fields.",
