		"description": "When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured touse an ACL file, and that ACL file is empty, or contains only comments orblank lines, then Mosquitto will treat this as though no ACL file has beendefined and use a default allow policy. The new behaviour is to have anempty ACL file mean that all access is denied, which is not a usefulconfiguration but is not unexpected.",
