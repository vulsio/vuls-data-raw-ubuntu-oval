		"Title": "CVE-2019-19048 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A memory leak in the crypto_reportstat() function in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_utils.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering copy_form_user() failures, aka CID-e0b0cb938864. It was discovered that the VirtualBox guest driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
