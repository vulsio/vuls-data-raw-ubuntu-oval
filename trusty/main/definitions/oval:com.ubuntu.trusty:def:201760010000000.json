    "Title": "CVE-2017-6001 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Race condition in kernel/events/core.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.7 allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application that makes concurrent perf_event_open system calls for moving a software group into a hardware context.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-6786. Di Shen discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly gain administrative privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-6001` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-lowlatency - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-lowlatency - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
