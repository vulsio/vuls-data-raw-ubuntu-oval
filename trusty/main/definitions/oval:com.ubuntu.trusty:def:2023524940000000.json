		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bus:mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointer Though we docheck the event ring read pointer by \"is_valid_ring_ptr\" to make sure it isin the buffer range, but there is another risk the pointer may be notaligned. Since we are expecting event ring elements are 128 bits(structmhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer could lead to multipleissues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption. So add a alignment checkfor event ring read pointer.",
