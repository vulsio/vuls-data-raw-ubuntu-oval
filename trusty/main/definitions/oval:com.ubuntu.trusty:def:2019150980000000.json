    "Description": "drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9 has a NULL pointer dereference via an incomplete address in an endpoint descriptor. Hui Peng discovered that the Atheros AR6004 USB Wi-Fi device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint descriptors returned by the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
