		"description": "When using the CAS Proxy ticket authentication from Spring Security 3.1 to3.2.4 a malicious CAS Service could trick another CAS Service intoauthenticating a proxy ticket that was not associated. This is due to thefact that the proxy ticket authentication uses the information from theHttpServletRequest which is populated based upon untrusted informationwithin the HTTP request. This means if there are access controlrestrictions on which CAS services can authenticate to one another, thoserestrictions can be bypassed. If users are not using CAS Proxy tickets andnot basing access control decisions based upon the CAS Service, then thereis no impact to users.",
