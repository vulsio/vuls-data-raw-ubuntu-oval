    "Title": "CVE-2019-17133 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.3.2, cfg80211_mgd_wext_giwessid in net/wireless/wext-sme.c does not reject a long SSID IE, leading to a Buffer Overflow. Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
