There is initially incorrect access control, later followedby an expired pointer dereference. One attack vector is sending anuntrusted client certificate during EAP-TLS. A server is affected only ifit loads plugins that implement TLS-based EAP methods (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS,EAP-PEAP, or EAP-TNC). This is fixed in 5.9.10.",
