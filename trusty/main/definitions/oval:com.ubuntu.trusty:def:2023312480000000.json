		"Description": "Linux Kernel nftables Use-After-Free Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability; `nft_chain_lookup_byid()` failed to check whether a chain was active and CAP_NET_ADMIN is in any user or network namespace Mingi Cho discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the status of a nft chain while performing a lookup by id, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
