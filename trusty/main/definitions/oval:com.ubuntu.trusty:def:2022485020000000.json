    "Title": "CVE-2022-48502 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.2. The ntfs3 subsystem does not properly check for correctness during disk reads, leading to an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_set_ea in fs/ntfs3/xattr.c. It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
