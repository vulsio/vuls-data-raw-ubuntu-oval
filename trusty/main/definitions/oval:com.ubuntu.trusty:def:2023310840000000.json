		"Title": "CVE-2023-31084 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(&fepriv->sem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(&fepriv->sem) may block the process. It was discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking events in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).",
