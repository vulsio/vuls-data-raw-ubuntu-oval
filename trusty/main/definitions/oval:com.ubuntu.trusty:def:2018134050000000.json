		"title": "CVE-2018-13405 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through3.16 allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership,in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writableby a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the non-member cantrigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. Theintended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of adirectory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. Thenon-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable andSGID.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-13405` to fix the vulnerability.
