		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: protect references to superblock parameters exposed in sysfsThe superblock buffers of nilfs2 can not only be overwritten at runtimefor modifications/repairs, but they are also regularly swapped, replacedduring resizing, and even abandoned when degrading to one side due tobacking device issues.  So, accessing them requires mutual exclusion usingthe reader/writer semaphore \"nilfs->ns_sem\".Some sysfs attribute show methods read this superblock buffer without thenecessary mutual exclusion, which can cause problems with pointerdereferencing and memory access, so fix it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-46780` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500 - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500mc - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-smp - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-emb - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-smp - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
