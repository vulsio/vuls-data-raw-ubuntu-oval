		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media:rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue In rkisp1_isp_stop() andrkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks the interrupts and then apparentlyassumes that the interrupt handler won't be running, and proceeds in thestop procedure. This is not the case, as the interrupt handler can alreadybe running, which would lead to the ISP being disabled while the interrupthandler handling a captured frame. This brings up two issues: 1) the ISPcould be powered off while the interrupt handler is still running andaccessing registers, leading to board lockup, and 2) the interrupt handlercode and the code that disables the streaming might do things thatconflict. It is not clear to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can beseen with a suitable delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler,leading to board lockup.",
