		"Title": "CVE-2019-12380 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
		"Description": "**DISPUTED** An issue was discovered in the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. phys_efi_set_virtual_address_map in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi_call_phys_prolog in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures. NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “All the code touched by the referenced commit runs only at boot, before any user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it.”. It was discovered that the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel did not handle memory allocation failures during early boot in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
