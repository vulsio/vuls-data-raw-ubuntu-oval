		"description": "GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a defaultencryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This meansanyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible tochange the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data mustbe reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columnsor rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changingthe key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi;but storing them again from the UI will work.",
