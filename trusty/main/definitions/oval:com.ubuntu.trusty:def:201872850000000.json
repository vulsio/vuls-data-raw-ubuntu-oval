		"description": "A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1.The RTP support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic codecsand desired payload numbers. While an SDP negotiation may result in a codecusing a different payload number, these desired ones are still storedinternally. When an RTP packet was received, this registry would beconsulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP. Thisregistry was incorrectly consulted for all packets, even those which aredynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different type thanthe RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in a video codecbut the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of thattype had been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly assumingthat a stream of that type would always exist.",
