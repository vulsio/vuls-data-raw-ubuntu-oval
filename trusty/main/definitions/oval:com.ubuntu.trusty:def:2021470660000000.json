		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:async_xor: increase src_offs when dropping destination page Now we supportsharing one page if PAGE_SIZE is not equal stripe size. To support this, itneeds to support calculating xor value with different offsets for eachr5dev. One offset array is used to record those offsets. In RMW mode,parity page is used as a source page. It sets ASYNC_TX_XOR_DROP_DST beforecalculating xor value in ops_run_prexor5. So it needs to add src_list andsrc_offs at the same time. Now it only needs src_list. So the xor valuewhich is calculated is wrong. It can cause data corruption problem. I canreproduce this problem 100% on a POWER8 machine. The steps are: mdadm -CR/dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --size=3G mkfs.xfs /dev/md0mount /dev/md0 /mnt/test mount: /mnt/test: mount(2) system call failed:Structure needs cleaning.",
