		"Title": "CVE-2023-32248 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2_TREE_CONNECT and SMB2_QUERY_INFO commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a pointer prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Quentin Minster discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate pointers in some situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
