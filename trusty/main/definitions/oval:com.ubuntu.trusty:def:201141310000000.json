		"Title": "CVE-2011-4131 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The NFSv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.2 does not properly handle bitmap sizes in GETACL replies, which allows remote NFS servers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) by sending an excessive number of bitmap words. Andy Adamson discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's NFSv4 implementation. A remote NFS server (attacker) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2011-4131` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.4.0-1-flo - 3.4.0-1.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.4.0-1-goldfish - 3.4.0-1.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.4.0-3-mako - 3.4.0-3.21\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.4.0-4-manta - 3.4.0-4.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required",
