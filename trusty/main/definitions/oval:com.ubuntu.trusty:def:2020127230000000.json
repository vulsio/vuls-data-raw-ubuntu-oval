		"description": "regcomp.c in Perl before 5.30.3 allows a buffer overflow via a craftedregular expression because of recursive S_study_chunk calls. An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this usage scenario.]",
