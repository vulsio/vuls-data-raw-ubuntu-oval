		"title": "CVE-2022-1343 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSPresponse. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is usedthen the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) evenin the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It isanticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use theOCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function willreturn a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of acertificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in thiscase would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL \"ocsp\"application. When verifying an ocsp response with the \"-no_cert_checks\"option the command line application will report that the verification issuccessful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrectsuccessful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing thefailure and contradicting the apparently successful result. Fixed inOpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).",
