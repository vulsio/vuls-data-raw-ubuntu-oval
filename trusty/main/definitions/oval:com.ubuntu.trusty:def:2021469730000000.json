		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net:qrtr: Avoid potential use after free in MHI send It is possible that theMHI ul_callback will be invoked immediately following the queueing of theskb for transmission, leading to the callback decrementing the refcount ofthe associated sk and freeing the skb. As such the dereference of skb andthe increment of the sk refcount must happen before the skb is queued, toavoid the skb to be used after free and potentially the sk to drop its lastrefcount..",
