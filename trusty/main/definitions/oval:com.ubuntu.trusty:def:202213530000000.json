		"Title": "CVE-2022-1353 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. It was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
