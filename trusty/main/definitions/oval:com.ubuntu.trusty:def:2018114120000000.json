    "Title": "CVE-2018-11412 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel 4.13 through 4.16.11, ext4_read_inline_data() in fs/ext4/inline.c performs a memcpy with an untrusted length value in certain circumstances involving a crafted filesystem that stores the system.data extended attribute value in a dedicated inode. Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-11412` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
