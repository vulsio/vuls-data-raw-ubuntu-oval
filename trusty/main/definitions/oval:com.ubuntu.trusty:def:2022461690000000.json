		"description": "Cacti is an open source platform which provides a robust and extensibleoperational monitoring and fault management framework for users. Inaffected versions a command injection vulnerability allows anunauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti,if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. Thevulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can beaccessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address ofthe client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to thecorresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified thatan entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname correspondsto the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns`true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed dueto the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function isdefined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER`variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variablesbeginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since thereis a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the serverrunning Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providingthe header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function`get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. Thefollowing call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to thehostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check becauseof the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php`file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of theseactions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrievesa few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entriesfrom the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals`POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute aPHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved viathe function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings.This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`,which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the`poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach thevulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`,where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to`POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and`local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a`poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This isvery likely on a productive instance because this action is added by somepredefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`.This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user toexecute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type`POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypassshould be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr`(file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could bedone by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these shouldbe kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fakethe IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has beenaddressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` beingthe first release containing the patch.",
