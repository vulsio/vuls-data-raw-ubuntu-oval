		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/prime: Fix use after free in mmap with drm_gem_ttm_mmapdrm_gem_ttm_mmap() drops a reference to the gem object on success. Ifthe gem object's refcount == 1 on entry to drm_gem_prime_mmap(), thatdrop will free the gem object, and the subsequent drm_gem_object_get()will be a UAF. Fix by grabbing a reference before calling the mmaphelper.This issue was forseen when the reference dropping was adding incommit 9786b65bc61ac (\"drm/ttm: fix mmap refcounting\"):  \"For that to work properly the drm_gem_object_get() call in  drm_gem_ttm_mmap() must be moved so it happens before calling  obj->funcs->mmap(), otherwise the gem refcount would go down  to zero.\"",
