		"Title": "CVE-2020-26212 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a FreeAsset and IT Management Software package, that provides ITIL Service Deskfeatures, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI before version9.5.3, any authenticated user has read-only permissions to the planning ofevery other user, even admin ones. Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1.Create a new planning with 'eduardo.mozart' user (from 'IT' group thatbelongs to 'Super-admin') into it's personal planning at 'Assistance' >'Planning'. 2. Copy the CalDAV url and use a CalDAV client (e.g.Thunderbird) to sync the planning with the provided URL. 3. Inform theusername and password from any valid user (e.g. 'camila' from 'Proativa'group). 4. 'Camila' has read-only access to 'eduardo.mozart' personalplanning. The same behavior happens to any group. E.g. 'Camila' has accessto 'IT' group planning, even if she doesn't belong to this group and has a'Self-service' profile permission). This issue is fixed in version 9.5.3.As a workaround, one can remove the `caldav.php` file to block access toCalDAV server.",
