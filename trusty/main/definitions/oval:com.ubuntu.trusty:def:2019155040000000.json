    "Description": "drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi_91x_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9 has a Double Free via crafted USB device traffic (which may be remote via usbip or usbredir). Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions on initialization, leading to a double-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
