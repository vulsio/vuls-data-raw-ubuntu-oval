		"Title": "CVE-2020-8625 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and areconfigured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND'sdefault settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server canbe rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for thetkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Althoughthe default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used innetworks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-serverenvironments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domaincontrollers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of thevulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote codeexecution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0-> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also releaseversions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch",
