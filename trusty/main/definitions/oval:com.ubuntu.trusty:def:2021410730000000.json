    "Title": "CVE-2021-41073 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "loop_rw_iter in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel 5.10 through 5.14.6 allows local users to gain privileges by using IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS to trigger a free of a kernel buffer, as demonstrated by using /proc/<pid>/maps for exploitation. Valentina Palmiotti discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel could be coerced to free adjacent memory. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code.",
