		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.6.1, drivers/media/usb/gspca/xirlink_cit.c (aka the Xirlink camera USB driver) mishandles invalid descriptors, aka CID-a246b4d54770. It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
