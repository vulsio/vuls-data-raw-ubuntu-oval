    "Title": "CVE-2020-10942 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.5.8, get_raw_socket in drivers/vhost/net.c lacks validation of an sk_family field, which might allow attackers to trigger kernel stack corruption via crafted system calls. It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl() calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
