		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc3: core: Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address accessThis commit addresses an issue where the USB core could access aninvalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially causingSMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problemarises from the following sequence.        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the        run/stop bit by software.        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of        the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event        buffer address.To prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensuresthat the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USBcore is active during runtime suspend by checking its status beforeclearing the buffer address.",
