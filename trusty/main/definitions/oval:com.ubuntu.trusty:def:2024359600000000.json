		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Properly link new fs rules into the tree Previously, add_rule_fgwould only add newly created rules from the handle into the tree when theyhad a refcount of 1. On the other hand, create_flow_handle tries hard tofind and reference already existing identical rules instead of creating newones. These two behaviors can result in a situation wherecreate_flow_handle 1) creates a new rule and references it, then 2) in asubsequent step during the same handle creation references it again,resulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the tree,will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when the flowgroup is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule deletion, assumesnode->parent is != NULL. This happened in the wild, due to another bugrelated to incorrect handling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead tothe code in create_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule inthe same flow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Fulldetails are at [1]. This patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules withoutparents into the tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash.This makes it more consistent with how rules are added to an FTE increate_flow_handle.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-35960` to fix the vulnerability.
