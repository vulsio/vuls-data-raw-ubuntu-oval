		"description": "USN-4971-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in libwebp. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that libwebp incorrectly handled certain malformed  images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially  crafted image file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause libwebp  to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary  code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4971-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libwebp5 - 0.4.0-4ubuntu0.1~esm1 webp - 0.4.0-4ubuntu0.1~esm1 libwebpdemux1 - 0.4.0-4ubuntu0.1~esm1 libwebp-dev - 0.4.0-4ubuntu0.1~esm1 libwebpmux1 - 0.4.0-4ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
