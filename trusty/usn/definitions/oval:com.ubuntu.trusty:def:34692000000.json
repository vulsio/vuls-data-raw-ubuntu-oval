		"description": "USN-3469-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  Anthony Perard discovered that the Xen virtual block driver did not properly initialize some data structures before passing them to user space. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2017-10911)  Bo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain requests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)  It was discovered that the nested KVM implementation in the Linux kernel in some situations did not properly prevent second level guests from reading and writing the hardware CR8 register. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).  It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12192)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the sysfs interface for the QLogic 24xx+ series SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14051)  It was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-14156)  Dave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not enforce that the realtime inode flag was settable only on filesystems on a realtime device. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14340)  ChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)  It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data returned to user space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-14991)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Floating Point Unit (fpu) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle attempts to set reserved bits in a task's extended state (xstate) area. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-15537)  Pengfei Wang discovered that the Turtle Beach MultiSound audio device driver in the Linux kernel contained race conditions when fetching from the ring-buffer. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2017-9984, CVE-2017-9985)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3469-2` to fix the vulnerability.
