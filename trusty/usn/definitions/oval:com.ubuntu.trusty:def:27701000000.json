(CVE-2015-6755)  A use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6757)  It was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of LocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

(CVE-2015-6763)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
