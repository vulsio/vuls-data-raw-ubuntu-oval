		"description": "USN-2232-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The upstream fix for CVE-2014-0224 caused a regression for certain applications that use tls_session_secret_cb, such as wpa_supplicant. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Jüri Aedla discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled invalid DTLS  fragments. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to  crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary  code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0195)    Imre Rad discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled DTLS recursions. A  remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting  in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0221)    KIKUCHI Masashi discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain  handshakes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a  machine-in-the-middle attack and possibly decrypt and modify traffic.  (CVE-2014-0224)    Felix Gröbert and Ivan Fratrić discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled  anonymous ECDH ciphersuites. A remote attacker could use this issue to  cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only  affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  (CVE-2014-3470)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2232-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.3 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.3 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.3 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.3 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.3 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.3 No subscription required",
