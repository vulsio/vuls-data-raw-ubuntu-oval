		"description": "Marcus Brinkmann discovered that during decryption or verification, GnuPG did not properly filter out terminal sequences when reporting the original filename. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file that would cause an application parsing GnuPG output to incorrectly interpret the status of the cryptographic operation reported by GnuPG. (CVE-2018-12020)  Lance Vick discovered that GnuPG did not enforce configurations where key certification required an offline primary Certify key. An attacker with access to a signing subkey could generate certifications that appeared to be valid. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-9234)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3675-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  gnupg-curl - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.5 gnupg-udeb - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.5 gpgv - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.5 gnupg - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.5 gpgv-udeb - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.5 No subscription required",
