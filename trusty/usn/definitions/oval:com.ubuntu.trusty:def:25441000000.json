		"description": "Eric Windisch discovered flaw in how the Linux kernel's XFS file system replaces remote attributes. A local access with access to an XFS file system could exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2015-0274)  A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-7421)  The Linux kernel's splice system call did not correctly validate its parameters. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-7822)  A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-9644)  Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) failed to verify symlink size info. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. (CVE-2014-9728)  Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) did not valid inode size information . A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. (CVE-2014-9729)  Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) did not correctly verify the component length for symlinks. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. (CVE-2014-9730)  Carl H Lunde discovered an information leak in the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS). A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to read potential sensitve kernel memory. (CVE-2014-9731)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2544-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-3.13.0-48-generic - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-generic - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-lowlatency - 3.13.0-48.80 linux-image-3.13.0-48-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-48.80 No subscription required",
