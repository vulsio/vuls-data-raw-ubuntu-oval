		"description": "Gustavo Grieco discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library did not properly handle scaling tga image files, leading to a heap overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a tga image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-7673)  Gustavo Grieco discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an integer overflow when handling certain GIF images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a GIF image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-7674)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2767-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 - 2.30.7-0ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-common - 2.30.7-0ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev - 2.30.7-0ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0-udeb - 2.30.7-0ubuntu1.2 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-doc - 2.30.7-0ubuntu1.2 gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0 - 2.30.7-0ubuntu1.2 No subscription required",
