		"title": "USN-4095-2 -- Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "USN-4095-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-5383)  It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-10126)  Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-1125)  It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-11833)  It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-12614)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel on ARM processors allowed a tracing process to modify a syscall after a seccomp decision had been made on that syscall. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass seccomp restrictions. (CVE-2019-2054)  It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3846)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4095-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1050-aws - 4.4.0-1050.54 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-4.4.0-159-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-159.187~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-159-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-159.187~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-159-lowlatency - 4.4.0-159.187~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-159-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-159.187~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-159-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-159.187~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-159-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-159.187~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-159-generic - 4.4.0-159.187~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1050.51 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-powerpc-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 linux-image-powerpc64-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 linux-image-powerpc64-emb-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 linux-image-powerpc-e500mc-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.159.140 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
