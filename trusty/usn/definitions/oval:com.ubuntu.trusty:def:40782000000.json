Original advisory details:   It was discovered that OpenLDAP incorrectly handled rootDN delegation. A  database administrator could use this issue to request authorization as an  identity from another database, contrary to expectations. (CVE-2019-13057)   It was discovered that OpenLDAP incorrectly handled SASL authentication and  session encryption. After a first SASL bind was completed, it was possible  to obtain access by performing simple binds, contrary to expectations.
