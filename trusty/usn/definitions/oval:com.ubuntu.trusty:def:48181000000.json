		"description": "It was discovered that OpenCV did not properly manage certain objects, leading to a divide-by-zero. If a user were tricked into loading a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could potentially use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15939)  It was discovered that OpenCV did not properly manage certain files, leading to an out of bounds read. If a user were tricked into loading a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could potentially use this issue to make OpenCV crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-14491, CVE-2019-14492)  It was discovered that OpenCV did not properly manage certain XML data, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. If a user were tricked into loading a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could potentially use this issue to make OpenCV crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-14493)  It was discovered that OpenCV did not properly manage certain files, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. If a user were tricked into loading a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could potentially use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2017-18009)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4818-1` to fix the vulnerability.
