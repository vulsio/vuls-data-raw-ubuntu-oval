		"description": "USN-3265-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  It was discovered that a use-after-free flaw existed in the filesystem encryption subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-7374)  Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds access in the IPv6 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunneling implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-5897)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle invalid IP options in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5970)  Gareth Evans discovered that the shm IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict mapping page zero. A local privileged attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5669)  Alexander Popov discovered that a race condition existed in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-5986)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle TCP packets with the URG flag. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-6214)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the LLC subsytem in the Linux kernel did not properly set up a destructor in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-6345)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the AF_PACKET handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-6346)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IP layer in the Linux kernel made improper assumptions about internal data layout when performing checksums. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-6347)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Infrared (IrDA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (deadlock). (CVE-2017-6348)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3265-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-75-generic - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-75-generic - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-75-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-75-lowlatency - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-75-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-75.96~14.04.1 No subscription required",
