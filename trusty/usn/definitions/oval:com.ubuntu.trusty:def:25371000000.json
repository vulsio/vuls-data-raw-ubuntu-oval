		"description": "It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed EC private key files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0209)  Stephen Henson discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled comparing ASN.1 boolean types. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0286)  Emilia Käsper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN.1 structure reuse. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0287)  Brian Carpenter discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled invalid certificate keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0288)  Michal Zalewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled missing outer ContentInfo when parsing PKCS#7 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0289)  Robert Dugal and David Ramos discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled decoding Base64 encoded data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0292)  Sean Burford and Emilia Käsper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled specially crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2537-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11 No subscription required",
