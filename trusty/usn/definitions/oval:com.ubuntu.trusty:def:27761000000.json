		"title": "USN-2776-1 -- Linux kernel vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0272)  It was discovered that virtio networking in the Linux kernel did not handle fragments correctly, leading to kernel memory corruption. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-5156)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify sockets were properly bound before attempting to send a message, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-6937)  Ben Hutchings discovered that the Advanced Union Filesystem (aufs) for the Linux kernel did not correctly handle references of memory mapped files from an aufs mount. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-7312)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2776-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-3.13.0-66-generic - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-3.13.0-66-lowlatency - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-3.13.0-66-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-66-generic - 3.13.0-66.108 linux-image-3.13.0-66-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-66.108 No subscription required",
