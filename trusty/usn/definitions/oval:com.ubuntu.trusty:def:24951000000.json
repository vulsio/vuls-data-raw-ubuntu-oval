		"description": "A use-after-free bug was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1209)  It was discovered that V8 did not properly consider frame access restrictions when throwing exceptions in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-1210)  It was discovered that Chromium did not properly restrict the URI scheme during ServiceWorker registration. If a user were tricked in to downloading and opening a specially crafted HTML file, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. (CVE-2015-1211)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
