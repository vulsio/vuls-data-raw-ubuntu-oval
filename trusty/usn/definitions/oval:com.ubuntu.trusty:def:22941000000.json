An attacker could exploit this with specially crafted ASN.1 data and cause applications using Libtasn1 to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3467)  It was discovered that Libtasn1 incorrectly handled negative bit lengths. An attacker could exploit this with specially crafted ASN.1 data and cause applications using Libtasn1 to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)  It was discovered that Libtasn1 incorrectly handled certain ASN.1 data.
