		"description": "USN-3675-1 fixed a vulnerability in GnuPG 2 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10. This update provides the corresponding update for GnuPG 2 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  Original advisory details:   Marcus Brinkmann discovered that during decryption or verification,  GnuPG did not properly filter out terminal sequences when reporting the  original filename. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file  that would cause an application parsing GnuPG output to incorrectly  interpret the status of the cryptographic operation reported by GnuPG.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3675-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  gpgsm - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.4 gnupg-agent - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.4 gnupg2 - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.4 scdaemon - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.4 gpgv2 - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.4 No subscription required",
