		"description": "Jan Beulich discovered that the KVM svm hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly catch Debug exceptions on AMD processors. An attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2015-8104)  郭永刚 discovered that the ppp implementation in the Linux kernel did not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid. A local attacker with the privilege to call ioctl() on /dev/ppp could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7799)  It was discovered that the virtual video osd test driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data structures. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel. (CVE-2015-7884)  It was discovered that the driver for Digi Neo and ClassicBoard devices did not properly initialize data structures. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel. (CVE-2015-7885)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2842-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.19.0-41-powerpc64-emb - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 linux-image-3.19.0-41-generic - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 linux-image-3.19.0-41-powerpc64-smp - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 linux-image-3.19.0-41-powerpc-e500mc - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 linux-image-3.19.0-41-lowlatency - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 linux-image-3.19.0-41-generic-lpae - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 linux-image-3.19.0-41-powerpc-smp - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 linux-image-extra-3.19.0-41-generic - 3.19.0-41.46~14.04.2 No subscription required",
