		"description": "It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to guarantee that allocated memory space existed, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0907, CVE-2022-0908)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to avoid division calculations where the denominator value was zero, which could lead to an undefined behavior situation via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0909)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing bounds checks, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0924)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing the calculation of data that would eventually be used as a reference for bounds checking operations, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-19131)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly terminating a function execution when processing incorrect data, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-19144)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks when setting the value for data later used as reference during memory access, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-22844)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5523-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libtiff-opengl - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 libtiffxx5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 libtiff5-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 libtiff4-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 libtiff5-alt-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 libtiff5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 libtiff-tools - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 libtiff-doc - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
