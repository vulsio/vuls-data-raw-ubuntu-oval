		"description": "Aleksis Kauppinen discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain remote config packets. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5146)  Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logconfig directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5194)  Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain statistics types. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5195)  Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain file paths. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or overwrite certain files. (CVE-2015-5196, CVE-2015-7703)  Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5219)  Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP incorrectly handled restarting after hitting a panic threshold. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to alter the system time on clients. (CVE-2015-5300)  It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled autokey data packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702)  It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled memory when processing certain autokey messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7701)  Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP incorrectly handled rate limiting. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause clients to stop updating their clock. (CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705)  Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logfile and keyfile directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to enter a loop, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7850)  Yves Younan and Aleksander Nikolich discovered that NTP incorrectly handled ascii conversion. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-7852)  Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled reference clock memory. A malicious refclock could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-7853)  John D \"Doug\" Birdwell discovered that NTP incorrectly handled decoding certain bogus values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7855)  Stephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled symmetric association authentication. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly bypass authentication and alter the system clock. (CVE-2015-7871)  In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the NTP AppArmor profile.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2783-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ntp - 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.5 ntp-doc - 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.5 ntpdate - 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.5 No subscription required",
