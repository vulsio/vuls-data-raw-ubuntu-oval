		"description": "It was discovered that an out of bounds read vulnerability existed in the associative array implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2016-7914)  It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-7261)  It was discovered that the USB Cypress HID drivers for the Linux kernel did not properly validate reported information from the device. An attacker with physical access could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-7273)  A reference count bug was discovered in the Linux kernel ipx protocol stack. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-7487)  Huang Weller discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel mishandled a needs-flushing-before-commit list. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7495)  It was discovered that an information leak existed in the set_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-7616)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3406-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-129-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-3.13.0-129-generic - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-129-generic - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-3.13.0-129-lowlatency - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-3.13.0-129-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-3.13.0-129-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-3.13.0-129-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-3.13.0-129-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-129.178 linux-image-3.13.0-129-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-129.178 No subscription required",
