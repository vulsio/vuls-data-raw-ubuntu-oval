This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0119)  It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled data with malformed chunked transfer coding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks, or cause Tomcat to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0227)  It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled HTTP responses occurring before the entire request body was finished being read. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a limited denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0230)  It was discovered that the Tomcat Expression Language (EL) implementation incorrectly handled accessible interfaces implemented by inaccessible classes.
