		"description": "Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted Python paths when using the reverse() function. An attacker could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution. (CVE-2014-0472)  Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain pages that contained CSRF cookies. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a valid cookie and perform attacks which bypass the CSRF restrictions. (CVE-2014-0473)  Michael Koziarski discovered that Django did not always perform explicit conversion of certain fields when using a MySQL database. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain unexpected results. (CVE-2014-0474)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2169-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-django-doc - 1.6.1-2ubuntu0.1 python-django - 1.6.1-2ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
