		"description": "halfdog discovered that OverlayFS, when mounting on top of a FUSE mount, incorrectly propagated file attributes, including setuid. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1576)  halfdog discovered that OverlayFS in the Linux kernel incorrectly propagated security sensitive extended attributes, such as POSIX ACLs. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1575)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race between read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7550)  郭永刚 discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)  David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable task). (CVE-2015-8785)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2910-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.19.0-51-generic-lpae - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-51-lowlatency - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-51-generic - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-3.19.0-51-generic - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc-e500mc - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc64-smp - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc64-emb - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-51-powerpc-smp - 3.19.0-51.57~14.04.1 No subscription required",
