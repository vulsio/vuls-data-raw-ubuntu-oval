		"title": "USN-2797-1 -- Linux kernel (Utopic HWE) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0272)  It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information. (CVE-2015-2925)  Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-5257)  It was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel performed an incorrect sequence of protocol-initialization steps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-5283)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2797-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.16.0-52-powerpc-smp - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-52-powerpc64-smp - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-3.16.0-52-generic - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-52-powerpc64-emb - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-52-powerpc-e500mc - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-52-generic-lpae - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-52-lowlatency - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-52-generic - 3.16.0-52.71~14.04.1 No subscription required",
