An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a timing side-channel attack and recover private DSA keys. (CVE-2018-0734)  Samuel Weiser discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ECDSA signing. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a timing side-channel attack and recover private ECDSA keys. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-0735)  Billy Bob Brumley, Cesar Pereida Garcia, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri, and Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya discovered that Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) architectures are vulnerable to side-channel leakage. This issue is known as \"PortSmash\". An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a timing side-channel attack and recover private keys. (CVE-2018-5407)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3840-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27 No subscription required",
