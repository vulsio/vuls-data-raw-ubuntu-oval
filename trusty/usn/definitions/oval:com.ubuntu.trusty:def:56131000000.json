		"description": "It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks when executing spell suggestion commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0943)  It was discovered that Vim was using freed memory when dealing with regular expressions through its old regular expression engine. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve code execution. (CVE-2022-1154)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing checks on name of lambda functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue affected only Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1420)  It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing bounds checks when processing invalid commands with composing characters in Ex mode. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1616)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing latin1 data when issuing Ex commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1619)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing memory management when dealing with invalid regular expression patterns in buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1620)  It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing invalid bytes when performing spell check operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1621)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5613-1` to fix the vulnerability.
