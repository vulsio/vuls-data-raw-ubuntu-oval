		"description": "halfdog discovered that OverlayFS, when mounting on top of a FUSE mount, incorrectly propagated file attributes, including setuid. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1576)  halfdog discovered that OverlayFS in the Linux kernel incorrectly propagated security sensitive extended attributes, such as POSIX ACLs. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1575)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4312)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable task). (CVE-2015-8785)  Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive information. (CVE-2016-2069)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2908-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-4.2.0-30-generic - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-30-powerpc-smp - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-30-powerpc64-smp - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-30-lowlatency - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-30-powerpc-e500mc - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-30-generic - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-30-generic-lpae - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-30-powerpc64-emb - 4.2.0-30.35~14.04.1 No subscription required",
