		"description": "USN-4734-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in wpa_supplicant. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  It was discovered that wpa_supplicant did not properly handle P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) group information in some situations, leading to a heap overflow. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-0326)  It was discovered that hostapd did not properly handle UPnP subscribe messages in some circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12695)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4734-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  hostapd - 1:2.1-0ubuntu1.7+esm3 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  wpagui - 2.1-0ubuntu1.7+esm3 wpasupplicant-udeb - 2.1-0ubuntu1.7+esm3 wpasupplicant - 2.1-0ubuntu1.7+esm3 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
