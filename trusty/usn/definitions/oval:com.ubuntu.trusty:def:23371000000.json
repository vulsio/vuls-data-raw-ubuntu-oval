		"description": "A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel virtual machine's (kvm) validation of interrupt requests (irq). A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2014-0155)  Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the authorization of netlink socket operations when a socket is passed to a process of more privilege. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass access restrictions by having a privileged executable do something it was not intended to do. (CVE-2014-0181)  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernels aio_read_events_ring function. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-0206)  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of user namespaces with respect to inode permissions. A local user could exploit this flaw by creating a user namespace to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-4014)  An information leak was discovered in the rd_mcp backend of the iSCSI target subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from ramdisk_mcp memory by leveraging access to a SCSI initiator. (CVE-2014-4027)  Sasha Levin reported an issue with the Linux kernel's shared memory subsystem when used with range notifications and hole punching. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4171)  Toralf FÃ¶rster reported an error in the Linux kernels syscall auditing on 32 bit x86 platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS and system crash). (CVE-2014-4508)  An information leak was discovered in the control implemenation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-4652)  A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) control implementation of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-4653)  A authorization bug was discovered with the snd_ctl_elem_add function of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit his bug to cause a denial of service (remove kernel controls). (CVE-2014-4654)  A flaw discovered in how the snd_ctl_elem function of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) handled a reference count. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and limit bypass). (CVE-2014-4655)  An integer overflow flaw was discovered in the control implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-4656)  An integer underflow flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of the backlog value for certain SCTP packets. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet. (CVE-2014-4667)  Vasily Averin discover a reference count flaw during attempts to umount in conjunction with a symlink. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or use after free) or possibly have other unspecified impact. (CVE-2014-5045)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2337-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-3.13.0-35-generic - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-generic - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-lowlatency - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-35.62 linux-image-3.13.0-35-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-35.62 No subscription required",
