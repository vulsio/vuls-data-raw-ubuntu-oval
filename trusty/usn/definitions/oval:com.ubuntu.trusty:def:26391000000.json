		"description": "Praveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when buffering DTLS data. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8176)  Joseph Barr-Pixton discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed ECParameters structures. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1788)  Robert Swiecki and Hanno Böck discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ASN1_TIME strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1789)  Michal Zalewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled missing content when parsing ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1790)  Emilia Käsper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled NewSessionTicket when being used by a multi-threaded client. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1791)  Johannes Bauer discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled verifying signedData messages using the CMS code. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1792)  As a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to reject DH key sizes below 768 bits, preventing a possible downgrade attack.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2639-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15 No subscription required",
