		"title": "USN-4286-2 -- Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "USN-4286-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-14615)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Softmac USB Prism54 device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15220)  Julien Grall discovered that the Xen balloon memory driver in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the amount of memory set aside for page mappings in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-17351)  It was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19051)  It was discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19056)  It was discovered that the Brocade BFA Fibre Channel device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19066)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8xxx USB Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19068)  Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19965)  It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20096)  Mitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel when used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations before client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-5108)  It was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15217)  It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data size information from the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15221)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4286-2` to fix the vulnerability.
