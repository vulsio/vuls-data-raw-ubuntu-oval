		"description": "A null pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation when ASCONF is used. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a malformed INIT chunk. (CVE-2014-7841)  A race condition with MMIO and PIO transactions in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel was discovered. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a specially crafted application. (CVE-2014-7842)  Miloš Prchlík reported a flaw in how the ARM64 platform handles a single byte overflow in __clear_user. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by reading one byte beyond a /dev/zero page boundary. (CVE-2014-7843)  A stack buffer overflow was discovered in the ioctl command handling for the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC devices driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2014-8884)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2467-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc-smp - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-29-generic-lpae - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-3.16.0-29-generic - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc-e500mc - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-29-lowlatency - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc64-emb - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-29-powerpc64-smp - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-29-generic - 3.16.0-29.39~14.04.1 No subscription required",
