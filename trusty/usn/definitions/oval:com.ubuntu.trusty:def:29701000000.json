		"description": "Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7515)  Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single writes greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing to certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8830)  Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not take into account the mmap_min_addr value. A local attacker could use this to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2016-0821)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2184)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2185)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2186)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2188)  Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3136)  Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3137)  Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3138)  Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3140)  It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in the host OS. (CVE-2016-3156)  Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context- switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-3157)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3689)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2970-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.19.0-59-powerpc64-smp - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-59-lowlatency - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-3.19.0-59-generic - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-59-powerpc64-emb - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-59-powerpc-smp - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-59-powerpc-e500mc - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-59-generic-lpae - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-59-generic - 3.19.0-59.65~14.04.1 No subscription required",
