		"description": "USN-3275-2 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 7. Unfortunately, the update introduced a regression when handling TLS handshakes. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that OpenJDK improperly re-used cached NTLM  connections in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly  use this to cause a Java application to perform actions with the  credentials of a different user. (CVE-2017-3509)   It was discovered that an untrusted library search path flaw existed  in the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) component of OpenJDK. A  local attacker could possibly use this to gain the privileges of a  Java application. (CVE-2017-3511)   It was discovered that the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) component  in OpenJDK did not properly enforce size limits when parsing XML  documents. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  (processor and memory consumption). (CVE-2017-3526)   It was discovered that the FTP client implementation in OpenJDK did  not properly sanitize user inputs. If a user was tricked into opening  a specially crafted FTP URL, a remote attacker could use this to  manipulate the FTP connection. (CVE-2017-3533)   It was discovered that OpenJDK allowed MD5 to be used as an algorithm  for JAR integrity verification. An attacker could possibly use this  to modify the contents of a JAR file without detection. (CVE-2017-3539)   It was discovered that the SMTP client implementation in OpenJDK  did not properly sanitize sender and recipient addresses. A remote  attacker could use this to specially craft email addresses and gain  control of a Java application's SMTP connections. (CVE-2017-3544)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3275-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-7-jre-zero - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-source - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 icedtea-7-jre-jamvm - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-tests - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-jre-lib - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-jdk - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-jre-headless - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-jre - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-doc - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 openjdk-7-demo - 7u131-2.6.9-0ubuntu0.14.04.2 No subscription required",
