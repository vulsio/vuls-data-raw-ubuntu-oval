		"description": "It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker who could start and control a VM could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22543)  It was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)  Alois Wohlschlager discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux kernel did not restrict private clones in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3732)  Alexey Kardashevskiy discovered that the KVM implementation for PowerPC systems in the Linux kernel did not properly validate RTAS arguments in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-37576)  It was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-38204)  It was discovered that the Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the Linux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations. An attacker could use this information to ease the exploitation of another vulnerability. (CVE-2021-38205)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5094-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1124 - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1124 - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1124 - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1124.97 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
