		"description": "USN-3161-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  Tilman Schmidt and Sasha Levin discovered a use-after-free condition in the TTY implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2015-8964)  It was discovered that the Video For Linux Two (v4l2) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle multiple planes when processing a VIDIOC_DQBUF ioctl(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4568)  CAI Qian discovered that shared bind mounts in a mount namespace exponentially added entries without restriction to the Linux kernel's mount table. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-6213)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation for x86/x86_64 in the Linux kernel could dereference a null pointer. An attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the KVM host. (CVE-2016-8630)  Eyal Itkin discovered that the IP over IEEE 1394 (FireWire) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling fragmented packets. A remote attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-8633)  Marco Grassi discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel mishandles socket buffer (skb) truncation. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-8645)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled validation of incoming data. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-9555)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3161-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-57-generic - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-57-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-57-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-57-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-57-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-57-generic - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-57-lowlatency - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-57-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-57.78~14.04.1 No subscription required",
