		"description": "It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-27672)  Daniel Moghimi discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly clear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various instructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to sensitive information. (CVE-2022-40982)  Yang Lan discovered that the GFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious GFS2 image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3212)  It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication in certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)  It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle L2CAP socket release, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-40283)  It was discovered that some network classifier implementations in the Linux kernel contained use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4128)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6396-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1170 - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1170 - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1170 - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1170-azure - 4.15.0-1170.185~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1170.136 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
