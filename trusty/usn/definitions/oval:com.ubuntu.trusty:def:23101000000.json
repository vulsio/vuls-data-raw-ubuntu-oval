(CVE-2013-1418, CVE-2013-6800)  It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain invalid tokens. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be used to cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342)  It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain mechanisms when used with SPNEGO. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be used to cause clients to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4343)  It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain continuation tokens during SPNEGO negotiations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4344)  Tomas Kuthan and Greg Hudson discovered that the Kerberos kadmind daemon incorrectly handled buffers when used with the LDAP backend. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
