		"description": "Steven Hardy discovered that OpenStack Keystone did not properly handle chained delegation. A remove authenticated attacker could use this to gain privileges by creating a new token with additional roles. (CVE-2014-3476)  Jamie Lennox discovered that OpenStack Keystone did not properly validate the project id. A remote authenticated attacker may be able to use this to access other projects. (CVE-2014-3520)  Brant Knudson and Lance Bragstad discovered that OpenStack Keystone would not always revoke tokens correctly. If Keystone were configured to use revocation events, a remote authenticated attacker could continue to have access to resources. (CVE-2014-5251, CVE-2014-5252, CVE-2014-5253)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2324-1` to fix the vulnerability.
