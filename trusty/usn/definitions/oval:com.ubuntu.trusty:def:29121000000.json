		"description": "Mariusz Ziulek discovered that libssh incorrectly handled certain packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libssh to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-3146)  Aris Adamantiadis discovered that libssh incorrectly generated ephemeral secret keys of 128 bits instead of the recommended 1024 or 2048 bits when using the diffie-hellman-group1 and diffie-hellman-group14 methods. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. (CVE-2016-0739)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2912-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssh-4 - 0.6.1-0ubuntu3.3 libssh-dev - 0.6.1-0ubuntu3.3 libssh-doc - 0.6.1-0ubuntu3.3 No subscription required",
