		"description": "Daniel Genkin, Lev Pachmanov, Itamar Pipman, and Eran Tromer discovered that GnuPG was susceptible to an attack via physical side channels. A local attacker could use this attack to possibly recover private keys. (CVE-2014-3591)  Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, and Eran Tromer discovered that GnuPG was susceptible to an attack via physical side channels. A local attacker could use this attack to possibly recover private keys. (CVE-2015-0837)  Hanno BÃ¶ck discovered that GnuPG incorrectly handled certain malformed keyrings. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a malformed keyring, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause GnuPG to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-1606, CVE-2015-1607)  In addition, this update improves GnuPG security by validating that the keys returned by keyservers match those requested.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2554-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  gnupg-udeb - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.3 gpgv - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.3 gpgv-udeb - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.3 gnupg - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.3 gnupg-curl - 1.4.16-1ubuntu2.3 No subscription required  scdaemon - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.3 gpgsm - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.3 gnupg-agent - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.3 gnupg2 - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.3 gpgv2 - 2.0.22-3ubuntu1.3 No subscription required",
