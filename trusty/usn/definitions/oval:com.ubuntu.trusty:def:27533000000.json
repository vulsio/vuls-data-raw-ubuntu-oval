		"description": "USN-2753-1 fixed a vulnerability in LXC. The update caused a regression that prevented some containers from starting. This regression only affected containers that had a path that contained a '/./' directory specified as a bind mount target in their configuration file. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in lxc-start. A local  attacker with access to an LXC container could exploit this flaw to run  programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or expose  unintended files in the host to the container.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2753-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  lxc-dev - 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7 liblxc1 - 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7 lxc-templates - 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7 python3-lxc - 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7 lxc - 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7 lxc-tests - 1.0.7-0ubuntu0.7 No subscription required",
