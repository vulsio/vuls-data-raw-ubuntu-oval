		"description": "Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Andreas Kogler, David Oswald, Catherine Easdon, Claudio Canella, and Daniel Gruss discovered that the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) feature of some Intel processors allowed a side- channel attack based on power consumption measurements. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8695)  Ezra Caltum, Joseph Nuzman, Nir Shildan and Ofir Joseff discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly remove sensitive information before storage or transfer in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8696)  Ezra Caltum, Joseph Nuzman, Nir Shildan and Ofir Joseff discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly isolate shared resources in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8698)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4628-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  intel-microcode - 3.20201110.0ubuntu0.14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
