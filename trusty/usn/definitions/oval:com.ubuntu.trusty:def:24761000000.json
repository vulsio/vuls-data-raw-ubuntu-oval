		"description": "Several memory corruption bugs were discovered in ICU. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7923, CVE-2014-7926)  A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-7924)  A use-after free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7925)  Several memory corruption bugs were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7927, CVE-2014-7928, CVE-2014-7931)  Several use-after free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7929, CVE-2014-7930, CVE-2014-7932, CVE-2014-7934)  A use-after free was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7933)  Multiple off-by-one errors were discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7937)  A memory corruption bug was discovered in the fonts implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7938)  It was discovered that ICU did not initialize memory for a data structure correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7940)  It was discovered that the fonts implementation did not initialize memory for a data structure correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7942)  An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2014-7943)  An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2014-7946)  It was discovered that the AppCache proceeded with caching for SSL sessions even if there is a certificate error. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this by conducting a MITM attack to modify HTML application content. (CVE-2014-7948)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1205)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1346)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2476-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  liboxideqtcore0 - 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 liboxideqt-qmlplugin - 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-chromedriver - 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs-extra - 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqmlscene - 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs - 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 liboxideqtquick0 - 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 No subscription required",
