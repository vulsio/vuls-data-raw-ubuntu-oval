		"description": "It was discovered that the LWP::Protocol::https perl module incorrectly disabled peer certificate verification completely when only hostname verification was requested to be disabled. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could possibly be exploited in certain scenarios to alter or compromise confidential information in applications that used the LWP::Protocol::https module.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2292-1` to fix the vulnerability.
