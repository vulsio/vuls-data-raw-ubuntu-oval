		"description": "It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle setxattr operations in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19319)  It was discovered that memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY read operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly exposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0543)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that race conditions existed in the file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12114)  It was discovered that the USB susbsystem's scatter-gather implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly take data references in some situations, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12464)  It was discovered that the DesignWare SPI controller driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12769)  It was discovered that the exit signaling implementation in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (arbitrary application crash). (CVE-2020-12826)  Xiumei Mu discovered that the IPSec implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly encrypt IPv6 traffic in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-1749)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the SELinux netlink security hook in the Linux kernel did not validate messages in some situations. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions. (CVE-2020-10751)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4391-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1073-aws - 4.4.0-1073.77 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-4.4.0-184-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-184.214~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-184-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-184.214~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-184-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-184.214~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-184-lowlatency - 4.4.0-184.214~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-184-generic - 4.4.0-184.214~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-184-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-184.214~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-184-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-184.214~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1073.70 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-powerpc-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 linux-image-powerpc64-emb-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 linux-image-powerpc64-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 linux-image-powerpc-e500mc-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.184.161 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
