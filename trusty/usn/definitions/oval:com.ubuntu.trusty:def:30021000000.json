		"description": "Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-2117)  Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap() handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-1583)  Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-4004)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2187)  Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86 processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. (CVE-2016-3672)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3951)  It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-3955)  Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). (CVE-2016-3961)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4485)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4486)  Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded. (CVE-2016-4565)  It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-4581)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3002-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc-e500mc - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc64-emb - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-4.2.0-38-generic - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc-smp - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc64-smp - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-38-lowlatency - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-38-generic-lpae - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 linux-image-4.2.0-38-generic - 4.2.0-38.45~14.04.1 No subscription required",
