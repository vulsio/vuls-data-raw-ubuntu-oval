		"description": "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure, data integrity and availability. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive data over the network. (CVE-2014-0429, CVE-2014-0446, CVE-2014-0451, CVE-2014-0452, CVE-2014-0454, CVE-2014-0455, CVE-2014-0456, CVE-2014-0457, CVE-2014-0458, CVE-2014-0461, CVE-2014-2397, CVE-2014-2402, CVE-2014-2412, CVE-2014-2414, CVE-2014-2421, CVE-2014-2423, CVE-2014-2427)  Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure and data integrity. An attacker could exploit these to expose sensitive data over the network. (CVE-2014-0453, CVE-2014-0460)  A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to availability. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0459)  Jakub Wilk discovered that the OpenJDK JRE incorrectly handled temporary files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files. In the default installation of Ubuntu, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions. (CVE-2014-1876)  Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to data integrity. (CVE-2014-2398, CVE-2014-2413)  A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure. An attacker could exploit this to expose sensitive data over the network.
