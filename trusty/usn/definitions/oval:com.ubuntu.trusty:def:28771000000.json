		"description": "A bad cast was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-1612)  An issue was discovered when initializing the UnacceleratedImageBufferSurface class in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-1614)  An issue was discovered with the CSP implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether specific HSTS sites had been visited by reading a CSP report. (CVE-2016-1617)  An issue was discovered with random number generator in Blink. An attacker could potentially exploit this to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms. (CVE-2016-1618)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1620)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-2051)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Harfbuzz. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-2052)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2877-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  liboxideqtcore0 - 1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 liboxideqt-qmlplugin - 1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-chromedriver - 1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs-extra - 1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqmlscene - 1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs - 1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 liboxideqtquick0 - 1.12.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 No subscription required",
