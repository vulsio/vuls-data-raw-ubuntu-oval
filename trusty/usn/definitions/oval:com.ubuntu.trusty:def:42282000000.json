		"description": "USN-4228-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)  It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell Libertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)  Anthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture systems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)  It was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)  It was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input devices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)  It was discovered that the PEAK-System Technik USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly sanitize memory before sending it to the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19534)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4228-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1060-aws - 4.4.0-1060.64 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-4.4.0-171-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-171.200~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-171-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-171.200~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-171-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-171.200~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-171-generic - 4.4.0-171.200~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-171-lowlatency - 4.4.0-171.200~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-171-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-171.200~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-171-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-171.200~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1060.61 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-powerpc-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 linux-image-powerpc64-emb-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 linux-image-powerpc64-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 linux-image-powerpc-e500mc-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.171.150 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
