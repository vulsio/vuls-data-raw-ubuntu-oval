		"description": "USN-3208-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  It was discovered that the generic SCSI block layer in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict write operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-10088)  CAI Qian discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations. An unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2016-9191)  Jim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel mismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash). (CVE-2016-9588)  Andy Lutomirski and Willy Tarreau discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly emulate instructions on the SS segment register. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges in the guest OS. (CVE-2017-2583)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel improperly emulated certain instructions. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-2584)  It was discovered that the KLSI KL5KUSB105 serial-to-USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory related to logging. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-5549)  Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-6074)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3208-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-64-generic - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-64-lowlatency - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-64-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-64-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-64-generic - 4.4.0-64.85~14.04.1 No subscription required",
