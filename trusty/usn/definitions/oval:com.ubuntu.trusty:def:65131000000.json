		"description": "It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain plist files. If a user or an automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted plist file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-48564)  It was discovered that Python instances of ssl.SSLSocket were vulnerable to a bypass of the TLS handshake. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause applications to treat unauthenticated received data before TLS handshake as authenticated data after TLS handshake. (CVE-2023-40217)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6513-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libpython2.7-minimal - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 libpython2.7 - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 python2.7 - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 python2.7-dev - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 libpython2.7-testsuite - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 libpython2.7-dev - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 python2.7-minimal - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 idle-python2.7 - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 python2.7-doc - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 python2.7-examples - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 libpython2.7-stdlib - 2.7.6-8ubuntu0.6+esm18 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
