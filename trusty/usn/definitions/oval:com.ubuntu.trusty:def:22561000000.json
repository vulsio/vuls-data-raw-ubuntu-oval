		"description": "John Dickinson discovered that Swift did not properly quote the WWW-Authenticate header value. If a user were tricked into navigating to a malicious Swift URL, an attacker could conduct cross-site scripting attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2256-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  swift-account - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 python-swift - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 swift-doc - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 swift-proxy - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 swift-container - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 swift - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 swift-object-expirer - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 swift-object - 1.13.1-0ubuntu1.1 No subscription required",
