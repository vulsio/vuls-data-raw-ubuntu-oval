		"description": "It was discovered that a memory leak existed in certain GNU binutils modules. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-19724, CVE-2020-21490)  It was discovered that GNU binutils was not properly performing bounds checks in several functions, which could lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, expose sensitive information or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-19726, CVE-2021-46174, CVE-2022-45703)  It was discovered that GNU binutils was not properly initializing heap memory when processing certain print instructions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-35342)  It was discovered that GNU binutils was not properly handling the logic behind certain memory management related operations, which could lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-44840)  It was discovered that GNU binutils was not properly handling the logic behind certain memory management related operations, which could lead to an invalid memory access. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-47695)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6381-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  binutils-dev - 2.24-5ubuntu14.2+esm3 binutils-multiarch-dev - 2.24-5ubuntu14.2+esm3 binutils-static - 2.24-5ubuntu14.2+esm3 binutils-doc - 2.24-5ubuntu14.2+esm3 binutils-multiarch - 2.24-5ubuntu14.2+esm3 binutils - 2.24-5ubuntu14.2+esm3 binutils-source - 2.24-5ubuntu14.2+esm3 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
