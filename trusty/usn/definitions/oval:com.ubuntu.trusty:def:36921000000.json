		"description": "Keegan Ryan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ECDSA key generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing attack and recover private ECDSA keys. (CVE-2018-0495)  Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled very large prime values during a key agreement. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2018-0732)  Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, Billy Brumley, Cesar Pereida Garcia and Luis Manuel Alvarez Tapia discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled RSA key generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing attack and recover private RSA keys. (CVE-2018-0737)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3692-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.26 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.26 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.26 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.26 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.26 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.26 No subscription required",
