		"description": "Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that the crash file parser in Apport improperly treated the CrashDB field as python code. An attacker could use this to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-9949)  Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that Apport did not properly sanitize the Package and SourcePackage fields in crash files before processing package specific hooks. An attacker could use this to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2016-9950)  Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that Apport would offer to restart an application based on the contents of the RespawnCommand or ProcCmdline fields in a crash file. An attacker could use this to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2016-9951)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3157-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  apport - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 python3-problem-report - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 apport-kde - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 apport-retrace - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 apport-valgrind - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 python3-apport - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 dh-apport - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 apport-gtk - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 python-apport - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 python-problem-report - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 apport-noui - 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.23 No subscription required",
