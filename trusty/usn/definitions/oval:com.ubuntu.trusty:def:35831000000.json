		"description": "It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the Flash-Friendly File System (f2fs) in the Linux kernel. An attacker could construct a malicious file system that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0750)  It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2017-1000407)  Bo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain requests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)  Vitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the SCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly track reference counts when merging buffers. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2017-12190)  It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12192)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the sysfs interface for the QLogic 24xx+ series SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14051)  Otto Ebeling discovered that the memory manager in the Linux kernel did not properly check the effective UID in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-14140)  It was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-14156)  ChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)  James Patrick-Evans discovered a race condition in the LEGO USB Infrared Tower driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15102)  ChunYu Wang discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, (CVE-2017-15115)  It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle NULL payloads with non-zero length values. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-15274)  It was discovered that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) implementation in the Linux kernel did not validate the type of socket passed in the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(). A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15868)  Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the USB serial console driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-16525)  It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt_osf) module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list. (CVE-2017-17450)  It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17806)  Denys Fedoryshchenko discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the netfilter xt_TCPMSS filter of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18017)  Gareth Evans discovered that the shm IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict mapping page zero. A local privileged attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5669)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existing in the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2017-7542)  Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler discovered that the memory manager in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism. A local attacker with access to /dev/mem could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7889)  Mohamed Ghannam discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-8824)  Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-5333)  范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5344)  USN-3524-1 mitigated CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown) for the amd64 architecture in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding mitigations for the ppc64el architecture. Original advisory details:   Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution  and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via  sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could  use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.  (CVE-2017-5754)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3583-1` to fix the vulnerability.
