		"description": "Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. (CVE-2018-3639)  Jan H. Sch√∂nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges in the host. (CVE-2017-12134)  It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-13220)  It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-13305)  It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel netlink traffic). (CVE-2017-17449)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-18079)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18203)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2017-18204)  It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2) implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2017-18208)  Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-18221)  Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8822)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3655-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-149-lowlatency - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-149-generic - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-3.13.0-149-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-3.13.0-149-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-3.13.0-149-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-3.13.0-149-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-3.13.0-149-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-149.199 linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-149.199 No subscription required",
