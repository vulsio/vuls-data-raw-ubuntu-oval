		"description": "Ke Sun, Alyssa Milburn, Henrique Kawakami, Emma Benoit, Igor Chervatyuk, Lisa Aichele, and Thais Moreira Hamasaki discovered that the Spectre Variant 2 mitigations for AMD processors on Linux were insufficient in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-26401)  Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser discovered that several Xen para- virtualization device frontends did not properly restrict the access rights of device backends. An attacker could possibly use a malicious Xen backend to gain access to memory pages of a guest VM or cause a denial of service in the guest. (CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040, CVE-2022-23042)  It was discovered that the USB Gadget file system interface in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24958)  It was discovered that the USB gadget subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate interface descriptor requests. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-25258)  It was discovered that the Remote NDIS (RNDIS) USB gadget implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-25375)  It was discovered that the ST21NFCA NFC driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of certain data in EVT_TRANSACTION events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-26490)  It was discovered that the USB SR9700 ethernet device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate the length of requests from the device. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26966)  It was discovered that the Xilinx USB2 device gadget driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint indices from the host. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-27223)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5418-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1138 - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1138 - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1138 - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1138.110 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
