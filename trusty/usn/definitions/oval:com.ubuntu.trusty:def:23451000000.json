		"description": "Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3178, CVE-2014-3190, CVE-2014-3191, CVE-2014-3192)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3179, CVE-2014-3200)  It was discovered that Chromium did not properly handle the interaction of IPC and V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3188)  A use-after-free was discovered in the web workers implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via applicatin crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3194)  It was discovered that V8 did not correctly handle Javascript heap allocations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3195)  It was discovered that Blink did not properly provide substitute data for pages blocked by the XSS auditor. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3197)  It was discovered that the wrap function for Event's in the V8 bindings in Blink produced an erroneous result in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service by stopping a worker process that was handling an Event object. (CVE-2014-3199)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7967)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2345-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  liboxideqtcore0 - 1.2.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs - 1.2.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 liboxideqt-qmlplugin - 1.2.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqmlscene - 1.2.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs-extra - 1.2.5-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 No subscription required",
