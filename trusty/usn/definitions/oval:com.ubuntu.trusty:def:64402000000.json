		"description": "Seth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform address randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2023-0597)  It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a high rate of hash collisions in connection lookup table. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive CPU consumption). (CVE-2023-1206)  Yu Hao and Weiteng Chen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI UART driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-31083)  Ross Lagerwall discovered that the Xen netback backend driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain unusual packets from a paravirtualized network frontend, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-34319)  Lin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3772)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the networking stack implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate skb object size in certain conditions. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42752)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate array offsets, leading to a out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42753)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). Please note that kernel packet classifier support for RSVP has been removed to resolve this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-42755)  Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered that the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4622)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inner classes, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4623)  Alex Birnberg discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate register length, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4881)  It was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle network packets in certain conditions, leading to a use after free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4921)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6440-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1171 - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1171 - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1171 - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1171-azure - 4.15.0-1171.186~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1171.137 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
