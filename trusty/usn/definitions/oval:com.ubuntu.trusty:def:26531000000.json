		"description": "It was discovered that multiple Python protocol libraries incorrectly limited certain data when connecting to servers. A malicious ftp, http, imap, nntp, pop or smtp server could use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-1752)  It was discovered that the Python xmlrpc library did not limit unpacking gzip-compressed HTTP bodies. A malicious server could use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-1753)  It was discovered that the Python json module incorrectly handled a certain argument. An attacker could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary memory and expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-4616)  It was discovered that the Python CGIHTTPServer incorrectly handled URL-encoded path separators in URLs. A remote attacker could use this issue to expose sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-4650)  It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled sizes and offsets in buffer functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary memory and obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-7185)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2653-1` to fix the vulnerability.
