		"description": "USN-3146-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  It was discovered that the __get_user_asm_ex implementation in the Linux kernel for x86/x86_64 contained extended asm statements that were incompatible with the exception table. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-9644)  Andreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a setxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group privileges. (CVE-2016-7097)  Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2016-7425)  Daxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2016-8658)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3146-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-51-lowlatency - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-51-generic - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-51-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-51-generic - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-51-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-51.72~14.04.1 No subscription required",
