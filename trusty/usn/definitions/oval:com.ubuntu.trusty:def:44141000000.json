		"description": "It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for error conditions in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16089)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate file system metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19036, CVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816)  It was discovered that the btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly detect that a block was marked dirty in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when unmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19377)  It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check return values in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19462)  Matthew Sheets discovered that the SELinux network label handling implementation in the Linux kernel could be coerced into de-referencing a NULL pointer. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-10711)  It was discovered that the SCSI generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions correctly. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12770)  It was discovered that the USB Gadget device driver in the Linux kernel did not validate arguments passed from configfs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-13143)  It was discovered that the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel did not handle memory allocation failures during early boot in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-12380)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel in some error conditions could report register information to the dmesg buffer. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-19039)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4414-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-1091-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1091.68 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
