		"description": "USN-4376-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  Original advisory details:   Cesar Pereida Garc√≠a, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri, Iaroslav Gridin,  Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Brumley discovered that OpenSSL  incorrectly handled ECDSA signatures. An attacker could possibly use this  issue to perform a timing side-channel attack and recover private ECDSA  keys. (CVE-2019-1547)   Juraj Somorovsky, Robert Merget, and Nimrod Aviram discovered that certain  applications incorrectly used OpenSSL and could be exposed to a padding  oracle attack. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to decrypt  data. (CVE-2019-1559)   Bernd Edlinger discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain  decryption functions. In certain scenarios, a remote attacker could  possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle attack and decrypt  traffic. (CVE-2019-1563)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4376-2` to fix the vulnerability.
