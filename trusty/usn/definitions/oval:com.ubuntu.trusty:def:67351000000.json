		"description": "It was discovered that Node.js incorrectly handled the use of invalid public keys while creating an x509 certificate. If a user or an automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted input file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10. (CVE-2023-30588)  It was discovered that Node.js incorrectly handled the use of CRLF sequences to delimit HTTP requests. If a user or an automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted input file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain unauthorised access. This issue only affected  Ubuntu 23.10. (CVE-2023-30589)  It was discovered that Node.js incorrectly described the generateKeys() function in the documentation. This inconsistency could possibly lead to security issues in applications that use these APIs. (CVE-2023-30590)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6735-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  nodejs - 0.10.25~dfsg2-2ubuntu1.2+esm2 nodejs-dev - 0.10.25~dfsg2-2ubuntu1.2+esm2 nodejs-legacy - 0.10.25~dfsg2-2ubuntu1.2+esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
