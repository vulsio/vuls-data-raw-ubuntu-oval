		"description": "Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation could reassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)  It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform access control. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129)  It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28972)  It was discovered that a use-after-free existed in the Bluetooth HCI driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33034)  Norbert Slusarek discovered that the CAN broadcast manger (bcm) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-34693)  马哲宇 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)  It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle HCI device initialization failure, leading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3564)  Murray McAllister discovered that the joystick device interface in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data passed via an ioctl(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on systems with a joystick device registered. (CVE-2021-3612)  It was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)  It was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-38204)  It was discovered that the 6pack network protocol driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform validation checks. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42008)  Amit Klein discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel could disclose internal state in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-45485)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5299-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-aws-tools-4.4.0-1099 - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-image-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-headers-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-aws-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1099 - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-aws-headers-4.4.0-1099 - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-modules-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104 linux-tools-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-tools-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-cloud-tools-4.4.0-219 - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-219 - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-tools-4.4.0-219 - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-tools-aws - 4.4.0.1099.97 linux-aws - 4.4.0.1099.97 linux-headers-aws - 4.4.0.1099.97 linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1099.97 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-cloud-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-cloud-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-signed-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-image-extra-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-headers-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-signed-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-signed-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-headers-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-signed-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-headers-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-cloud-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.219.190 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
