(CVE-2013-7041)  Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam_timestamp module incorrectly performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-2583)  Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam_unix module incorrectly handled large passwords.
