		"description": "USN-2169-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Django. The upstream security patch for CVE-2014-0472 introduced a regression for certain applications. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted Python  paths when using the reverse() function. An attacker could use this issue  to cause Django to import arbitrary modules from the Python path, resulting  in possible code execution. (CVE-2014-0472)    Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain pages that  contained CSRF cookies. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain  a valid cookie and perform attacks which bypass the CSRF restrictions.  (CVE-2014-0473)    Michael Koziarski discovered that Django did not always perform explicit  conversion of certain fields when using a MySQL database. An attacker  could possibly use this issue to obtain unexpected results. (CVE-2014-0474)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2169-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-django-doc - 1.6.1-2ubuntu0.2 python-django - 1.6.1-2ubuntu0.2 No subscription required",
