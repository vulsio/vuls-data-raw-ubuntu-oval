		"description": "It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15594)  It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15572)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Linux kernel when loading an executable to run. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2018-14634)  It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14633)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-6554)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-6555)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3775-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-160-generic - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-3.13.0-160-generic - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-3.13.0-160-lowlatency - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-3.13.0-160-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-160.210 linux-image-3.13.0-160-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-160.210 No subscription required",
