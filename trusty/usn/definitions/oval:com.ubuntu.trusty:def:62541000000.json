		"description": "Jordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that syscalls invoking the do_prlimit() function in the Linux kernel did not properly handle speculative execution barriers. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0458)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1611)  It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain images. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2124)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI TCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)  It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle extra inode size for extended attributes, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-2513)  It was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3090)  It was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3141)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3159)  Sanan Hasanov discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform checks for font dimension limits. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3161)  It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform certain buffer calculations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3268)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3390)  Tanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35001)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6254-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-aws-headers-4.4.0-1121 - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-headers-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-aws-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1121 - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-modules-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-image-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-aws-tools-4.4.0-1121 - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127 linux-tools-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-243 - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-tools-4.4.0-243 - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-cloud-tools-4.4.0-243 - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-tools-aws - 4.4.0.1121.118 linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1121.118 linux-aws - 4.4.0.1121.118 linux-headers-aws - 4.4.0.1121.118 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-cloud-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-signed-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-image-extra-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-headers-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-signed-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-signed-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-headers-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-cloud-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-signed-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-headers-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-cloud-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.243.211 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
