		"description": "An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. (CVE-2015-1593)  An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel's handling of userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. (CVE-2015-2041)  An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. (CVE-2015-2042)  A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's scsi subsystem. A local attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4036)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2564-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.16.0-34-generic-lpae - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-3.16.0-34-generic - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-34-lowlatency - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-34-generic - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc64-emb - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc-smp - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc64-smp - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc-e500mc - 3.16.0-34.45~14.04.1 No subscription required",
