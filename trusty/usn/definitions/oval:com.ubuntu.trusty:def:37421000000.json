		"description": "It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)  It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the kernel or other processes). (CVE-2018-3620)  Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX timers subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-18344)  Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5390)  Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5391)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3742-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-155-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-3.13.0-155-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-3.13.0-155-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-3.13.0-155-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-3.13.0-155-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-3.13.0-155-lowlatency - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-3.13.0-155-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-3.13.0-155-generic - 3.13.0-155.205 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-155-generic - 3.13.0-155.205 No subscription required",
