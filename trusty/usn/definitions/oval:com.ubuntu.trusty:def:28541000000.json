		"description": "Felix Wilhelm discovered a race condition in the Xen paravirtualized drivers which can cause double fetch vulnerabilities. An attacker in the paravirtualized guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the host) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host. (CVE-2015-8550)  Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk discovered the Xen PCI backend driver does not perform consistency checks on the device's state. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference) on the host. (CVE-2015-8551)  Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk discovered the Xen PCI backend driver does not perform consistency checks on the device's state. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service by flooding the logging system with WARN() messages causing the initial domain to exhaust disk space. (CVE-2015-8552)  Jann Horn discovered a ptrace issue with user namespaces in the Linux kernel. The namespace owner could potentially exploit this flaw by ptracing a root owned process entering the user namespace to elevate its privileges and potentially gain access outside of the namespace. (http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1527374, CVE-2015-8709)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2854-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-3.19.0-42-generic - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-42-generic-lpae - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-42-powerpc64-emb - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-42-powerpc64-smp - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-42-generic - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-42-lowlatency - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-42-powerpc-smp - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-42-powerpc-e500mc - 3.19.0-42.48~14.04.1 No subscription required",
