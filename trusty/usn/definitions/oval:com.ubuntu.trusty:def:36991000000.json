		"description": "It was discovered that zziplib incorrectly handled certain malformed ZIP files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted ZIP file, a remote attacker could cause zziplib to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3699-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  zziplib-bin - 0.13.62-2ubuntu0.2 libzzip-0-13 - 0.13.62-2ubuntu0.2 libzzip-dev - 0.13.62-2ubuntu0.2 No subscription required",
