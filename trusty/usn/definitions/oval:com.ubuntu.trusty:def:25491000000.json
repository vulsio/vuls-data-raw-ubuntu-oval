		"description": "It was discovered that the libarchive bsdcpio utility extracted absolute paths by default without using the --insecure flag, contrary to expectations. If a user or automated system were tricked into extracting cpio archives containing absolute paths, a remote attacker may be able to write to arbitrary files. (CVE-2015-2304)  Fabian Yamaguchi discovered that libarchive incorrectly handled certain type conversions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libarchive to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-0211)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2549-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  bsdcpio - 3.1.2-7ubuntu2.1 libarchive13 - 3.1.2-7ubuntu2.1 bsdtar - 3.1.2-7ubuntu2.1 libarchive-dev - 3.1.2-7ubuntu2.1 No subscription required",
