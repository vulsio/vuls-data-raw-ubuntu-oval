If a user or automated system were tricked into extracting a specially-crafted cpio archive, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to write arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-1197)  Gustavo Grieco discovered that GNU cpio incorrectly handled memory when extracting archive files. If a user or automated system were tricked into extracting a specially-crafted cpio archive, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause GNU cpio to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2037)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2906-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  cpio - 2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2 No subscription required",
