		"description": "It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain malformed gzip archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted gzip archive, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause BusyBox to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-28831)  It was discovered that BusyBox did not properly validate user input when performing certain arithmetic operations. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause BusyBox to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-48174)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6335-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  busybox - 1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1.4+esm1 busybox-syslogd - 1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1.4+esm1 udhcpd - 1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1.4+esm1 busybox-initramfs - 1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1.4+esm1 udhcpc - 1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1.4+esm1 busybox-static - 1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1.4+esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
