		"description": "It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled large amounts of data. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Python to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-1000030)  It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled running external commands in the shutil module. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Python to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-1000802)  It was discovered that Python incorrectly used regular expressions vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-1060, CVE-2018-1061)  It was discovered that Python failed to initialize Expat's hash salt. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause hash collisions, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2018-14647)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3817-1` to fix the vulnerability.
