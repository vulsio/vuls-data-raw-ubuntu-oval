		"description": "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure, data integrity, and availability. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive data over the network. (CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-2628, CVE-2015-4731, CVE-2015-4732, CVE-2015-4733, CVE-2015-4760, CVE-2015-4748)  Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the cryptographic components of the OpenJDK JRE. An attacker could exploit these to expose sensitive data over the network. (CVE-2015-2601, CVE-2015-2808, CVE-2015-4000, CVE-2015-2625, CVE-2015-2613)  As a security improvement, this update modifies OpenJDK behavior to disable RC4 TLS/SSL cipher suites by default.  As a security improvement, this update modifies OpenJDK behavior to reject DH key sizes below 768 bits by default, preventing a possible downgrade attack.  Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure. An attacker could exploit these to expose sensitive data over the network. (CVE-2015-2621, CVE-2015-2632)  A vulnerability was discovered with how the JNDI component of the OpenJDK JRE handles DNS resolutions. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-4749)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2696-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-7-jre-zero - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 openjdk-7-source - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 icedtea-7-jre-jamvm - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jre-lib - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jdk - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jre-headless - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jre - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 openjdk-7-demo - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 openjdk-7-doc - 7u79-2.5.6-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 No subscription required",
