		"description": "An issue was discovered in Blink involving the provisional URL for an initially empty document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL. (CVE-2016-5141)  A use-after-free was discovered in the WebCrypto implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5142)  It was discovered that the devtools subsystem in Blink mishandles various parameters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2016-5143, CVE-2016-5144)  It was discovered that Blink does not ensure that a taint property is preserved after a structure-clone operation on an ImageBitmap object derived from a cross-origin image. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-5145)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5146, CVE-2016-5167)  It was discovered that Blink mishandles deferred page loads. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2016-5147)  An issue was discovered in Blink related to widget updates. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2016-5148)  A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5150)  A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5153)  It was discovered that Chromium does not correctly validate access to the initial document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL. (CVE-2016-5155)  A use-after-free was discovered in the event bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5156)  A type confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5161)  An issue was discovered with the devtools implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2016-5164)  An issue was discovered with the devtools implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2016-5165)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3058-1` to fix the vulnerability.
