		"description": "Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled ICC color profiles in JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8137)  Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly decoded certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8138)  It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8157)  It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled memory when processing JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8158)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2483-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libjasper-runtime - 1.900.1-14ubuntu3.2 libjasper-dev - 1.900.1-14ubuntu3.2 libjasper1 - 1.900.1-14ubuntu3.2 No subscription required",
