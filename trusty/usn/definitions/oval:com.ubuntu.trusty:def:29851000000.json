		"description": "Martin Carpenter discovered that pt_chown in the GNU C Library did not properly check permissions for tty files. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2013-2207, CVE-2016-2856)  Robin Hack discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly manage its file descriptors. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2014-8121)  Joseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle long arguments to functions returning a representation of Not a Number (NaN). An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-9761)  Arjun Shankar discovered that in certain situations the nss_dns code in the GNU C Library did not properly account buffer sizes when passed an unaligned buffer. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-1781)  Sumit Bose and Lukas Slebodnik discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not handle long lines in the files databases correctly. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-5277)  Adam Nielsen discovered that the strftime function in the GNU C Library did not properly handle out-of-range argument data. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8776)  Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the GNU C Library allowed the pointer-guarding protection mechanism to be disabled by honoring the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable across privilege boundaries. A local attacker could use this to exploit an existing vulnerability more easily. (CVE-2015-8777)  Szabolcs Nagy discovered that the hcreate functions in the GNU C Library did not properly check its size argument, leading to an integer overflow. An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8778)  Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the catopen function in the GNU C Library when handling long catalog names. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8779)  Florian Weimer discovered that the getnetbyname implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly handle long names passed as arguments. An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an application crash). (CVE-2016-3075)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2985-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libc6-i386 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-ppc64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libnss-dns-udeb - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc-bin - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-x32 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-prof - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-armel - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 eglibc-source - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-pic - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-dev-ppc64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-dev-armel - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libnss-files-udeb - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 glibc-doc - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 multiarch-support - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-dev - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-amd64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-dev-amd64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-dev-x32 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-udeb - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc6-dev-i386 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 libc-dev-bin - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 nscd - 2.19-0ubuntu6.8 No subscription required",
