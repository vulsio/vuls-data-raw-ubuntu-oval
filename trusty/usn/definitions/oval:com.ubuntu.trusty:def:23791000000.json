		"description": "Steven Vittitoe reported multiple stack buffer overflows in Linux kernel's magicmouse HID driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via specially crafted devices. (CVE-2014-3181)  Ben Hawkes reported some off by one errors for report descriptors in the Linux kernel's HID stack. A physically proximate attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2014-3184)  Several bounds check flaws allowing for buffer overflows were discovered in the Linux kernel's Whiteheat USB serial driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2014-3185)  Steven Vittitoe reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's PicoLCD HID device driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a specially craft device. (CVE-2014-3186)  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's associative-array garbage collection implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact by using keyctl operations. (CVE-2014-3631)  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem (used on some CD-ROMs and DVDs) when processing indirect ICBs. An attacker who can cause CD, DVD or image file with a specially crafted inode to be mounted can cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption). (CVE-2014-6410)  James Eckersall discovered a buffer overflow in the Ceph filesystem in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and panic) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket. (CVE-2014-6416)  James Eckersall discovered a flaw in the handling of memory allocation failures in the Ceph filesystem. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact. (CVE-2014-6417)  James Eckersall discovered a flaw in how the Ceph filesystem validates auth replies. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact. (CVE-2014-6418)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2379-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-3.13.0-37-lowlatency - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-3.13.0-37-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-3.13.0-37-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-3.13.0-37-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-3.13.0-37-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-37-generic - 3.13.0-37.64 linux-image-3.13.0-37-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-37.64 No subscription required",
