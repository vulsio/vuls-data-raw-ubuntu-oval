		"description": "Jim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel mismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash). (CVE-2016-9588)  It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges. (CVE-2017-13168)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16649)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-16658)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-9363)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3822-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-162-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-3.13.0-162-generic - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-3.13.0-162-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-3.13.0-162-lowlatency - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-3.13.0-162-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-3.13.0-162-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-3.13.0-162-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-162-generic - 3.13.0-162.212 linux-image-3.13.0-162-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-162.212 No subscription required",
