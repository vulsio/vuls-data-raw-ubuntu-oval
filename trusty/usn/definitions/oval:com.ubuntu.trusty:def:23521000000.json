(CVE-2014-3636)  Alban Crequy discovered that DBus incorrectly handled certain file descriptor messages. A local attacker could use this issue to cause DBus to maintain persistent connections, possibly resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-3637)  Alban Crequy discovered that DBus incorrectly handled a large number of parallel connections and parallel message calls. A local attacker could use this issue to cause DBus to consume resources, possibly resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3638)  Alban Crequy discovered that DBus incorrectly handled incomplete connections. A local attacker could use this issue to cause DBus to fail legitimate connection attempts, resulting in a denial of service.
