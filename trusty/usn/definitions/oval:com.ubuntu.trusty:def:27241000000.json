		"description": "It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled a PRDT with zero complete sectors in the IDE functionality. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-9718)  Donghai Zhu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the RTL8139 driver. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue to read sensitive information from arbitrary host memory. (CVE-2015-5165)  Donghai Zhu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled unplugging emulated block devices. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the user running the QEMU process. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 15.04. (CVE-2015-5166)  Qinghao Tang and Mr. Zuozhi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory in the VNC display driver. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the user running the QEMU process. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 15.04. (CVE-2015-5225)  It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the user running the QEMU process. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.04. (CVE-2015-5745)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2724-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  qemu-system-common - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-user-static - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system-misc - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-kvm - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-user - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-keymaps - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-guest-agent - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-utils - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system-aarch64 - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system-x86 - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-common - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system-sparc - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system-arm - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system-ppc - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 qemu-system-mips - 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.17 No subscription required",
