		"description": "Jason Hullinger discovered that OpenStack Horizon did not properly perform input sanitization on Heat templates. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted Heat template, an attacker could conduct cross-site scripting attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2014-3473)  Craig Lorentzen discovered that OpenStack Horizon did not properly perform input sanitization when creating networks. If a user were tricked into launching an image using the crafted network name, an attacker could conduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2014-3474)  Michael Xin discovered that OpenStack Horizon did not properly perform input sanitization when adding users. If an admin user were tricked into viewing the users page containing a crafted email address, an attacker could conduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2014-3475)  Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich discovered that OpenStack Horizon did not properly perform input sanitization when creating host aggregates. If an admin user were tricked into viewing the Host Aggregates page containing a crafted availability zone name, an attacker could conduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2014-3594)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2323-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openstack-dashboard - 1:2014.1.2-0ubuntu1.1 python-django-horizon - 1:2014.1.2-0ubuntu1.1 python-django-openstack - 1:2014.1.2-0ubuntu1.1 openstack-dashboard-ubuntu-theme - 1:2014.1.2-0ubuntu1.1 No subscription required",
