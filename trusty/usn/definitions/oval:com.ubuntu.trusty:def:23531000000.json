		"title": "USN-2353-1 -- APT vulnerability",
		"description": "It was discovered that APT incorrectly handled certain http URLs. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to cause APT to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-6273)  In addition, this update fixes regressions introduced by the USN-2348-1 security update: APT incorrectly handled file:/// sources on a different partition, incorrectly handled Dir::state::lists set to a relative path, and incorrectly handled cdrom: sources.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2353-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libapt-inst1.5 - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 apt-doc - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 apt-transport-https - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 libapt-pkg-doc - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 apt - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 apt-utils - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 libapt-pkg-dev - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 libapt-pkg4.12 - 1.0.1ubuntu2.4.1 No subscription required",
