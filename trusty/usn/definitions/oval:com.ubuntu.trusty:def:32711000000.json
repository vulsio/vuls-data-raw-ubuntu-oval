		"description": "Holger Fuhrmannek discovered an integer overflow in the xsltAddTextString() function in Libxslt. An attacker could use this to craft a malicious document that, when opened, could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possible execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5029)  Nicolas Gregoire discovered that Libxslt mishandled namespace nodes. An attacker could use this to craft a malicious document that, when opened, could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbtrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-1683)  Sebastian Apelt discovered that a use-after-error existed in the xsltDocumentFunctionLoadDocument() function in Libxslt. An attacker could use this to craft a malicious document that, when opened, could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

(CVE-2015-7995)  Nicolas Gregoire discovered the Libxslt mishandled the 'i' and 'a' format tokens for xsl:number data. An attacker could use this to craft a malicious document that, when opened, could cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-1684)  It was discovered that the xsltFormatNumberConversion() function in Libxslt did not properly handle empty decimal separators. An attacker could use this to craft a malicious document that, when opened, could cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.10, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-4738)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3271-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-libxslt1 - 1.1.28-2ubuntu0.1 libxslt1-dev - 1.1.28-2ubuntu0.1 libxslt1.1 - 1.1.28-2ubuntu0.1 xsltproc - 1.1.28-2ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
