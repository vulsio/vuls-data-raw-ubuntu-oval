		"description": "Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register in the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-9322)  An information leak in the Linux kernel was discovered that could leak the high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) paravirt guests. A user in the guest OS could exploit this leak to obtain information that could potentially be used to aid in attacking the kernel. (CVE-2014-8134)  Rabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell King discovered that the ftrace subsystem of the Linux kernel does not properly handle private syscall numbers. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS). (CVE-2014-7826)  A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-3673)  A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). (CVE-2014-3687)  It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3688)  Rabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell Kinglaw discovered a flaw in how the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel handles private systecall numbers. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or bypass ASLR protections via a crafted application. (CVE-2014-7825)  The KVM (kernel virtual machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel miscalculates the number of memory pages during the handling of a mapping failure. A guest OS user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging guest OS privileges. (CVE-2014-8369)  Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register on the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). (CVE-2014-9090)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2446-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-3.13.0-43-generic - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-generic - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-lowlatency - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-43.72 linux-image-3.13.0-43-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-43.72 No subscription required",
