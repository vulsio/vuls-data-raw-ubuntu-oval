		"description": "Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled usernames when using PAM authentication. If an additional vulnerability were discovered in the OpenSSH unprivileged child process, this issue could allow a remote attacker to perform user impersonation. (CVE number pending)  Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled context memory when using PAM authentication. If an additional vulnerability were discovered in the OpenSSH unprivileged child process, this issue could allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE number pending)  Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled time windows for X connections. A remote attacker could use this issue to bypass certain access restrictions. (CVE-2015-5352)  It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled keyboard-interactive authentication. In a non-default configuration, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a brute-force password attack. (CVE-2015-5600)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2710-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openssh-server-udeb - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 openssh-client - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 openssh-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 ssh-askpass-gnome - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 ssh - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 ssh-krb5 - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 openssh-client-udeb - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 openssh-sftp-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2 No subscription required",
