		"description": "It was discovered that the Packet network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22600)  Jürgen Groß discovered that the Xen subsystem within the Linux kernel did not adequately limit the number of events driver domains (unprivileged PV backends) could send to other guest VMs. An attacker in a driver domain could use this to cause a denial of service in other guest VMs. (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)  Jürgen Groß discovered that the Xen network backend driver in the Linux kernel did not adequately limit the amount of queued packets when a guest did not process them. An attacker in a guest VM can use this to cause a denial of service (excessive kernel memory consumption) in the network backend domain. (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)  Szymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain gadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39685)  Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)  Kirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-4155)  Lin Ma discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4202)  Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0330)  It was discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain failure conditions, leading to a stale entry in the file descriptor table. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2022-22942)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5298-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-headers-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1131 - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1131 - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1131 - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1131.104 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
