		"description": "It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not properly ensure that manifest elements were signed before use. An attacker could possibly use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-3136)  Artem Smotrakov discovered that the HTTP client redirection handler implementation in OpenJDK did not clear potentially sensitive information in HTTP headers when following redirections to different hosts. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3139)  It was discovered that the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) implementation in OpenJDK did not properly enforce restrictions specified by system properties in some situations. An attacker could potentially use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-3149)  It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly perform access checks in certain cases when performing field link resolution. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-3169)  Felix DÃ¶rre discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) implementation in OpenJDK did not ensure that the same endpoint identification algorithm was used during TLS session resumption as during initial session setup. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3180)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3824-1` to fix the vulnerability.
