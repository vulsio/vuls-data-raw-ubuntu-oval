		"description": "John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled PGP signature boundaries. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick Module::Signature into parsing the unsigned portion of the SIGNATURE file as the signed portion. (CVE-2015-3406)  John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled files that were not listed in the SIGNATURE file. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code when tests were run. (CVE-2015-3407)  John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled embedded shell commands in the SIGNATURE file. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code during signature verification. (CVE-2015-3408)  John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handled module loading. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code during signature verification. (CVE-2015-3409)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2607-1` to fix the vulnerability.
