		"description": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a Wake- on-Lan data structure. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2014-9900)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to /proc/iomem. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8944)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the performance events and counters subsystem of the Linux kernel for ARM64. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8955)  It was discovered that the SCSI generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel contained a double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-8962)  Sasha Levin discovered that a race condition existed in the performance events and counters subsystem of the Linux kernel when handling CPU unplug events. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8963)  Tilman Schmidt and Sasha Levin discovered a use-after-free condition in the TTY implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2015-8964)  It was discovered that the fcntl64() system call in the Linux kernel did not properly set memory limits when returning on 32-bit ARM processors. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8966)  It was discovered that the system call table for ARM 64-bit processors in the Linux kernel was not write-protected. An attacker could use this in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8967)  It was discovered that the generic SCSI block layer in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict write operations in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-10088)  Alexander Potapenko discovered a race condition in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-1000380)  Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware Virtual GPUs in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some ioctl arguments. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-7346)  Tuomas Haanpää and Ari Kauppi discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly check for the end of buffer. A remote attacker could use this to craft requests that cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7895)  It was discovered that an integer underflow existed in the Edgeport USB Serial Converter device driver of the Linux kernel. An attacker with physical access could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-8924)  It was discovered that the USB ZyXEL omni.net LCD PLUS driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (tty exhaustion). (CVE-2017-8925)  Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware Virtual GPUs in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-9605)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3360-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-3.13.0-125-generic - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-generic - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-lowlatency - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-125.174 linux-image-3.13.0-125-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-125.174 No subscription required",
