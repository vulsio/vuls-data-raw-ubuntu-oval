		"description": "Yuval Yarom, Daniel Genkin, and Nadia Heninger discovered that OpenSSL was vulnerable to a side-channel attack on modular exponentiation. On certain CPUs, a local attacker could possibly use this issue to recover RSA keys. This flaw is known as CacheBleed. (CVE-2016-0702)  Adam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when parsing DSA private keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0705)  Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled hex digit calculation in the BN_hex2bn function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)  Emilia KÃ¤sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when performing SRP user database lookups. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0798)  Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when printing very long strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0799)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2914-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18 No subscription required",
