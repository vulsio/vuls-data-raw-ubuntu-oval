		"description": "Several security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass Same Origin Policy restrictions. (CVE-2015-1253, CVE-2015-1254)  A use-after-free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1255)  A use-after-free was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1256)  A security issue was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1257)  An issue was discovered with the build of libvpx. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1258)  Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in the WebRTC implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1260)  An uninitialized value bug was discovered in the font shaping code in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1262)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1265)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-3910)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2610-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  liboxideqtcore0 - 1.7.8-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 liboxideqt-qmlplugin - 1.7.8-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-chromedriver - 1.7.8-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs-extra - 1.7.8-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqmlscene - 1.7.8-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 oxideqt-codecs - 1.7.8-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 liboxideqtquick0 - 1.7.8-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 No subscription required",
