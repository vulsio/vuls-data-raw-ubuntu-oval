		"description": "It was discovered that GnuTLS did not perform date and time checks on CA certificates, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-8155)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly verified that signature algorithms matched. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade to a disallowed algorithm. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-0282)  It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly verified certificate algorithms. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade to a disallowed algorithm.
