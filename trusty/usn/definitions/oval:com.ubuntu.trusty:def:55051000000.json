		"description": "Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3609)  Likang Luo discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3752)  It was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)  Szymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain gadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39685)  It was discovered that the Ion Memory Manager subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39714)  Eric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation in the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2021-4197)  Lin Ma discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4202)  Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0330)  It was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-1353)  It was discovered that the virtual graphics memory manager implementation in the Linux kernel was subject to a race condition, potentially leading to an information leak. (CVE-2022-1419)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)  It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1679)  It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform cleanup actions on multi-core shared buffers. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21123)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform cleanup actions on microarchitectural fill buffers. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21125)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly perform cleanup during specific special register write operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21166)  It was discovered that the USB Gadget file system interface in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24958)  赵子轩 discovered that the 802.2 LLC type 2 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28356)  It was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28388)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5505-1` to fix the vulnerability.
