		"description": "USN-3690-1 provided updated microcode for AMD processors to address CVE-2017-5715 (aka Spectre). Unfortunately, the update caused some systems to fail to boot. This update reverts the update for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution  and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel  attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to  expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.   This update provides the microcode updates for AMD 17H family  processors required for the corresponding Linux kernel updates.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3690-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  amd64-microcode - 3.20180524.1~ubuntu0.14.04.2+really20130710.1 No subscription required",
