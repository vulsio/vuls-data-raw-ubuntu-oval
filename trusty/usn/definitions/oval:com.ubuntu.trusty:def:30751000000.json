		"description": "Jakub Wilk discovered an out of bounds read in the GIF loader implementation in Imlib2. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-3994)  Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered an off-by-one error when handling coordinates in Imlib2. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2016-3993)  Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that integer overflows existed in Imlib2 when handling images with large dimensions. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion or application crash). (CVE-2014-9771, CVE-2016-4024)  Kevin Ryde discovered that the ellipse drawing code in Imlib2 would attempt to divide by zero when drawing a 2x1 ellipse. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2011-5326)  It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handled GIF images without colormaps. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-9762)  It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handle some PNM images, leading to a division by zero. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-9763)  It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handle error conditions when loading some GIF images. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-9764)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3075-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libimlib2-dev - 1.4.6-2ubuntu0.1 libimlib2 - 1.4.6-2ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
