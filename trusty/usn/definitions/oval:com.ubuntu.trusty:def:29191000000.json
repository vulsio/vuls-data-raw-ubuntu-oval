		"description": "Jacob Baines discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled ICC color profiles in JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2016-1577)  Tyler Hicks discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled memory when processing JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2116)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2919-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libjasper-runtime - 1.900.1-14ubuntu3.3 libjasper-dev - 1.900.1-14ubuntu3.3 libjasper1 - 1.900.1-14ubuntu3.3 No subscription required",
