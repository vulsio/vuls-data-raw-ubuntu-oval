		"description": "It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when parsing DTLS SRTP extension data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-3513)  It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when verifying the integrity of a session ticket. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3567)  In addition, this update introduces support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV). This new feature prevents protocol downgrade attacks when certain applications such as web browsers attempt to reconnect using a lower protocol version for interoperability reasons.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2385-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7 No subscription required",
