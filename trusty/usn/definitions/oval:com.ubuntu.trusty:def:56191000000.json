		"title": "USN-5619-1 -- LibTIFF vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing the calculation of data that would eventually be used as a reference for bound-checking operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-19131)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly terminating a function execution when processing incorrect data. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-19144)  It was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF file using tiffinfo tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1354)  It was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF file using tiffcp tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to      cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1355)  It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to avoid division calculations where the denominator value was zero, which could lead to an undefined behaviour situation via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5619-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libtiff-opengl - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 libtiff-tools - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 libtiff5-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 libtiff4-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 libtiff5-alt-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 libtiff5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 libtiffxx5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 libtiff-doc - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm4 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
