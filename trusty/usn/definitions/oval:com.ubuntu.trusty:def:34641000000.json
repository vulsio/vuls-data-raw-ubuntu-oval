		"description": "Antti Levom√§ki, Christian Jalio, and Joonas Pihlaja discovered that Wget incorrectly handled certain HTTP responses. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Wget to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-13089, CVE-2017-13090)  Dawid Golunski discovered that Wget incorrectly handled recursive or mirroring mode. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass intended access list restrictions. (CVE-2016-7098)  Orange Tsai discovered that Wget incorrectly handled CRLF sequences in HTTP headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject arbitrary HTTP headers. (CVE-2017-6508)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3464-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  wget - 1.15-1ubuntu1.14.04.3 wget-udeb - 1.15-1ubuntu1.14.04.3 No subscription required",
