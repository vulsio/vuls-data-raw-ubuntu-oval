		"description": "Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-2117)  Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-4004)  Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive information. (CVE-2016-2069)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2187)  Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86 processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. (CVE-2016-3672)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3951)  It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-3955)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4485)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4486)  It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-4581)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2989-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-87-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-3.13.0-87-generic - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-3.13.0-87-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-3.13.0-87-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-3.13.0-87-lowlatency - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-3.13.0-87-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-87-generic - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-3.13.0-87-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-87.133 linux-image-3.13.0-87-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-87.133 No subscription required",
