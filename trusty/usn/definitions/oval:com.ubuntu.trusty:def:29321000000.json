		"description": "Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-3134)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4312)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7566)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7833)  It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat- timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8767)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2016-0723)  Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive information. (CVE-2016-2069)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-2384)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2543)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2544)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2545)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2546)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2547, CVE-2016-2548)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2016-2549)  Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2782)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2932-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-extra-3.19.0-56-generic - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-56-generic-lpae - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-56-powerpc-smp - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-56-powerpc-e500mc - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-56-lowlatency - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-56-powerpc64-emb - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-56-powerpc64-smp - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 linux-image-3.19.0-56-generic - 3.19.0-56.62~14.04.1 No subscription required",
