		"description": "It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Bluetooth stack of the Linux kernel when handling L2CAP configuration responses. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-1000251)  It was discovered that the asynchronous I/O (aio) subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly set permissions on aio memory mappings in some situations. An attacker could use this to more easily exploit other vulnerabilities. (CVE-2016-10044)  Baozeng Ding and Andrey Konovalov discovered a race condition in the L2TPv3 IP Encapsulation implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-10200)  Andreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a setxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group privileges. (CVE-2016-7097)  Sergej Schumilo, Ralf Spenneberg, and Hendrik Schwartke discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-8650)  Vlad Tsyrklevich discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the VFIO PCI driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to a vfio PCI device file could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9083, CVE-2016-9084)  It was discovered that an information leak existed in __get_user_asm_ex() in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2016-9178)  CAI Qian discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations. An unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2016-9191)  It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel in some situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined by userspace keyrings. A privileged local attacker could use this to bypass module verification. (CVE-2016-9604)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the trace subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-9754)  Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle invalid IP options in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5970)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle TCP packets with the URG flag. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-6214)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the AF_PACKET handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-6346)  It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict searches for dead keys. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-6951)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the generic SCSI (sg) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker with access to an sg device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7187)  Eric Biggers discovered a memory leak in the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). (CVE-2017-7472)  It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Broadcom FullMAC WLAN driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7541)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3422-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-132-lowlatency - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-3.13.0-132-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-132-generic - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-3.13.0-132-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-3.13.0-132-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-3.13.0-132-generic - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-3.13.0-132-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-3.13.0-132-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-132.181 linux-image-3.13.0-132-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-132.181 No subscription required",
