		"description": "Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted sessions. This update causes NSS to limit use of the same symmetric key. (CVE-2016-2183)  It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled Base64 decoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause NSS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5461)  This update refreshes the NSS package to version 3.28.4 which includes the latest CA certificate bundle.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3270-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libnss3-nssdb - 2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 libnss3-dev - 2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 libnss3 - 2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 libnss3-1d - 2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 libnss3-tools - 2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 No subscription required",
