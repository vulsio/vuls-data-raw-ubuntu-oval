		"description": "USN-3696-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18255)  Wei Fang discovered an integer overflow in the F2FS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-18257)  It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-1000204)  It was discovered that the wait4() system call in the Linux kernel did not properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-10087)  It was discovered that the kill() system call implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-10124)  Julian Stecklina and Thomas Prescher discovered that FPU register states (such as MMX, SSE, and AVX registers) which are lazily restored are potentially vulnerable to a side channel attack. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3665)  Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-errors existed in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5814)  It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-7755)  Seunghun Han discovered an information leak in the ACPI handling code in the Linux kernel when handling early termination of ACPI table loading. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive informal (kernel address locations). (CVE-2017-13695)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-10021)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3696-2` to fix the vulnerability.
