		"description": "USN-3212-1 fixed vulnerabilities in LibTIFF. Unfortunately, some of the security patches were misapplied, which caused a regression when processing certain images. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed  images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially  crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a  denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3212-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libtiff-opengl - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 libtiff-tools - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 libtiff5-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 libtiff4-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 libtiff5-alt-dev - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 libtiff5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 libtiffxx5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 libtiff-doc - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.7 No subscription required",
