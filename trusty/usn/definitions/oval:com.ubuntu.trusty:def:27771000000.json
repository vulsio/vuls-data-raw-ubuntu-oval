		"description": "It was discovered that virtio networking in the Linux kernel did not handle fragments correctly, leading to kernel memory corruption. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-5156)  Benjamin Randazzo discovered an information leak in the md (multiple device) driver when the bitmap_info.file is disabled. A local privileged attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel. (CVE-2015-5697)  Marc-Andr√© Lureau discovered that the vhost driver did not properly release the userspace provided log file descriptor. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2015-6252)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify sockets were properly bound before attempting to send a message, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-6937)  Ben Hutchings discovered that the Advanced Union Filesystem (aufs) for the Linux kernel did not correctly handle references of memory mapped files from an aufs mount. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-7312)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2777-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.16.0-51-generic-lpae - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-3.16.0-51-generic - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-51-powerpc-smp - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-51-generic - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-51-powerpc-e500mc - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-51-powerpc64-emb - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-51-lowlatency - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-51-powerpc64-smp - 3.16.0-51.69~14.04.1 No subscription required",
