		"description": "It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not correctly perform merging of multiple sections for the same file listed in JAR archive file manifests. An attacker could possibly use this to modify attributes in a manifest without invalidating the signature. (CVE-2018-2790)  Francesco Palmarini, Marco Squarcina, Mauro Tempesta, and Riccardo Focardi discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not restrict which classes could be used when deserializing keys from the JCEKS key stores. An attacker could use this to specially craft a JCEKS key store to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-2794)  It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK in some situations did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-2795)  It was discovered that the Concurrency component of OpenJDK in some situations did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-2796)  It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK in some situations did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-2797)  It was discovered that the AWT component of OpenJDK in some situations did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-2798)  It was discovered that the JAXP component of OpenJDK in some situations did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-2799)  Moritz Bechler discovered that the RMI component of OpenJDK enabled HTTP transport for RMI servers by default. A remote attacker could use this to gain access to restricted services. (CVE-2018-2800)  It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the Hotspot component of OpenJDK affecting confidentiality, data integrity, and availability. An attacker could use this to specially craft an Java application that caused a denial of service or bypassed sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2814)  Apostolos Giannakidis discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not properly bound memory allocations in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-2815)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3691-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-7-jre-zero - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-source - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 icedtea-7-jre-jamvm - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-tests - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-jre-lib - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-jdk - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-jre-headless - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-jre - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-demo - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 openjdk-7-doc - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1 No subscription required",
