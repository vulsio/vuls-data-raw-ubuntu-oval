		"description": "It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-2647)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-10902)  It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-12896)  Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14734)  It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-16276)  Tetsuo Handa discovered a logic error in the TTY subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to pseudo terminal devices could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-18386)  Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-18690)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-18710)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3849-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-164-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-3.13.0-164-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-3.13.0-164-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-3.13.0-164-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-3.13.0-164-lowlatency - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-3.13.0-164-generic - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-3.13.0-164-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-164-generic - 3.13.0-164.214 linux-image-3.13.0-164-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-164.214 No subscription required",
