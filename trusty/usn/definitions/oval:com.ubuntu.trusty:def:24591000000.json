		"description": "Pieter Wuille discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled Bignum squaring. (CVE-2014-3570)  Markus Stenberg discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain crafted DTLS messages. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)  Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain handshakes. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade to ECDH, removing forward secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)  Antti Karjalainen, Tuomo Untinen and Konrad Kraszewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain certificate fingerprints. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to trick certain applications that rely on the uniqueness of fingerprints. (CVE-2014-8275)  Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain key exchanges. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade the security of the session to EXPORT_RSA. (CVE-2015-0204)  Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled client authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to authenticate without the use of a private key in certain limited scenarios. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. (CVE-2015-0205)  Chris Mueller discovered that OpenSSL incorrect handled memory when processing DTLS records. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. (CVE-2015-0206)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2459-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8 No subscription required",
