		"description": "USN-5964-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in curl. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.  Original advisory details:   Harry Sintonen discovered that curl incorrectly handled certain TELNET  connection options. Due to lack of proper input scrubbing, curl could pass  on user name and telnet options to the server as provided, contrary to  expectations. (CVE-2023-27533)   Harry Sintonen discovered that curl incorrectly reused certain FTP  connections. This could lead to the wrong credentials being reused,  contrary to expectations. (CVE-2023-27535)   Harry Sintonen discovered that curl incorrectly reused connections when the  GSS delegation option had been changed. This could lead to the option being  reused, contrary to expectations. (CVE-2023-27536)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5964-2` to fix the vulnerability.
