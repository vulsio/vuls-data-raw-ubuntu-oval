		"description": "Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory allocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to potential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42703)  It was discovered that the video4linux driver for Empia based TV cards in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3239)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3524)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3564)  It was discovered that the ISDN implementation of the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3565)  It was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3566)  It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)  It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8152 USB Ethernet adapter driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3594)  It was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3621)  It was discovered that the IDT 77252 ATM PCI device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly remove any pending timers during device exit, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3635)  Khalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3649)  Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX storage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-40768)  It was discovered that the USB monitoring (usbmon) component in the Linux kernel did not properly set permissions on memory mapped in to user space processes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43750)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5758-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-modules-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-headers-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-image-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-tools-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-aws-headers-4.4.0-1114 - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-aws-tools-4.4.0-1114 - 4.4.0-1114.120 linux-aws-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1114 - 4.4.0-1114.120 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-cloud-tools-4.4.0-235 - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-tools-4.4.0-235 - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-235 - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-tools-aws - 4.4.0.1114.111 linux-aws - 4.4.0.1114.111 linux-headers-aws - 4.4.0.1114.111 linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1114.111 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-cloud-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-cloud-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-image-extra-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-signed-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-headers-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-signed-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-cloud-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-signed-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-headers-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-signed-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-headers-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.235.204 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
