		"description": "USN-3344-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  USN 3334-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Linux kernel. However, that fix introduced regressions for some Java applications. This update addresses the issue. We apologize for the inconvenience.  Roee Hay discovered that the parallel port printer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly bounds check passed arguments. A local attacker with write access to the kernel command line arguments could use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-1000363)  A reference count bug was discovered in the Linux kernel ipx protocol stack. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-7487)  It was discovered that a double-free vulnerability existed in the IPv4 stack of the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-8890)  Andrey Konovalov discovered an IPv6 out-of-bounds read error in the Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9074)  Andrey Konovalov discovered a flaw in the handling of inheritance in the Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9075)  It was discovered that dccp v6 in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9076)  It was discovered that the transmission control protocol (tcp) v6 in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-9077)  It was discovered that the IPv6 stack in the Linux kernel was performing its over write consistency check after the data was actually overwritten. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-9242)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3344-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-83-generic - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-83-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-83-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-83-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-4.4.0-83-generic - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-83-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-83-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-83-lowlatency - 4.4.0-83.106~14.04.1 No subscription required",
