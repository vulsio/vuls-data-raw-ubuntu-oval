		"description": "USN-3654-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. (CVE-2018-3639)  Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007 driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17975)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18193)  It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-18222)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-1065)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly validate ebtables offsets. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-1068)  It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1130)  It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-5803)  It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7480)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-7757)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7995)  Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8781)  Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8822)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3654-2` to fix the vulnerability.
