		"description": "Matthew Daley reported an information leak in the floppy disk driver of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1738)  Matthew Daley reported a flaw in the handling of ioctl commands by the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges if the floppy disk module is loaded. (CVE-2014-1737)  A flaw was discovered in the handling of network packets when mergeable buffers are disabled for virtual machines in the Linux kernel. Guest OS users may exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly gain privilege on the host OS. (CVE-2014-0077)  Török Edwin discovered a flaw with Xen netback driver when used with Linux configurations that do not allow sleeping in softirq context. A guest administrator could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the host. (CVE-2014-2580)  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's ping sockets. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application. (CVE-2014-2851)  Hannes Frederic Sowa reported a hash collision ordering problem in the xfs filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause filesystem corruption and a denial of service (oops or panic). (CVE-2014-7283)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2226-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-27-generic - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-3.13.0-27-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-3.13.0-27-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-3.13.0-27-lowlatency - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-3.13.0-27-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-27-generic - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-3.13.0-27-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-3.13.0-27-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-27.50 linux-image-3.13.0-27-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-27.50 No subscription required",
