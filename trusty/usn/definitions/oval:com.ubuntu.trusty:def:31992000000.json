		"description": "USN-3199-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Python Cryptography Toolkit. Unfortunately, various programs depended on the original behavior of the Python Cryptography Toolkit which was altered when fixing the vulnerability. This update retains the fix for the vulnerability but issues a warning rather than throwing an exception. Code which produces this warning should be updated because future versions of the Python Cryptography Toolkit re-introduce the exception.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the ALGnew function in block_template.c in the Python  Cryptography Toolkit contained a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.  A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code by using  a crafted initialization vector parameter.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3199-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  python-crypto-doc - 2.6.1-4ubuntu0.2 python3-crypto - 2.6.1-4ubuntu0.2 python-crypto - 2.6.1-4ubuntu0.2 No subscription required",
