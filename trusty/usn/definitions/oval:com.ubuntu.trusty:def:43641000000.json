		"description": "It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19060)  It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl() calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-10942)  It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)  It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)  It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11608)  It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11609)  It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11668)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4364-1` to fix the vulnerability.
