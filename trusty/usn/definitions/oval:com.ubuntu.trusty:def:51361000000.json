		"description": "It was discovered that the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19449)  It was discovered that the FUSE user space file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-36322)  It was discovered that the Infiniband RDMA userspace connection manager implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possible execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-36385)  Ilja Van Sprundel discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform size validations on incoming packets in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-3655)  It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3743)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3753)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly account for the memory usage of certain IPC objects. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3759)  Michael Wakabayashi discovered that the NFSv4 client implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly order connection setup operations. An attacker controlling a remote NFS server could use this to cause a denial of service on the client. (CVE-2021-38199)  It was discovered that the Aspeed Low Pin Count (LPC) Bus Controller implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform boundary checks in some situations, allowing out-of-bounds write access. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. In Ubuntu, this issue only affected systems running armhf kernels. (CVE-2021-42252)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5136-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1126 - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1126 - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1126 - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1126.99 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
