		"description": "It was discovered that the virtual file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained an unsigned to signed integer conversion error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33909)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce limits for pointer operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33200)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation did not properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24586)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled encrypted fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to decrypt fragments. (CVE-2020-24587)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders. A physically proximate attacker could inject malicious packets to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-26139)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation could reassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)  It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform access control. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129)  Or Cohen and Nadav Markus discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the nfc implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23134)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent speculative loads in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-31829)  It was discovered that a race condition in the kernel Bluetooth subsystem could lead to use-after-free of slab objects. An attacker could use this issue to possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-32399)  It was discovered that a use-after-free existed in the Bluetooth HCI driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33034)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5018-1` to fix the vulnerability.
