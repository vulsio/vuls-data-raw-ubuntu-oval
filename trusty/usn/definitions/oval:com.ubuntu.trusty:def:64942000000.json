		"description": "Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-31085)  Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39189)  Sunjoo Park discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate u32 packets content, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39192)  Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SCTP data, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39193)  Lucas Leong discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle state filters, leading to an out- of-bounds read vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39194)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in certain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-42754)  It was discovered that the USB ENE card reader driver in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate enough memory when processing the storage device boot blocks. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-45862)  Manfred Rudigier discovered that the Intel(R) PCI-Express Gigabit (igb) Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate received frames that are larger than the set MTU size, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45871)  Budimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5717)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6494-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1172 - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1172 - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1172 - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1172-azure - 4.15.0-1172.187~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1172.138 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
