		"description": "It was discovered that the VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle attempts to access disabled memory spaces. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12888)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation did not properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets. (CVE-2020-26141)  Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel’s WiFi implementation accepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Atheros Ath9k WiFi driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (WiFi network traffic). (CVE-2020-3702)  It was discovered a race condition existed in the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-0920)  It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-0935)  Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)  Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)  It was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-37159)  It was discovered that the network packet filtering implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize information in certain circumstances. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-39636)  Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)  Luo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42739)  Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-43976)  Amit Klein discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel could disclose internal state in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-45486)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5361-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-tools-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-aws-headers-4.4.0-1103 - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-modules-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-aws-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1103 - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-aws-tools-4.4.0-1103 - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-headers-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108 linux-image-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-modules-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.4.0-223 - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-tools-4.4.0-223 - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-lts-xenial-cloud-tools-4.4.0-223 - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-tools-aws - 4.4.0.1103.101 linux-aws - 4.4.0.1103.101 linux-headers-aws - 4.4.0.1103.101 linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1103.101 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-cloud-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-signed-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-image-extra-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-headers-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-signed-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-signed-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-headers-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-signed-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-headers-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-cloud-tools-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-tools-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-cloud-tools-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.223.194 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
