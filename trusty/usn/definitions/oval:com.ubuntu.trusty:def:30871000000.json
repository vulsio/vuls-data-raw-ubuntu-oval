		"description": "Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6304)  Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update. (CVE-2016-2177)  CÃ©sar Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing attack and recover private DSA keys. (CVE-2016-2178)  Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2179)  Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the TS_OBJ_print_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2180)  It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2181)  Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2182)  Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM. (CVE-2016-2183)  Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6302)  Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the MDC2_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6303)  Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6306)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3087-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20 No subscription required",
