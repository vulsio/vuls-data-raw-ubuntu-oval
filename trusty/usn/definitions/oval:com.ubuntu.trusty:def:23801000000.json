		"description": "Michal Zalewski discovered that Bash incorrectly handled parsing certain function definitions. If an attacker were able to create an environment variable containing a function definition with a very specific name, these issues could possibly be used to bypass certain environment restrictions and execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278)  Please note that the previous Bash security update, USN-2364-1, includes a hardening measure that prevents these issues from being used in a Shellshock attack.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2380-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  bash-builtins - 4.3-7ubuntu1.5 bash-doc - 4.3-7ubuntu1.5 bash - 4.3-7ubuntu1.5 bash-static - 4.3-7ubuntu1.5 No subscription required",
