		"description": "Zhenpeng Lin discovered that the network packet scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly remove all references to a route filter before freeing it in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2588)  It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not prevent one nft object from referencing an nft set in another nft table, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2586)  It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-0494)  Hu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1048)  It was discovered that the implementation of the 6pack and mkiss protocols in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1195)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)  It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1679)  Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)  It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)  Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1974)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic context operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1975)  Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-33981)  Arthur Mongodin discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data validation. A local attacker could use this to escalate privileges in certain situations. (CVE-2022-34918)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5560-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1149 - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1149 - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1149 - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1149.118 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
