		"description": "It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when processing PDF files. If a user or automated system using ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-20224)  Zhang Xiaohui discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when processing image data. If a user or automated system using ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20241)  Zhang Xiaohui discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when processing image data. If a user or automated system using ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20243)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when processing visual effects based image files. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could crash the application causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20244)  It was discovered that ImageMagick could be made to divide by zero when processing crafted files. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could crash the application causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20245)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when performing resampling operations. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could crash the application causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20246)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when processing visual effects based image files. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could crash the application causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20309)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when processing thumbnail image data. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could crash the application causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20312)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled memory cleanup when performing certain cryptographic operations. Under certain conditions sensitive cryptographic information could be disclosed. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-20313)  It was discovered that ImageMagick did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file using the convert command, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ImageMagick to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-3574)  It was discovered that ImageMagick did not use the correct rights when specifically excluded by a module policy. An attacker could use this issue to read and write certain restricted files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-39212)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values when processing specially crafted SVG files. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted SVG file, an attacker could crash the application causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-4219)  It was discovered that ImageMagick did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted DICOM file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ImageMagick to crash, resulting in a denial of servicei, or expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-1114)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled memory under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-28463)  It was discovered that ImageMagick incorrectly handled certain values. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted image file, an attacker could possibly exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.
