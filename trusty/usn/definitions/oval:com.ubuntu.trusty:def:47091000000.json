		"description": "It was discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation in the Linux kernel performed insufficient identifier checking in certain XCOPY requests. An attacker with access to at least one LUN in a multiple backstore environment could use this to expose sensitive information or modify data. (CVE-2020-28374)  Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly track inode validations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-13093)  It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate file system metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816)  Bodong Zhao discovered a use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25669)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4709-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1085-aws - 4.4.0-1085.89 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1085.82 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
