		"description": "It was discovered that the X.Org X server incorrectly handled endianness conversion of certain X events. An attacker able to connect to an X server, either locally or remotely, could use this issue to crash the server, or possibly execute arbitrary code as an administrator. (CVE-2017-10971)  It was discovered that the X.Org X server incorrectly handled endianness conversion of certain X events. An attacker able to connect to an X server, either locally or remotely, could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive information.
