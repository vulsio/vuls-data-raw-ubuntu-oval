Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the Python email module incorrectly parsed email  addresses that contain special characters. A remote attacker could  possibly use this issue to bypass certain protection mechanisms.  (CVE-2023-27043)    It was discovered that Python allowed excessive backtracking while parsing  certain tarfile headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue  to cause Python to consume resources, leading to a denial of service.  (CVE-2024-6232)    It was discovered that the Python email module incorrectly quoted newlines  for email headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to  perform header injection. (CVE-2024-6923)    It was discovered that the Python http.cookies module incorrectly handled  parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters. A remote  attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Python to consume  resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2024-7592)    It was discovered that the Python zipfile module incorrectly handled  certain malformed zip files. A remote attacker could possibly use this  issue to cause Python to stop responding, resulting in a denial of  service.
