		"description": "Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3609)  It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly track bounds information for 32 bit registers when performing div and mod operations. A local attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3600)  Or Cohen discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23133)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5003-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-1118-azure - 4.15.0-1118.131~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1118.91 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
