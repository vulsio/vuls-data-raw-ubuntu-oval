		"description": "Felix Wilhelm discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform input validation in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-15471)  It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges. (CVE-2017-13168)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-16658)  It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-9363)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3820-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-azure - 4.15.0-1031.32~14.04.1 No subscription required",
