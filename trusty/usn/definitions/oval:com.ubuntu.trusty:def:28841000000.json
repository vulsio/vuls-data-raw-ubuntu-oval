		"description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure, data integrity, and availability. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service, expose sensitive data over the network, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0483, CVE-2016-0494)  A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to data integrity. An attacker could exploit this to expose sensitive data over the network or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0402)  It was discovered that OpenJDK 7 incorrectly allowed MD5 to be used for TLS connections. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-7575)  A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure. An attacker could exploit this to expose sensitive data over the network. (CVE-2016-0448)  A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to availability. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0466)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2884-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openjdk-7-jre-zero - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 openjdk-7-source - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 icedtea-7-jre-jamvm - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jre-lib - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jdk - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jre-headless - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 openjdk-7-jre - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 openjdk-7-demo - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 openjdk-7-doc - 7u95-2.6.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 No subscription required",
