		"description": "It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled bulk transfers from SPICE clients. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-3682)  It was discovered that QEMU did not properly manage memory when it transfers the USB packets. A malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-3750)  It was discovered that the QEMU SCSI device emulation incorrectly handled certain MODE SELECT commands.
