		"description": "USN-4162-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  It was discovered that the RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not did not handle detach operations correctly, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-21008)  Wen Huang discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a heap overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816)  Matt Delco discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking when handling coalesced MMIO write operations. A local attacker with write access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-14821)  Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15117)  Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the Linux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15118)  It was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15505)  Brad Spengler discovered that a Spectre mitigation was improperly implemented in the ptrace susbsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15902)  It was discovered that the SMB networking file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15918)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4162-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-1061-azure - 4.15.0-1061.66~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1061.47 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
