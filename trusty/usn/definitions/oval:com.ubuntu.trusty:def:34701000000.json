		"description": "Qian Zhang discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the tipc_msg_build() function in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-8632)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the timerfd subsystem of the Linux kernel when handling might_cancel queuing. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10661)  It was discovered that the Flash-Friendly File System (f2fs) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate superblock metadata. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10662, CVE-2017-10663)  Anthony Perard discovered that the Xen virtual block driver did not properly initialize some data structures before passing them to user space. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2017-10911)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the POSIX message queue implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-11176)  Dave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not enforce that the realtime inode flag was settable only on filesystems on a realtime device. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14340)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3470-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-135-lowlatency - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-3.13.0-135-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-3.13.0-135-generic - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-3.13.0-135-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-135-generic - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-3.13.0-135-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-3.13.0-135-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-3.13.0-135-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-135.184 linux-image-3.13.0-135-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-135.184 No subscription required",
