		"description": "An uninitialized value issue was discovered in ICU. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1270)  A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1272)  A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1276)  A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implemetation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1277)  A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1280)  It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. (CVE-2015-1281)  Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1283)  It was discovered that Blink did not enforce a page's maximum number of  frames in some circumstances, resulting in a use-after-free. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1284)  It was discovered that the XSS auditor in Blink did not properly choose a truncation point. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-1285)  An issue was discovered in the CSS implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-1287)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1289)  A use-after-free was discovered in oxide::qt::URLRequestDelegatedJob in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1329)  A crash was discovered in the regular expression implementation in V8 in some circumstances.
