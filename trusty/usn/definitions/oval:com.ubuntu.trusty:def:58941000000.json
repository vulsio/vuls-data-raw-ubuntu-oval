		"description": "Harry Sintonen and Tomas Hoger discovered that curl incorrectly handled TELNET connections when the -t option was used on the command line. Uninitialized data possibly containing sensitive information could be sent to the remote server, contrary to expectations. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 14.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-22898, CVE-2021-22925)  It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled denials when using HTTP proxies. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43552)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5894-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 libcurl3-gnutls - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 libcurl4-doc - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 libcurl3-nss - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 libcurl3 - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 curl - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
