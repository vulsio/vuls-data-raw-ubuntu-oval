		"title": "USN-2888-1 -- Linux kernel (Utopic HWE) vulnerabilities",
		"description": "It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use crafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2013-7446)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in the host (system crash). (CVE-2015-7513)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race between read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7550)  Sasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7990)  It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8374)  郭永刚 discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)  David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2888-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc64-emb - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-60-lowlatency - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-60-generic - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-60-generic-lpae - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc-e500mc - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc64-smp - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 linux-image-extra-3.16.0-60-generic - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 linux-image-3.16.0-60-powerpc-smp - 3.16.0-60.80~14.04.1 No subscription required",
