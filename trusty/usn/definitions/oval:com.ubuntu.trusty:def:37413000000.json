		"title": "USN-3741-3 -- Linux kernel regressions",
		"description": "USN-3741-1 introduced mitigations in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to address L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646). Unfortunately, the update introduced regressions that caused kernel panics when booting in some environments as well as preventing Java applications from starting. This update fixes the problems.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU  core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU  core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local  attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive  information (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)   It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU  core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU  core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local  attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the  kernel or other processes). (CVE-2018-3620)   Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel  performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when  handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a  denial of service. (CVE-2018-5390)   Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel  performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when  handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5391)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3741-3` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-156-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-3.13.0-156-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-3.13.0-156-generic - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-3.13.0-156-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-3.13.0-156-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-156-generic - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-3.13.0-156-lowlatency - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-3.13.0-156-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-156.206 linux-image-3.13.0-156-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-156.206 No subscription required",
