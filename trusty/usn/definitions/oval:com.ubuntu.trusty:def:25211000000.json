		"description": "Several out-of-bounds write bugs were discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1213, CVE-2015-1214, CVE-2015-1215)  A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1216)  Multiple type confusion bugs were discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1217, CVE-2015-1230)  Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1218, CVE-2015-1223)  An integer overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1219)  A use-after-free was discovered in the GIF image decoder in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1220)  A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1221)  Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the service worker implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1222)  An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the VPX decoder implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1224)  It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for image drawing in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2015-1227)  It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for a data structure in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1228)  It was discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct session-fixation attacks. (CVE-2015-1229)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1231)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-2238)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2521-1` to fix the vulnerability.
