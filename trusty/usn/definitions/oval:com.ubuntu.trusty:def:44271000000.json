		"description": "It was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19947)  Chuhong Yuan discovered that go7007 USB audio device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some failure conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20810)  Jason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict loading SSDT code from an EFI variable. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown restrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel. (CVE-2019-20908)  It was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-10732)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) mitigations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-10766)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) mitigations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-10767)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel could incorrectly enable Indirect Branch Speculation after it has been disabled for a process via a prctl() call. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-10768)  Mauricio Faria de Oliveira discovered that the aufs implementation in the Linux kernel improperly managed inode reference counts in the vfsub_dentry_open() method. A local attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-11935)  It was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use this to have an unspecified impact. (CVE-2020-13974)  It was discovered that the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel did not handle memory allocation failures during early boot in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-12380)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4427-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1075-aws - 4.4.0-1075.79 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-4.4.0-186-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-186.216~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-186-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-186.216~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-186-generic - 4.4.0-186.216~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-186-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-186.216~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-186-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-186.216~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-186-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-186.216~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-186-lowlatency - 4.4.0-186.216~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1075.72 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-powerpc64-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 linux-image-powerpc-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 linux-image-powerpc64-emb-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 linux-image-powerpc-e500mc-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.186.163 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
