		"description": "It was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1079)  Jana Hofmann, Emanuele Vannacci, Cedric Fournet, Boris Kopf, and Oleksii Oleksenko discovered that some AMD processors could leak stale data from division operations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20588)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when performing operations with kernel objects, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45863)  It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the server frame size in certain situation, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious CIFS image that, when operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-6606)  Budimir Markovic, Lucas De Marchi, and Pengfei Xu discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate all event sizes when attaching new events, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6931)  It was discovered that the IGMP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6932)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-6604-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-headers-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1173 - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1173 - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1173 - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1173-azure - 4.15.0-1173.188~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 linux-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1173.139 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
