		"description": "It was discovered that dpkg incorrectly handled certain patches when unpacking source packages. If a user or an automated system were tricked into unpacking a specially crafted source package, a remote attacker could modify files outside the target unpack directory, leading to a denial of service or potentially gaining access to the system.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2242-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  dpkg-dev - 1.17.5ubuntu5.3 dselect - 1.17.5ubuntu5.3 dpkg - 1.17.5ubuntu5.3 libdpkg-dev - 1.17.5ubuntu5.3 libdpkg-perl - 1.17.5ubuntu5.3 No subscription required",
