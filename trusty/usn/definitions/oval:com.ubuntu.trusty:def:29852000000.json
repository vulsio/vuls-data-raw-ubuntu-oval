		"description": "USN-2985-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library. The fix for CVE-2014-9761 introduced a regression which affected applications that use the libm library but were not fully restarted after the upgrade. This update removes the fix for CVE-2014-9761 and a future update will be provided to address this issue.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Martin Carpenter discovered that pt_chown in the GNU C Library did not  properly check permissions for tty files. A local attacker could use this  to gain administrative privileges or expose sensitive information.  (CVE-2013-2207, CVE-2016-2856)    Robin Hack discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in  the GNU C Library did not properly manage its file descriptors. An attacker  could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).  (CVE-2014-8121)    Joseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle long  arguments to functions returning a representation of Not a Number (NaN). An  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion  leading to an application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2014-9761)    Arjun Shankar discovered that in certain situations the nss_dns code in the  GNU C Library did not properly account buffer sizes when passed an  unaligned buffer. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-1781)    Sumit Bose and Lukas Slebodnik discovered that the Name Service  Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not handle long  lines in the files databases correctly. A local attacker could use  this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-5277)    Adam Nielsen discovered that the strftime function in the GNU C Library did  not properly handle out-of-range argument data. An attacker could use this  to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly expose  sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8776)    Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the GNU C Library allowed  the pointer-guarding protection mechanism to be disabled by honoring the  LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable across privilege boundaries. A local  attacker could use this to exploit an existing vulnerability more easily.  (CVE-2015-8777)    Szabolcs Nagy discovered that the hcreate functions in the GNU C Library  did not properly check its size argument, leading to an integer overflow.  An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (application crash) or  possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8778)    Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the  catopen function in the GNU C Library when handling long catalog names. An  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or  possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8779)    Florian Weimer discovered that the getnetbyname implementation in the GNU C  Library did not properly handle long names passed as arguments. An attacker  could use to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an  application crash). (CVE-2016-3075)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2985-2` to fix the vulnerability.
