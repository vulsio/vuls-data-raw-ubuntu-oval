		"description": "It was discovered that the resolver in Bind made incorrect assumptions about ordering when processing responses containing a CNAME or DNAME. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-3137)  Oleg Gorokhov discovered that in some situations, Bind did not properly handle DNS64 queries. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-3136)  Mike Lalumiere discovered that in some situations, Bind did not properly handle invalid operations requested via its control channel.
