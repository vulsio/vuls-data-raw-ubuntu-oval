		"description": "USN-2183-1 fixed a vulnerability in dpkg. Javier Serrano Polo discovered that the fix introduced a vulnerability in releases with an older version of the patch utility. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Jakub Wilk discovered that dpkg incorrectly certain paths and symlinks when  unpacking source packages. If a user or an automated system were tricked  into unpacking a specially crafted source package, a remote attacker could  modify files outside the target unpack directory, leading to a denial of  service or potentially gaining access to the system.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2183-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  dpkg-dev - 1.17.5ubuntu5.2 dselect - 1.17.5ubuntu5.2 dpkg - 1.17.5ubuntu5.2 libdpkg-dev - 1.17.5ubuntu5.2 libdpkg-perl - 1.17.5ubuntu5.2 No subscription required",
