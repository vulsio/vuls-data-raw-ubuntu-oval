		"description": "USN-3575-1 fixed vulnerabilities in QEMU. The fix for CVE-2017-11334 caused a regression in Xen environments. This update removes the problematic fix pending further investigation.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled guest ram. A privileged  attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,  resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2017-11334)    David Buchanan discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the VGA device. A  privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to  crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue was only addressed in  Ubuntu 17.10. (CVE-2017-13672)    Thomas Garnier discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled multiboot. An  attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial  of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host. In the default  installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt, attackers would be isolated  by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to  cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-15289)    Cyrille Chatras discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain PS2 values  during migration. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU  to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary  code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10.  (CVE-2017-16845)    It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Virtio Vring  implementation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to  crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu  16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10. (CVE-2017-17381)    Eric Blake discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain rounding  operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to  crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu  14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2017-18043)    Jiang Xin and Lin ZheCheng discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the  VGA device. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to  cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
