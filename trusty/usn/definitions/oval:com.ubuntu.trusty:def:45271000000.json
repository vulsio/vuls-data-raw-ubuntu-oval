		"description": "It was discovered that the Conexant 23885 TV card device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19054)  It was discovered that the Atheros HTC based wireless driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074)  Yue Haibing discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting in sysfs for network devices in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-20811)  It was discovered that the F2FS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-9445)  It was discovered that the F2FS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate xattr meta data in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds read. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious F2FS image that, when mounted, could expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-9453)  It was discovered that the F2FS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking on xattrs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-0067)  It was discovered that the NFS client implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking before copying security labels in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25212)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4527-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.4.0-1078-aws - 4.4.0-1078.82 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-4.4.0-190-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-190.220~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-190-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-190.220~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-190-lowlatency - 4.4.0-190.220~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-190-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-190.220~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-190-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-190.220~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-190-generic - 4.4.0-190.220~14.04.1 linux-image-4.4.0-190-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-190.220~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-aws - 4.4.0.1078.75 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-powerpc-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 linux-image-lowlatency-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 linux-image-powerpc64-smp-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 linux-image-powerpc64-emb-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 linux-image-generic-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 linux-image-powerpc-e500mc-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 linux-image-virtual-lts-xenial - 4.4.0.190.166 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
