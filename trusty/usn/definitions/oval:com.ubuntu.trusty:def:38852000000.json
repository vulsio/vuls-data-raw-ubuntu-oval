		"description": "USN-3885-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2019-6111 turned out to be incomplete. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Harry Sintonen discovered multiple issues in the OpenSSH scp utility. If a  user or automated system were tricked into connecting to an untrusted  server, a remote attacker could possibly use these issues to write to  arbitrary files, change directory permissions, and spoof client output.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3885-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openssh-server-udeb - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 openssh-client - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 openssh-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 ssh-askpass-gnome - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 ssh - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 ssh-krb5 - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 openssh-client-udeb - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 openssh-sftp-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.13 No subscription required",
