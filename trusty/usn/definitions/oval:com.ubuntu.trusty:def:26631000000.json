		"description": "Alexandre Oliva reported a race condition flaw in the btrfs file system's handling of extended attributes (xattrs). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to bypass ACLs and potentially escalate privileges. (CVE-2014-9710)  A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's file_handle size verification. A local user could exploit this flaw to read potentially sensative memory locations. (CVE-2015-1420)  A underflow error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. (CVE-2015-4001)  A bounds check error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. (CVE-2015-4002)  A division by zero error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4003)  Carl H Lunde discovered missing consistency checks in the Linux kernel's UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by using a corrupted file system image. (CVE-2015-4167)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2663-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-extra-3.13.0-57-generic - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-3.13.0-57-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-3.13.0-57-lowlatency - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-3.13.0-57-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-57.95 linux-image-3.13.0-57-generic - 3.13.0-57.95 No subscription required",
