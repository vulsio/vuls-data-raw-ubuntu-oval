		"description": "It was discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation in the Linux kernel performed insufficient identifier checking in certain XCOPY requests. An attacker with access to at least one LUN in a multiple backstore environment could use this to expose sensitive information or modify data. (CVE-2020-28374)  Kiyin (尹亮) discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25704)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4711-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-1106-azure - 4.15.0-1106.118~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1106.79 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
