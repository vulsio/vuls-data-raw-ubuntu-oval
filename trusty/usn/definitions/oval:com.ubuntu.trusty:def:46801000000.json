		"description": "It was discovered that debugfs in the Linux kernel as used by blktrace contained a use-after-free in some situations. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19770)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the binder IPC implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-0423)  Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen discovered that legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in the Bluetooth protocol could allow an unauthenticated user to complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. A physically proximate attacker could use this to impersonate a previously paired Bluetooth device. (CVE-2020-10135)  It was discovered that the console keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25656)  Minh Yuan discovered that the tty driver in the Linux kernel contained race conditions when handling fonts. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25668)  Keyu Man discovered that the ICMP global rate limiter in the Linux kernel could be used to assist in scanning open UDP ports. A remote attacker could use to facilitate attacks on UDP based services that depend on source port randomization. (CVE-2020-25705)  Jinoh Kang discovered that the Xen event channel infrastructure in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. An attacker in guest could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (dom0 crash). (CVE-2020-27675)  Daniel Axtens discovered that PowerPC RTAS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict memory accesses in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to arbitrarily modify kernel memory, potentially bypassing kernel lockdown restrictions. (CVE-2020-27777)  Minh Yuan discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle fonts in some conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-28974)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-4680-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-image-4.15.0-1103-azure - 4.15.0-1103.114~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1103.78 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
