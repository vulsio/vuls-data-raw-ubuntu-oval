		"description": "USN-2710-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. The upstream fix for CVE-2015-5600 caused a regression resulting in random authentication failures in non-default configurations. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled usernames when  using PAM authentication. If an additional vulnerability were discovered in  the OpenSSH unprivileged child process, this issue could allow a remote  attacker to perform user impersonation. (CVE number pending)    Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled context memory  when using PAM authentication. If an additional vulnerability were  discovered in the OpenSSH unprivileged child process, this issue could  allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication or possibly execute  arbitrary code. (CVE number pending)    Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled time windows for  X connections. A remote attacker could use this issue to bypass certain  access restrictions. (CVE-2015-5352)    It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled keyboard-interactive  authentication. In a non-default configuration, a remote attacker could  possibly use this issue to perform a brute-force password attack.  (CVE-2015-5600)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2710-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  openssh-server-udeb - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 openssh-client - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 openssh-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 ssh-askpass-gnome - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 ssh - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 ssh-krb5 - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 openssh-client-udeb - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 openssh-sftp-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3 No subscription required",
