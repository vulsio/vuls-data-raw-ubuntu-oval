		"description": "Huzaifa Sidhpurwala, Hanno BÃ¶ck, and David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when decoding ASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2108)  Juraj Somorovsky discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed padding when the connection uses the AES CBC cipher and the server supports AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle attack and decrypt traffic. (CVE-2016-2107)  Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of input data to the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2105)  Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of input data to the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2106)  Brian Carpenter discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2109)  As a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to reject DH key sizes below 1024 bits, preventing a possible downgrade attack.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-2959-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19 No subscription required",
