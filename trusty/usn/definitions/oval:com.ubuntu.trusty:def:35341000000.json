		"description": "It was discovered that the GNU C library did not properly handle all of the possible return values from the kernel getcwd(2) syscall. A local attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code in setuid programs and gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2018-1000001)  A memory leak was discovered in the _dl_init_paths() function in the GNU C library dynamic loader. A local attacker could potentially exploit this with a specially crafted value in the LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable, in combination with CVE-2017-1000409 and another vulnerability on a system with hardlink protections disabled, in order to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-1000408)  A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the _dl_init_paths() function in the GNU C library dynamic loader. A local attacker could potentially exploit this with a specially crafted value in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, in combination with CVE-2017-1000408 and another vulnerability on a system with hardlink protections disabled, in order to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-1000409)  An off-by-one error leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the GNU C library glob() implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a maliciously crafted pattern. (CVE-2017-15670)  A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered during unescaping of user names with the ~ operator in the GNU C library glob() implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a maliciously crafted pattern. (CVE-2017-15804)  It was discovered that the GNU C library dynamic loader mishandles RPATH and RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN for privileged (setuid or AT_SECURE) programs. A local attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a specially crafted library in the current working directory in order to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-16997)  It was discovered that the GNU C library malloc() implementation could return a memory block that is too small if an attempt is made to allocate an object whose size is close to SIZE_MAX, resulting in a heap-based overflow. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10. (CVE-2017-17426)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3534-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libc6-i386 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-ppc64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libnss-dns-udeb - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc-bin - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-x32 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-prof - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-armel - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 eglibc-source - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-pic - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-dev-ppc64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-dev-armel - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libnss-files-udeb - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 glibc-doc - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 multiarch-support - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-dev - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-amd64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-dev-amd64 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-dev-x32 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-udeb - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc6-dev-i386 - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 libc-dev-bin - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 nscd - 2.19-0ubuntu6.14 No subscription required",
