		"description": "Jakub Å»oczek discovered that certain Fail2ban actions handled whois responses in an insecure way. If Fail2ban was configured to use certain mail actions like 'mail-whois' on a target system, a remote attacker who was able to control whois responses to this target system could possibly execute arbitrary code.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5232-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  fail2ban - 0.8.11-1ubuntu0.1~esm1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
