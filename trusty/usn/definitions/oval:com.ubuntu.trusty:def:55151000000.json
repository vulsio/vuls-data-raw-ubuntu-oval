		"description": "Eric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation in the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2021-4197)  Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1011)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the 6pack protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1198)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1199)  Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1204)  Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1205)  It was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-1353)  It was discovered that the implementation of X.25 network protocols in the Linux kernel did not terminate link layer sessions properly. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1516)  Zheyu Ma discovered that the Silicon Motion SM712 framebuffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle very small reads. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2380)  It was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28389)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5515-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  linux-headers-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-modules-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-azure-headers-4.15.0-1146 - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-azure-tools-4.15.0-1146 - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-tools-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-azure-cloud-tools-4.15.0-1146 - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-modules-extra-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-image-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 linux-buildinfo-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro  linux-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 linux-signed-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 linux-signed-image-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 linux-modules-extra-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 linux-image-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 linux-cloud-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 linux-headers-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 linux-tools-azure - 4.15.0.1146.115 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
