		"description": "An issue was discovered in the HTML parser in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-1235)  An issue was discovered in the Web Audio API implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-1236)  A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1237)  An out-of-bounds write was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1238)  An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the WebGL implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1240)  An issue was discovered with the interaction of page navigation and touch event handling. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct \"tap jacking\" attacks.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1242)  It was discovered that websocket connections were not upgraded whenever a HSTS policy is active. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. (CVE-2015-1244)  An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1246)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1249)  A use-after-free was discovered in the file picker implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1321)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
