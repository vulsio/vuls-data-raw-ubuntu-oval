		"description": "It was discovered that klibc did not properly perform some mathematical operations, leading to an integer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-31870)  It was discovered that klibc did not properly handled some memory allocations on 64 bit systems. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-31871)  It was discovered that klibc did not properly handled some file sizes values on 32 bit systems. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-31872)  It was discovered that klibc did not properly handled some memory allocations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-31873)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-5379-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  klibc-utils - 2.0.3-0ubuntu1.14.04.3+esm2 libklibc - 2.0.3-0ubuntu1.14.04.3+esm2 libklibc-dev - 2.0.3-0ubuntu1.14.04.3+esm2 Available with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
