		"description": "It was discovered that DBus incorrectly validated the source of ActivationFailure signals. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-0245)  It was discovered that DBus incorrectly handled certain format strings. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue is only exposed to unprivileged users when the fix for CVE-2015-0245 is not applied, hence this issue is only likely to affect Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10 have been updated as a preventative measure in the event that a new attack vector for this issue is discovered. (No CVE number)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3116-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  dbus - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4 dbus-x11 - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4 libdbus-1-3 - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4 libdbus-1-dev - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4 dbus-1-doc - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4 No subscription required",
