A local attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing attack and recover private ECDSA keys. (CVE-2018-0495)  It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain v2-compatible ClientHello messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a replay attack. (CVE-2018-12384)  It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain padding oracles. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a variant of the Bleichenbacher attack.
