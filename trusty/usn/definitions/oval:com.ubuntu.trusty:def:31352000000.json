		"description": "USN-3135-1 fixed a vulnerability in GStreamer Good Plugins. The original security fix was incomplete. This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Chris Evans discovered that GStreamer Good Plugins did not correctly handle  malformed FLC movie files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted  FLC movie file with a GStreamer application, an attacker could cause a  denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the  privileges of the user invoking the program.  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3135-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  gstreamer0.10-plugins-good - 0.10.31-3+nmu1ubuntu5.2 gstreamer0.10-plugins-good-doc - 0.10.31-3+nmu1ubuntu5.2 gstreamer0.10-gconf - 0.10.31-3+nmu1ubuntu5.2 gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio - 0.10.31-3+nmu1ubuntu5.2 No subscription required  gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio - 1.2.4-1~ubuntu1.3 gstreamer1.0-plugins-good-doc - 1.2.4-1~ubuntu1.3 libgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-dev - 1.2.4-1~ubuntu1.3 libgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-0 - 1.2.4-1~ubuntu1.3 gstreamer1.0-plugins-good - 1.2.4-1~ubuntu1.3 No subscription required",
