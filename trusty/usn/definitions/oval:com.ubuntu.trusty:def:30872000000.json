		"description": "USN-3087-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The fix for CVE-2016-2182 was incomplete and caused a regression when parsing certificates. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request  extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory  consumption, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6304)    Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when  performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this  issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This  issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update.  (CVE-2016-2177)    CÃ©sar Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL  did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing.  A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing  attack and recover private DSA keys. (CVE-2016-2178)    Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime  of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could  possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of  service. (CVE-2016-2179)    Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the  TS_OBJ_print_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this  issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2180)    It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay  feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial  of service. (CVE-2016-2181)    Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A  remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2016-2182)    Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES  ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could  possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted  sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM.  (CVE-2016-2183)    Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths.  A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2016-6302)    Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the  MDC2_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6303)    Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message  length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a  denial of service. (CVE-2016-6306)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3087-2` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21 libssl-dev - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21 openssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21 libssl-doc - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21 libcrypto1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21 libssl1.0.0-udeb - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.21 No subscription required",
