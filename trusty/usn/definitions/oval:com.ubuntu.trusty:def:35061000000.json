(CVE-2017-17433)  It was discovered that rsync does not check for fnamecmp filenames and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames. An attacker could use this to bypass access restrictions. (CVE-2017-17434)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo pro fix USN-3506-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  rsync - 3.1.0-2ubuntu0.3 No subscription required",
