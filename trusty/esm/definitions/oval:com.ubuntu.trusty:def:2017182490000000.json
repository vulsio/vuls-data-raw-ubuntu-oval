    "Title": "CVE-2017-18249 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The add_free_nid function in fs/f2fs/node.c in the Linux kernel before 4.12 does not properly track an allocated nid, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (race condition) or possibly have unspecified other impact via concurrent threads. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-18249` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1040-aws - 4.4.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
