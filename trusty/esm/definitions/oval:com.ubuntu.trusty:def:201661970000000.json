    "Title": "CVE-2016-6197 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "fs/overlayfs/dir.c in the OverlayFS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.6 does not properly verify the upper dentry before proceeding with unlink and rename system-call processing, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a rename system call that specifies a self-hardlink. It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-6197` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-generic - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-lowlatency - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-36-generic - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-generic - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-lowlatency - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-36-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-36-generic - 4.4.0-36.55~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
