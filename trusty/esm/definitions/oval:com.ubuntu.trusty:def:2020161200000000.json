		"Title": "CVE-2020-16120 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying up files in an overlayfs and could be exploited from within a user namespace, if, for example, unprivileged user namespaces were allowed. It was possible to have a file not readable by an unprivileged user to be copied to a mountpoint controlled by the user, like a removable device. This was introduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef (\"ovl: stack file ops\"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by commits 56230d9 (\"ovl: verify permissions in ovl_path_open()\"), 48bd024 (\"ovl: switch to mounter creds in readdir\") and 05acefb (\"ovl: check permission to open real file\"). Additionally, commits 130fdbc (\"ovl: pass correct flags for opening real directory\") and 292f902 (\"ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()\") in kernel 5.8 might also be desired or necessary. These additional commits introduced a regression in overlay mounts within user namespaces which prevented access to files with ownership outside of the user namespace. This regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da (\"ovl: do not fail because of O_NOATIMEi\") in kernel 5.11. Giuseppe Scrivano discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass intended restrictions and gain read access to restricted files.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-16120` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-azure - 4.15.0-1098.109~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1098-azure - 4.15.0-1098.109~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
