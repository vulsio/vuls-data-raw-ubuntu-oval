		"description": "In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61 and BC-FJA before 1.0.1.2,attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private exponent becauseof Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs. This occurs inorg.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding. Sending invalid ciphertextthat decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP Decoder could result in thethrowing of an early exception, potentially leaking some information aboutthe private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption.",
