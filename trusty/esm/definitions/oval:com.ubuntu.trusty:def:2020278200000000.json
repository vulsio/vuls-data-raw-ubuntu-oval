		"Title": "CVE-2020-27820 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel, where a use-after-frees in nouveau's postclose() handler could happen if removing device (that is not common to remove video card physically without power-off, but same happens if \"unbind\" the driver). Jeremy Cline discovered a use-after-free in the nouveau graphics driver of the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged or physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-27820` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1104-aws - 4.4.0-1104.109\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-224-generic - 4.4.0-224.257~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-224-generic - 4.4.0-224.257~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-224-lowlatency - 4.4.0-224.257~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-224-generic - 4.4.0-224.257~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-224-generic - 4.4.0-224.257~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-224-lowlatency - 4.4.0-224.257~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
