    "Title": "CVE-2021-42008 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The decode_data function in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.13 has a slab out-of-bounds write. Input from a process that has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can lead to root access. It was discovered that the 6pack network protocol driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform validation checks. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-42008` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1125-azure - 4.15.0-1125.138~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1125-azure - 4.15.0-1125.138~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
