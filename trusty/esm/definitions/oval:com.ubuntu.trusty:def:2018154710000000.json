		"Title": "CVE-2018-15471 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - high",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in xenvif_set_hash_mapping indrivers/net/xen-netback/hash.c in the Linux kernel through 4.18.1, as usedin Xen through 4.11.x and other products. The Linux netback driver allowsfrontends to control mapping of requests to request queues. When processinga request to set or change this mapping, some input validation (e.g., foran integer overflow) was missing or flawed, leading to OOB access in hashhandling. A malicious or buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged)backend to make out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in oneor more of privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), or informationleaks.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-15471` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1031-azure - 4.15.0-1031.32~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
