    "Title": "CVE-2019-16089 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.2.13. nbd_genl_status in drivers/block/nbd.c does not check the nla_nest_start_noflag return value. It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for error conditions in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-16089` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1091-azure - 4.15.0-1091.101~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
