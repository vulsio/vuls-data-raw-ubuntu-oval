		"Title": "CVE-2017-7277 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The TCP stack in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6 mishandles the SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS feature, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel's internal socket data structures or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted system calls, related to net/core/skbuff.c and net/socket.c. JongHwan Kim discovered an out-of-bounds read in the TCP stack of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or leak sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-7277` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
