    "Title": "CVE-2019-1999 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In binder_alloc_free_page of binder_alloc.c, there is a possible double free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: Android kernel. Android ID: A-120025196. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Binder IPC driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
