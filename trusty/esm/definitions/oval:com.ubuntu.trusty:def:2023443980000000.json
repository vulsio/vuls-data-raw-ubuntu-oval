		"Description": "Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, deleteand modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds writewas found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function,`BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier versions ofExiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds write is triggered when Exiv2is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker couldpotentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they cantrick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. This bug isfixed in version v0.28.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no knownworkarounds for this vulnerability.",
