    "Title": "CVE-2014-6278 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-6278` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbash - 4.3-7ubuntu1.5\nbash-builtins - 4.3-7ubuntu1.5\nbash-static - 4.3-7ubuntu1.5\nNo subscription required",
