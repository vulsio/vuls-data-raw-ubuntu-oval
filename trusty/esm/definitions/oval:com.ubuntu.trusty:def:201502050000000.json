    "Title": "CVE-2015-0205 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The ssl3_get_cert_verify function in s3_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k accepts client authentication with a Diffie-Hellman (DH) certificate without requiring a CertificateVerify message, which allows remote attackers to obtain access without knowledge of a private key via crafted TLS Handshake Protocol traffic to a server that recognizes a Certification Authority with DH support.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-0205` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8\nopenssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8\nNo subscription required",
