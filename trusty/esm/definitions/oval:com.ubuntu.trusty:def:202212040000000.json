    "Title": "CVE-2022-1204 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Amateur Radio AX.25 protocol functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1204` to fix the vulnerability.
