This is related to missing filename validation in thewp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must havecapabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to theAuthor, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is todelete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increasethe attacker's privileges.",
