    "Title": "CVE-2016-6130 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Race condition in the sclp_ctl_ioctl_sccb function in drivers/s390/char/sclp_ctl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by changing a certain length value, aka a \"double fetch\" vulnerability. Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the s390 SCLP console driver for the Linux kernel when handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-6130` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
