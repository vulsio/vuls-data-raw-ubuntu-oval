    "Title": "CVE-2022-41218 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41218` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1117-aws - 4.4.0-1117.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-lowlatency - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-lowlatency - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
