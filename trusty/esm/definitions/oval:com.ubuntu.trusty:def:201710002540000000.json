		"Title": "CVE-2017-1000254 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. Whenlibcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous ornot), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command.The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, insidedouble quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl forsubsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directoryname, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quotewould lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holdingthe name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could readbeyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyondthe buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server couldabuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work withit - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and themistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that thishas issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformedPWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploitof this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit[415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005.In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string butalso rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000254` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.11\nlibcurl3 - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.11\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.11\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.11\nNo subscription required",
