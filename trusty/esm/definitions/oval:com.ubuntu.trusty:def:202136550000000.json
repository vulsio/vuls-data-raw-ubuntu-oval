    "Title": "CVE-2021-3655 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. Ilja Van Sprundel discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform size validations on incoming packets in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3655` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1126-azure - 4.15.0-1126.139~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
