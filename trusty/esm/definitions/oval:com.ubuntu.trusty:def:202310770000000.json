    "Title": "CVE-2023-1077 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry, not detected by the BUG_ON condition, as the confused entry will not be NULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a type confused entry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused sched_rt_entity,causing memory corruption. It was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
