		"Title": "CVE-2023-42445 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support formulti-language development. In some cases, when Gradle parses XML files,resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with an Out OfBand XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration oflocal text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML files for severalpurposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or werealready present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files canbe fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all usecases to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse toparse XML files that have XML external entities.",
