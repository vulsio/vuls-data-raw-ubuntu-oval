		"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2.Since the page allocator does not yield CPU resources to the owner of theoom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user can trivially lock up the systemforever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator (e.g., viaconcurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE:the software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in partbecause of a viewpoint that \"the underlying problem is non-trivial tohandle.\"",
