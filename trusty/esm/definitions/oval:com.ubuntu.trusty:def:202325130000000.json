		"Title": "CVE-2023-2513 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem in the way it handled the extra inode size for extended attributes. This flaw could allow a privileged local user to cause a system crash or other undefined behaviors. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle extra inode size for extended attributes, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-2513` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
