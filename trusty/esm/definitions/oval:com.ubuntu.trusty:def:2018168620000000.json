		"Title": "CVE-2018-16862 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in a way that the cleancache subsystem clears an inode after the final file truncation (removal). The new file created with the same inode may contain leftover pages from cleancache and the old file data instead of the new one. Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-16862` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1038-aws - 4.4.0-1038.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-lowlatency - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-lowlatency - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
