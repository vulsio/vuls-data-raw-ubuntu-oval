    "Title": "CVE-2019-19071 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the rsi_send_beacon() function in drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi_91x_mgmt.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering rsi_prepare_beacon() failures, aka CID-d563131ef23c. It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19071` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-azure - 4.15.0-1071.76~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-azure - 4.15.0-1071.76~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
