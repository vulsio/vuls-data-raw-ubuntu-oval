		"Title": "CVE-2019-10126 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A heap based buffer overflow in mwifiex_uap_parse_tail_ies function in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/ie.c might lead to memory corruption and possibly other consequences. It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-10126` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1054-aws - 4.4.0-1054.58\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
