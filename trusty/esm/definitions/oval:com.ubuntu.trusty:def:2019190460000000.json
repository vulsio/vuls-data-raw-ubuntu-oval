    "Title": "CVE-2019-19046 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the __ipmi_bmc_register() function in drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering ida_simple_get() failure, aka CID-4aa7afb0ee20. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because an attacker cannot realistically control this failure at probe time. It was discovered that the IPMI message handler implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19046` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1074-azure - 4.15.0-1074.79~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1074-azure - 4.15.0-1074.79~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
