		"Title": "CVE-2021-38208 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "net/nfc/llcp_sock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.10 allows local unprivileged users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and BUG) by making a getsockname call after a certain type of failure of a bind call. It was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle failed connect events leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-38208` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1102-aws - 4.4.0-1102.107\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-azure - 4.15.0-1122.135~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1122-azure - 4.15.0-1122.135~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
