    "Title": "CVE-2013-4350 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The IPv6 SCTP implementation in net/sctp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel through 3.11.1 uses data structures and function calls that do not trigger an intended configuration of IPsec encryption, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network. Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2013-4350` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.12.0-1-generic - 3.12.0-1.3\nlinux-image-3.12.0-1-generic-lpae - 3.12.0-1.3\nlinux-image-extra-3.12.0-1-generic - 3.12.0-1.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.12.0-1-generic - 3.12.0-1.3\nlinux-image-3.12.0-1-generic-lpae - 3.12.0-1.3\nlinux-image-extra-3.12.0-1-generic - 3.12.0-1.3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
