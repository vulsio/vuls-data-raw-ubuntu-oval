    "Title": "CVE-2023-31084 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(&fepriv->sem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(&fepriv->sem) may block the process. It was discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking events in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-31084` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1122-aws - 4.4.0-1122.128\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1169-azure - 4.15.0-1169.184~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-244-generic - 4.4.0-244.278~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-244-generic - 4.4.0-244.278~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-244-lowlatency - 4.4.0-244.278~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1169-azure - 4.15.0-1169.184~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-244-generic - 4.4.0-244.278~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-244-generic - 4.4.0-244.278~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-244-lowlatency - 4.4.0-244.278~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
