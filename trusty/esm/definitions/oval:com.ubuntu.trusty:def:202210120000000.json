    "Title": "CVE-2022-1012 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A memory leak problem was found in the TCP source port generation algorithm in net/ipv4/tcp.c due to the small table perturb size. This flaw may allow an attacker to information leak and may cause a denial of service problem. Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1012` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
