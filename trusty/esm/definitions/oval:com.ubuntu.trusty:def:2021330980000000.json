    "Title": "CVE-2021-33098 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. Asaf Modelevsky discovered that the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate large MTU requests from Virtual Function (VF) devices. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-33098` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1102-aws - 4.4.0-1102.107\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
