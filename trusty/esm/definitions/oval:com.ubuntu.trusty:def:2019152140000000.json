		"Title": "CVE-2019-15214 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10. There is a use-after-free in the sound subsystem because card disconnection causes certain data structures to be deleted too early. This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a potential use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
