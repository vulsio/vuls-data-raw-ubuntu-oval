    "Title": "CVE-2014-7191 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The qs module before 1.0.0 in Node.js does not call the compact function for array data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by using a large index value to create a sparse array. It was discovered that the qs module in Node.js incorrectly handled inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-7191` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-qs - 0.6.5-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
