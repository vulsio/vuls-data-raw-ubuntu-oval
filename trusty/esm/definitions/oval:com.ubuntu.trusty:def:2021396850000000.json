		"Title": "CVE-2021-39685 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In various setup methods of the USB gadget subsystem, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect flag check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-210292376References: Upstream kernel Szymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain gadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-39685` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1109-aws - 4.4.0-1109.115\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-lowlatency - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-lowlatency - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
