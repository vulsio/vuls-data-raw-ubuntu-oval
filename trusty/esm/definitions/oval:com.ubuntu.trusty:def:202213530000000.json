    "Title": "CVE-2022-1353 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. It was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1353` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1109-aws - 4.4.0-1109.115\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-lowlatency - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-generic - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-229-lowlatency - 4.4.0-229.263~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
