    "Title": "CVE-2018-5382 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people need to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type \"BKS-V1\" was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of \"BKS-V1\" is discouraged by the library authors and should only be used where it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going to cause a security issue in itself.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-5382` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibbcmail-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nlibbcpg-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nlibbcpkix-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nlibbcprov-java - 1.49+dfsg-2\nNo subscription required",
