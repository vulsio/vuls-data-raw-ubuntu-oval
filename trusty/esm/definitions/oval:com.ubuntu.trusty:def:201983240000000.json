		"Title": "CVE-2019-8324 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by code in ensure_loadable_spec during the preinstall check. It was discovered that RubyGems as embedded in JRuby did not properly handle multi-line gem names. If a user were tricked into installing a malicious gem, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-8324` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njruby - 1.5.6-9+deb8u2build0.14.04.1~esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlibruby1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nlibtcltk-ruby1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nri1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.1 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.1-examples - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.1-full - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nruby1.9.3 - 1.9.3.484-2ubuntu1.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlibruby2.0 - 2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.13\nruby2.0 - 2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.13\nruby2.0-tcltk - 2.0.0.484-1ubuntu2.13\nNo subscription required",
