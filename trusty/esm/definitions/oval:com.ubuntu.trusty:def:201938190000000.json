    "Title": "CVE-2019-3819 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hid_debug_events_read() in drivers/hid/hid-debug.c file which may enter an infinite loop with certain parameters passed from a userspace. A local privileged user (\"root\") can cause a system lock up and a denial of service. Versions from v4.18 and newer are vulnerable. Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3819` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1040-aws - 4.4.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
