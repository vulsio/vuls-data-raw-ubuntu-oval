    "Title": "CVE-2019-18808 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the ccp_run_sha_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-128c66429247. It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-18808` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-azure - 4.15.0-1096.106~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-azure - 4.15.0-1096.106~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
