It was discovered that Bottle improperly handles headers. An attacker could possibly exploit this as a CRLF attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-9964` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-bottle - 0.12.0-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\npython3-bottle - 0.12.0-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
