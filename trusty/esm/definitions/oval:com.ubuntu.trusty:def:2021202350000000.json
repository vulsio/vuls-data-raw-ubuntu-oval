		"Title": "CVE-2021-20235 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "There's a flaw in the zeromq server in versions before 4.3.3 in src/decoder_allocators.hpp. The decoder static allocator could have its sized changed, but the buffer would remain the same as it is a static buffer. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-20235` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibzmq3 - 4.0.4+dfsg-2ubuntu0.1+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
