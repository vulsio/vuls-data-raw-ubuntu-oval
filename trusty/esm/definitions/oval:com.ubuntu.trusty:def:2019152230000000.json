		"Title": "CVE-2019-15223 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.1.8. There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/driver.c driver. It was discovered that the Line 6 USB driver for the Linux kernel contained a race condition when the device was disconnected. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
