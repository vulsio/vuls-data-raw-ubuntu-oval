		"Description": "GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package thatprovides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and softwareauditing. In GLPI before version 9.5.4 there is an Insecure Direct ObjectReference (IDOR) on \"Solutions\". This vulnerability gives an unauthorizeduser the ability to enumerate GLPI items names (including users logins)using the knowbase search form (requires authentication). To Reproduce:Perform a valid authentication at your GLPI instance, Browse the ticketlist and select any open ticket, click on Solution form, then Search asolution form that will redirect you to the endpoint/\"glpi/front/knowbaseitem.php?item_itemtype=Ticket&item_items_id=18&forcetab=Knowbase$1\",and the item_itemtype=Ticket parameter present in the previous URL willpoint to the PHP alias of glpi_tickets table, so just replace it with\"Users\" to point to glpi_users table instead; in the same way,item_items_id=18 will point to the related column id, so changing it tooyou should be able to enumerate all the content which has an alias. Sincesuch id(s) are obviously incremental, a malicious party could exploit thevulnerability simply by guessing-based attempts.",
