		"Title": "CVE-2018-1120 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found affecting the Linux kernel before version 4.17. By mmap()ing a FUSE-backed file onto a process's memory containing command line arguments (or environment strings), an attacker can cause utilities from psutils or procps (such as ps, w) or any other program which makes a read() call to the /proc/<pid>/cmdline (or /proc/<pid>/environ) files to block indefinitely (denial of service) or for some controlled time (as a synchronization primitive for other attacks). It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report operating system state, such as ps(1).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-1120` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1039-aws - 4.4.0-1039.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
