		"description": "TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting(mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s core undo/redofunctionality and other APIs and plugins. Text nodes within specificparents are not escaped upon serialization according to the HTML standard.If such text nodes contain a special character reserved as an internalmarker, they can be combined with other HTML patterns to form malicioussnippets. These snippets pass the initial sanitisation layer when thecontent is parsed into the editor body, but can trigger XSS when thespecial internal marker is removed from the content and re-parsed. hisvulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9. Usersare advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for thisvulnerability.",
