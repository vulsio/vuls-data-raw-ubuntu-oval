		"description": "SimpleSAMLphp versions before 1.18.6 contain an information disclosurevulnerability. The module controller in `SimpleSAML\\Module` that processesrequests for pages hosted by modules, has code to identify paths endingwith `.php` and process those as PHP code. If no other suitable way ofhandling the given path exists it presents the file to the browser. Thecheck to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for uppercaseletters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the serveris serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as onWindows, the processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source codeis instead presented to the browser. An attacker may use this issue to gainaccess to the source code in third-party modules that is meant to beprivate, or even sensitive. However, the attack surface is consideredsmall, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp serves such contentfrom a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on Windows. Thisissue is fixed in version 1.18.6.",
