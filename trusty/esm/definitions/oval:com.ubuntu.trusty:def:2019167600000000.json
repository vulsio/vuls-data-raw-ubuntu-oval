		"title": "CVE-2019-16760 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency if yourpackage.toml file uses the `package` configuration key. Usage of the`package` key to rename dependencies in `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust1.25.0 and prior. When Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo may download thewrong dependency, which could be squatted on crates.io to be a maliciouspackage. This not only affects manifests that you write locally yourself,but also manifests published to crates.io. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0is affected by this advisory because Cargo will ignore the `package` key inmanifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not affected and typicallywill emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0 andafter are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Usersof the affected versions are strongly encouraged to update their compilerto the latest available one. Preventing this issue from happening requiresupdating your compiler to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer. There will be nopoint release for Rust versions prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 toRust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches to mitigate the issue.",
