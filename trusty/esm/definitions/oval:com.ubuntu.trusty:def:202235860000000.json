    "Title": "CVE-2022-3586 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service. Gwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3586` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1118-aws - 4.4.0-1118.124\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1158-azure - 4.15.0-1158.173~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-240-generic - 4.4.0-240.274~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-240-generic - 4.4.0-240.274~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-240-lowlatency - 4.4.0-240.274~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1158-azure - 4.15.0-1158.173~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-240-generic - 4.4.0-240.274~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-240-generic - 4.4.0-240.274~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-240-lowlatency - 4.4.0-240.274~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
