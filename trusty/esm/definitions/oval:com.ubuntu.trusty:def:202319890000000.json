    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in btsdio_remove in drivers\\bluetooth\\btsdio.c in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw, a call to btsdio_remove with an unfinished job, may cause a race problem leading to a UAF on hdev devices. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth HCI SDIO driver, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
