    "Title": "CVE-2022-1462 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s TeleTYpe subsystem. The issue occurs in how a user triggers a race condition using ioctls TIOCSPTLCK and TIOCGPTPEER and TIOCSTI and TCXONC with leakage of memory in the flush_to_ldisc function. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or read unauthorized random data from memory. It was discovered that the tty subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1462` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1117-aws - 4.4.0-1117.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-lowlatency - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-lowlatency - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
