		"Description": "A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum-export.c. An attackerwho submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could triggerundefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type`unsigned long long` as well as a shift exponent that is too large for64-bit type. This would most likely lead to an impact to applicationavailability, but could potentially cause other problems related toundefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to7.0.9-0.",
