		"Title": "CVE-2023-1513 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in KVM. When calling the KVM_GET_DEBUGREGS ioctl, on 32-bit systems, there might be some uninitialized portions of the kvm_debugregs structure that could be copied to userspace, causing an information leak. Xingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1513` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1165-azure - 4.15.0-1165.180~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1165-azure - 4.15.0-1165.180~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
