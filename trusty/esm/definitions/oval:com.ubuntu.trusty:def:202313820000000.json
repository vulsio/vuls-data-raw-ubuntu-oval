    "Title": "CVE-2023-1382 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A data race flaw was found in the Linux kernel, between where con is allocated and con->sock is set. This issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing con->sock->sk in net/tipc/topsrv.c in the tipc protocol in the Linux kernel. Wei Chen discovered that a race condition existed in the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
