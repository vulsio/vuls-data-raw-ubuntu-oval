		"Title": "CVE-2018-2790 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u181, 7u171, 8u162 and 10; Java SE Embedded: 8u161. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N). It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not correctly perform merging of multiple sections for the same file listed in JAR archive file manifests. An attacker could possibly use this to modify attributes in a manifest without invalidating the signature.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-2790` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nicedtea-7-jre-jamvm - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-demo - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-jdk - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-jre - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-jre-headless - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-jre-lib - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-jre-zero - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-source - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nopenjdk-7-tests - 7u181-2.6.14-0ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
