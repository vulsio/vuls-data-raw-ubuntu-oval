		"Title": "CVE-2016-9777 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "KVM in the Linux kernel before 4.8.12, when I/O APIC is enabled, does not properly restrict the VCPU index, which allows guest OS users to gain host OS privileges or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and host OS crash) via a crafted interrupt request, related to arch/x86/kvm/ioapic.c and arch/x86/kvm/ioapic.h. Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict the VCPU index when I/O APIC is enabled, An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges in the host OS.",
