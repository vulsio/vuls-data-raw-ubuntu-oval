    "Note": "mdeslaur> this issue only affects the Cache Manager, which is usually restricted to trusted clients only. The patch is intrusive to backport to 3.x versions, so we will not be fixing this issue in older releases. We recommend setting appropriate access control to limit connections from trusted clients."
