    "Title": "CVE-2019-19044 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "Two memory leaks in the v3d_submit_cl_ioctl() function in drivers/gpu/drm/v3d/v3d_gem.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering kcalloc() or v3d_job_init() failures, aka CID-29cd13cfd762. It was discovered that the Broadcom V3D DRI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
