    "Title": "CVE-2021-20322 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well. Keyu Man discovered that the ICMP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle received ICMP error packets. A remote attacker could use this to facilitate attacks on UDP based services that depend on source port randomization.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-20322` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-azure - 4.15.0-1130.143~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-azure - 4.15.0-1130.143~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
