    "Title": "CVE-2023-3268 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out of bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel in relay_file_read_start_pos in kernel/relay.c in the relayfs. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information. It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform certain buffer calculations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3268` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
