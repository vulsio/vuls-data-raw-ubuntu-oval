		"Title": "CVE-2019-19070 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the spi_gpio_probe() function in drivers/spi/spi-gpio.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering devm_add_action_or_reset() failures, aka CID-d3b0ffa1d75d. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because the system must have already been out of memory before the probe began.",
