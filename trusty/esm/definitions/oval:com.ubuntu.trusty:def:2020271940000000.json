		"Title": "CVE-2020-27194 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.8.15. scalar32_min_max_or in kernel/bpf/verifier.c mishandles bounds tracking during use of 64-bit values, aka CID-5b9fbeb75b6a. Simon Scannell discovered that the bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate register bounds for certain operations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or gain administrative privileges.",
