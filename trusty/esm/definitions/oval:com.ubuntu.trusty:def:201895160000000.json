    "Title": "CVE-2018-9516 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "In hid_debug_events_read of drivers/hid/hid-debug.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A-71361580. It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly gain additional privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-9516` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1028-aws - 4.4.0-1028.31\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-generic - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-lowlatency - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-134-generic - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-generic - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-lowlatency - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-134-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-134-generic - 4.4.0-134.160~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
