		"Title": "CVE-2018-18584 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In mspack/cab.h in libmspack before 0.8alpha and cabextract before 1.8, the CAB block input buffer is one byte too small for the maximal Quantum block, leading to an out-of-bounds write. It was discovered that cabextract incorrectly handled certain malformed CAB files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause cabextract to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18584` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncabextract - 1.4-4ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nclamav - 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.14.04.2\nclamav-base - 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.14.04.2\nclamav-daemon - 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.14.04.2\nclamav-freshclam - 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.14.04.2\nclamav-milter - 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.14.04.2\nclamav-testfiles - 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.14.04.2\nlibclamav7 - 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlibmspack0 - 0.4-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
