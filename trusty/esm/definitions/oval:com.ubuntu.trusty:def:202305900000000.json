		"Title": "CVE-2023-0590 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux Kernel due to a race problem. This flaw leads to a denial of service issue. If patch ebda44da44f6 (\"net: sched: fix race condition in qdisc_graft()\") not applied yet, then kernel could be affected. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the qdisc implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
