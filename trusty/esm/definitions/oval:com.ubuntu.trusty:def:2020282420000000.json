		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.37.1, 16.xbefore 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x before 18.0.1 and CertifiedAsterisk before 16.8-cert5. If Asterisk is challenged on an outbound INVITEand the nonce is changed in each response, Asterisk will continually sendINVITEs in a loop. This causes Asterisk to consume more and more memorysince the transaction will never terminate (even if the call is hung up),ultimately leading to a restart or shutdown of Asterisk. Outboundauthentication must be configured on the endpoint for this to occur.",
