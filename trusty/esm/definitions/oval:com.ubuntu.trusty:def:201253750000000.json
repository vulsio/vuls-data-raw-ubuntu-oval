		"Title": "CVE-2012-5375 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "The CRC32C feature in the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.8-rc1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (prevention of file creation) by leveraging the ability to write to a directory important to the victim, and creating a file with a crafted name that is associated with a specific CRC32C hash value. A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash value in a directory important to the victim.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2012-5375` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
