		"Title": "CVE-2022-26966 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12. drivers/net/usb/sr9700.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from heap memory via crafted frame lengths from a device. It was discovered that the USB SR9700 ethernet device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate the length of requests from the device. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-26966` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
