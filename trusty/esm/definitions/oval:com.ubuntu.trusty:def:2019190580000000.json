		"Title": "CVE-2019-19058 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A memory leak in the alloc_sgtable() function in drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/fw/dbg.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering alloc_page() failures, aka CID-b4b814fec1a5. It was discovered that the Intel(R) Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19058` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1074-azure - 4.15.0-1074.79~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1074-azure - 4.15.0-1074.79~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
