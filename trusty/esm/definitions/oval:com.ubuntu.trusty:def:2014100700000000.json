    "Title": "CVE-2014-10070 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "zsh before 5.0.7 allows evaluation of the initial values of integer variables imported from the environment (instead of treating them as literal numbers). That could allow local privilege escalation, under some specific and atypical conditions where zsh is being invoked in privilege-elevation contexts when the environment has not been properly sanitized, such as when zsh is invoked by sudo on systems where \"env_reset\" has been disabled.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2014-10070` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nzsh - 5.0.2-3ubuntu6.1\nzsh-beta - 5.0.2-3ubuntu6.1\nzsh-common - 5.0.2-3ubuntu6.1\nzsh-static - 5.0.2-3ubuntu6.1\nNo subscription required",
