    "Title": "CVE-2018-20784 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 4.20.2, kernel/sched/fair.c mishandles leaf cfs_rq's, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop in update_blocked_averages) or possibly have unspecified other impact by inducing a high load. Zhipeng Xie discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered in the CFS Linux kernel process scheduler. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-20784` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1059-aws - 4.4.0-1059.63\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-generic - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-lowlatency - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-170-generic - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-170-lowlatency - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-generic - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-lowlatency - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-170-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-170-generic - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-170-lowlatency - 4.4.0-170.199~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
