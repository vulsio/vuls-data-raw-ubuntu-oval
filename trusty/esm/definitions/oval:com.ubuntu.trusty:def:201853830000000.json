    "Title": "CVE-2018-5383 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Bluetooth firmware or operating system software drivers in macOS versions before 10.13, High Sierra and iOS versions before 11.4, and Android versions before the 2018-06-05 patch may not sufficiently validate elliptic curve parameters used to generate public keys during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which may allow a remote attacker to obtain the encryption key used by the device. Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-5383` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1054-aws - 4.4.0-1054.58\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
