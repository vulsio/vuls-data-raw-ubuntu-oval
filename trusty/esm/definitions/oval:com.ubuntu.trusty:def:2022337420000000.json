    "Title": "CVE-2022-33742 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742). It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux kernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain backends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33742` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
