    "Title": "CVE-2019-15292 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.9. There is a use-after-free in atalk_proc_exit, related to net/appletalk/atalk_proc.c, net/appletalk/ddp.c, and net/appletalk/sysctl_net_atalk.c. It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AppleTalk implementation in the Linux kernel if an error occurs during initialization. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
