    "Title": "CVE-2020-26147 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation could reassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate selected fragments.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26147` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
