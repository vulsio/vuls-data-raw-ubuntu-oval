Two consecutive ioctls cantrigger the bug: the first one should set the drive geometry with .sect and.rate values that make F_SECT_PER_TRACK be zero. Next, the floppy formatoperation should be called. It can be triggered by an unprivileged localuser even when a floppy disk has not been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates thefloppy device by default.",
