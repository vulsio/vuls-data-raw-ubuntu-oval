    "Title": "CVE-2022-41858 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A NULL pointer dereference may occur while a slip driver is in progress to detach in sl_tx_timeout in drivers/net/slip/slip.c. This issue could allow an attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information. Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the SLIP driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41858` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1116-aws - 4.4.0-1116.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-lowlatency - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-lowlatency - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
