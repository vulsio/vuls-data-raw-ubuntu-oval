		"Title": "CVE-2019-18609 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in amqp_handle_input in amqp_connection.c in rabbitmq-c 0.9.0. There is an integer overflow that leads to heap memory corruption in the handling of CONNECTION_STATE_HEADER. A rogue server could return a malicious frame header that leads to a smaller target_size value than needed. This condition is then carried on to a memcpy function that copies too much data into a heap buffer.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-18609` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\namqp-tools - 0.4.1-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nlibrabbitmq1 - 0.4.1-1ubuntu0.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
