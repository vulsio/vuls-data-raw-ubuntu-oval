		"Title": "CVE-2018-13095 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_inode_buf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (memory corruption and BUG) can occur for a corrupted xfs image upon encountering an inode that is in extent format, but has more extents than fit in the inode fork. Wen Xu discovered that the xfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the number of extents in an inode. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-13095` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1090-aws - 4.4.0-1090.94\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-azure - 4.15.0-1112.124~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1112-azure - 4.15.0-1112.124~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
