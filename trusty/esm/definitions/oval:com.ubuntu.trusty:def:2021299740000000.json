    "Title": "CVE-2021-29974 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 90.",
