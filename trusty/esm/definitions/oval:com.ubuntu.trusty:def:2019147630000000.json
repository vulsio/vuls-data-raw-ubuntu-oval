    "Title": "CVE-2019-14763 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 4.16.4, a double-locking error in drivers/usb/dwc3/gadget.c may potentially cause a deadlock with f_hid. Tuba Yavuz discovered that a race condition existed in the DesignWare USB3 DRD Controller device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
