    "Title": "CVE-2022-23960 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information. Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by ARM to their processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23960` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1142-azure - 4.15.0-1142.156~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
