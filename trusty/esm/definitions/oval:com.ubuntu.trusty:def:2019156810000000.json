    "Title": "CVE-2019-15681 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "LibVNC commit before d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a contains a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which allow an attacker to read stack memory and can be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity. These vulnerabilities have been fixed in commit d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a. Pavel Cheremushkin discovered that TightVNC has a memory leak vulnerability. An attacker could use it to disclosure sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-15681` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ntightvncserver - 1.3.9-6.5+deb8u1build0.14.04.1~esm1\nxtightvncviewer - 1.3.9-6.5+deb8u1build0.14.04.1~esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
