		"Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 3.4.7 and 4.x before 4.1.1. There is an out of bounds read/write in the function HaarEvaluator::OptFeature::calc in modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp, which leads to denial of service. It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain files. An attaacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",

		"Note": "ccdm94> the commit that fixes this issue is the same as the one for CVE-2019-14491. See: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/15150. In xenial and earlier, it is necessary to backport the fix for this CVE. However, changes in the code that have occurred since the release of versions available in xenial and earlier cause this backport to be quite intrusive. To backport and properly apply the patch, it would be necessary to alter library functions that are exported, meaning that it would be necessary to alter their interfaces, which could end up causing regressions in software that uses the opencv library to operate. It also seems like a backported version of the patch does not completely fix the vulnerability, with the POC file causing a similar crash, even after the fix is applied."
