		"description": "marked is an application that is meant to parse and compile markdown. Dueto the way that marked 0.3.5 and earlier parses input, specifically HTMLentities, it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection(`sanitize: true`) to inject a `javascript:` URL. This flaw exists because`&#xNNanything;` gets parsed to what it could and leaves the rest behind,resulting in just `anything;` being left.",
