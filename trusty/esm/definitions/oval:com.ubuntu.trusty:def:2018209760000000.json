    "Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_super.c in the Linux kernel before 4.18. A use after free exists, related to xfs_fs_fill_super failure. It was discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mount failures in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
