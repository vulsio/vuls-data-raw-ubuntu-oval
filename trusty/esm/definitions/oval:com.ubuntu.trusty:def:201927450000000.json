		"Title": "CVE-2019-2745 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u221, 8u212 and 11.0.3. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Java SE executes to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). Keegan Ryan discovered that the ECC implementation in OpenJDK was not sufficiently resilient to side-channel attacks. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
