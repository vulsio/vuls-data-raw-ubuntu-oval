    "Title": "CVE-2020-26555 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Bluetooth legacy BR/EDR PIN code pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 1.0B through 5.2 may permit an unauthenticated nearby device to spoof the BD_ADDR of the peer device to complete pairing without knowledge of the PIN. It was discovered that the BR/EDR pin-code pairing procedure in the Linux kernel was vulnerable to an impersonation attack. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to pair to a device without knowledge of the pin-code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26555` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
