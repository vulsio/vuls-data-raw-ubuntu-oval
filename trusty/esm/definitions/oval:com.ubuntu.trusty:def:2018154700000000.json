		"Title": "CVE-2018-15470 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The logic in oxenstored forhandling writes depended on the order of evaluation of expressions makingup a tuple. As indicated in section 7.7.3 \"Operations on data structures\"of the OCaml manual, the order of evaluation of subexpressions is notspecified. In practice, different implementations behave differently. Thus,oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity. This allows amalicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries as it wishes,causing unbounded memory usage in oxenstored. This can lead to asystem-wide DoS.",
