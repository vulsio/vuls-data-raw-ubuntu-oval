		"description": "Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests.Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In theevent a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor`will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This canlead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.This has been fixed inRails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and 5.2.6.1. Upgrading is highlyrecommended, but to work around this problem a middleware described inGHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 can be used.",
