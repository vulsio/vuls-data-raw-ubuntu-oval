		"Title": "CVE-2019-17546 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10, as used in GDAL through 3.0.1 and other products, has an integer overflow that potentially causes a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted RGBA image, related to a \"Negative-size-param\" condition. It was discovered that GDAL incorrectly handled certain malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-17546` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngdal-bin - 1.10.1+dfsg-5ubuntu1+esm1\nlibgdal-java - 1.10.1+dfsg-5ubuntu1+esm1\nlibgdal-perl - 1.10.1+dfsg-5ubuntu1+esm1\nlibgdal1h - 1.10.1+dfsg-5ubuntu1+esm1\npython-gdal - 1.10.1+dfsg-5ubuntu1+esm1\npython3-gdal - 1.10.1+dfsg-5ubuntu1+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlibtiff-opengl - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm6\nlibtiff-tools - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm6\nlibtiff5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm6\nlibtiffxx5 - 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.11+esm6\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
