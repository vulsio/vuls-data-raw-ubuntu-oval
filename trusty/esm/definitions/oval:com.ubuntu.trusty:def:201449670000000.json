		"Description": "Multiple argument injection vulnerabilities in Ansible before 1.6.7 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging access to an Ansible managed host and providing a crafted fact, as demonstrated by a fact with (1) a trailing \" src=\" clause, (2) a trailing \" temp=\" clause, or (3) a trailing \" validate=\" clause accompanied by a shell command. It was discovered that Ansible mishandled certain input.
