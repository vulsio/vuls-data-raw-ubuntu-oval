		"Title": "CVE-2018-7740 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The resv_map_release function in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG) via a crafted application that makes mmap system calls and has a large pgoff argument to the remap_file_pages system call. It was discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in the hugetlbfs implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-7740` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1039-aws - 4.4.0-1039.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
