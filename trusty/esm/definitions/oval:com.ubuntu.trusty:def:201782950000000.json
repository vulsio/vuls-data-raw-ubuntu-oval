		"title": "CVE-2017-8295 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-resete-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to resetarbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpasswordrequest and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leadingto transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlledSMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variablein wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function.Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at leastone of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim fromreceiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing theoriginal message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containingthe original message.",
