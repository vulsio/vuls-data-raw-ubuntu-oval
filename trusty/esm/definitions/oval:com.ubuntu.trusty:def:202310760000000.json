		"Title": "CVE-2023-1076 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters. It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1076` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
