		"Title": "CVE-2019-19076 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the nfp_abm_u32_knode_replace() function in drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/abm/cls.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-78beef629fd9. NOTE: This has been argued as not a valid vulnerability. The upstream commit 78beef629fd9 was reverted. It was discovered that there was a memory leak in the Advanced Buffer Management functionality of the Netronome NFP4000/NFP6000 NIC Driver in the Linux kernel during certain error scenarios. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
