		"Title": "CVE-2019-13233 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In arch/x86/lib/insn-eval.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.9, there is a use-after-free for access to an LDT entry because of a race condition between modify_ldt() and a #BR exception for an MPX bounds violation. Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
