    "Title": "CVE-2018-20836 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.20. There is a race condition in smp_task_timedout() and smp_task_done() in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c, leading to a use-after-free. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
