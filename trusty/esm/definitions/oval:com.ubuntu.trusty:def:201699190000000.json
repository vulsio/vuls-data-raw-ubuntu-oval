		"Title": "CVE-2016-9919 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The icmp6_send function in net/ipv6/icmp.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.12 omits a certain check of the dst data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a fragmented IPv6 packet. Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ipv6 icmp implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check data structures on send. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
