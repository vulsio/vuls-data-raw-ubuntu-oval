		"Title": "CVE-2017-7979 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The cookie feature in the packet action API implementation in net/sched/act_api.c in the Linux kernel 4.11.x through 4.11-rc7 mishandles the tb nlattr array, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and refcount underflow, and system hang or crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via \"tc filter add\" commands in certain contexts. NOTE: this does not affect stable kernels, such as 4.10.x, from kernel.org. Fabian Grünbichler discovered that the Packet action API implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled uninitialized data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-7979` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
