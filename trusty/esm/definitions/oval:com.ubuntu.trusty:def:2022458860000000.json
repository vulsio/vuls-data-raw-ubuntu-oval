		"Title": "CVE-2022-45886 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c has a .disconnect versus dvb_device_open race condition that leads to a use-after-free. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
