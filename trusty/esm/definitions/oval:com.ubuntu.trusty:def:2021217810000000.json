    "Title": "CVE-2021-21781 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the ARM SIGPAGE functionality of Linux Kernel v5.4.66 and v5.4.54. The latest version (5.11-rc4) seems to still be vulnerable. A userland application can read the contents of the sigpage, which can leak kernel memory contents. An attacker can read a processâ€™s memory at a specific offset to trigger this vulnerability. This was fixed in kernel releases: 4.14.222 4.19.177 5.4.99 5.10.17 5.11\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21781` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-azure - 4.15.0-1114.127~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1114-azure - 4.15.0-1114.127~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
