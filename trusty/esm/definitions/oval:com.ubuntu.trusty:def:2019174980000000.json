		"Title": "CVE-2019-17498 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server. It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled bound checks in SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-17498` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssh2-1 - 1.4.3-2ubuntu0.2+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
