    "Title": "CVE-2019-19067 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Four memory leaks in the acp_hw_init() function in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acp.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.8 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering mfd_add_hotplug_devices() or pm_genpd_add_device() failures, aka CID-57be09c6e874. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because the attacker must already have privileges for module loading. It was discovered that the AMD Audio Coprocessor driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker with the ability to load modules could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-19067` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-azure - 4.15.0-1096.106~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1096-azure - 4.15.0-1096.106~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
