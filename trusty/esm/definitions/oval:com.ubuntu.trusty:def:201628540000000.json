    "Title": "CVE-2016-2854 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The aufs module for the Linux kernel 3.x and 4.x does not properly maintain POSIX ACL xattr data, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging a group-writable setgid directory. It was discovered that the aufs file system in the Linux kernel did not properly maintain POSIX ACL xattr data, when mounted with the non-default allow_userns option. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-2854` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1102-aws - 4.4.0-1102.107\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-generic - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-222-lowlatency - 4.4.0-222.255~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
