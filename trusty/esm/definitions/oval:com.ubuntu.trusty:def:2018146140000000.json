    "Title": "CVE-2018-14614 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an out-of-bounds access in __remove_dirty_segment() in fs/f2fs/segment.c when mounting an f2fs image. Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-14614` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1040-aws - 4.4.0-1040.43\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-144-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-generic - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-144-lowlatency - 4.4.0-144.170~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
