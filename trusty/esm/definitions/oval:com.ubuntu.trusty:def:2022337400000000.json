    "Title": "CVE-2022-33740 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742). Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33740` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1112-aws - 4.4.0-1112.118\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-233-generic - 4.4.0-233.267~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-233-generic - 4.4.0-233.267~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-233-lowlatency - 4.4.0-233.267~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1153-azure - 4.15.0-1153.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-233-generic - 4.4.0-233.267~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-233-generic - 4.4.0-233.267~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-233-lowlatency - 4.4.0-233.267~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
