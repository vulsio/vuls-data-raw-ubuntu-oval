		"title": "CVE-2020-10543 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low",
		"description": "Perl before 5.30.3 on 32-bit platforms allows a heap-based buffer overflowbecause nested regular expression quantifiers have an integer overflow. An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this usage scenario. Additionally, the target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the overflow occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64bit systems.]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-10543` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibcgi-fast-perl - 5.18.2-2ubuntu1.7+esm3\nlibperl5.18 - 5.18.2-2ubuntu1.7+esm3\nperl - 5.18.2-2ubuntu1.7+esm3\nperl-base - 5.18.2-2ubuntu1.7+esm3\nperl-debug - 5.18.2-2ubuntu1.7+esm3\nperl-modules - 5.18.2-2ubuntu1.7+esm3\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
