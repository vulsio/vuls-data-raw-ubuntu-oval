		"Title": "CVE-2013-4592 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Memory leak in the __kvm_set_memory_region function in virt/kvm/kvm_main.c in the Linux kernel before 3.9 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by leveraging certain device access to trigger movement of memory slots. A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine (KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2013-4592` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
