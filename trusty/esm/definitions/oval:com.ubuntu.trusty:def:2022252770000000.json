		"description": "Drupal core sanitizes filenames with dangerous extensions upon upload(reference: SA-CORE-2020-012) and strips leading and trailing dots fromfilenames to prevent uploading server configuration files (reference:SA-CORE-2019-010). However, the protections for these two vulnerabilitiespreviously did not work correctly together. As a result, if the site wereconfigured to allow the upload of files with an htaccess extension, thesefiles' filenames would not be properly sanitized. This could allowbypassing the protections provided by Drupal core's default .htaccess filesand possible remote code execution on Apache web servers. This issue ismitigated by the fact that it requires a field administrator to explicitlyconfigure a file field to allow htaccess as an extension (a restrictedpermission), or a contributed module or custom code that overrides allowedfile uploads.",
