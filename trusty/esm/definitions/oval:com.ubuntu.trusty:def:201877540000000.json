    "Title": "CVE-2018-7754 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "The aoedisk_debugfs_show function in drivers/block/aoe/aoeblk.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.4rc4 allows local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading \"ffree: \" lines in a debugfs file. It was discovered that the debugfs implementation in the linux kernel could expose kernel addresses. A privileged attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-7754` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
