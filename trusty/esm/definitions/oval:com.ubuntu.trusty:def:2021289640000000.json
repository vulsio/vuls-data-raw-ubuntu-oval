		"Title": "CVE-2021-28964 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A race condition was discovered in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG) because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation, aka CID-dbcc7d57bffc. Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28964` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
