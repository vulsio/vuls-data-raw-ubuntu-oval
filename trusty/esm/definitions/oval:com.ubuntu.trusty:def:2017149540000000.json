		"Title": "CVE-2017-14954 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "The waitid implementation in kernel/exit.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.4 accesses rusage data structures in unintended cases, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism, via a crafted system call. Alexander Potapenko discovered an information leak in the waitid implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-14954` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
