    "Title": "CVE-2022-1184 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernelâ€™s filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service. It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1184` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1120-aws - 4.4.0-1120.126\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-lowlatency - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-lowlatency - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
