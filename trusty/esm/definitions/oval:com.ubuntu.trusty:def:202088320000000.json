		"Title": "CVE-2020-8832 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The fix for the Linux kernel in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for CVE-2019-14615 (\"The Linux kernel did not properly clear data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors.\") was discovered to be incomplete, meaning that in versions of the kernel before 4.15.0-91.92, an attacker could use this vulnerability to expose sensitive information. Gregory Herrero discovered that the fix for CVE-2019-14615 to address the Linux kernel not properly clearing data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors was incomplete. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-8832` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1074-azure - 4.15.0-1074.79~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1074-azure - 4.15.0-1074.79~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
