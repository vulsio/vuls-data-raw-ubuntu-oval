		"Title": "CVE-2019-5489 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13 allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information. (Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server.",

		"Note": "tyhicks> On 2018-01-06, a potential fix for this issue was committed in the upstream kernel git tree. The potential fix changes the behavior of the mincore(2) system call in ways that could possibly break userspace applications. The potential fix landed during the kernel's \"merge window\" which allows for the change to mature and receive additional testing. Applying the potential fix to Ubuntu kernels, at this time, could potentially break some existing applications. Ubuntu will continue to monitor related changes in the upstream kernel and evaluate/test the potential fix. sbeattie> v1 fix was reverted. v2 of fix is now 134fca9063ad4851de767d1768180e5dede9a881"
