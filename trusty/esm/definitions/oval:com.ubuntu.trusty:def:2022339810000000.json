    "Title": "CVE-2022-33981 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function. Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-33981` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
