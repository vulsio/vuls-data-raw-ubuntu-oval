    "Title": "CVE-2022-40768 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "drivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case. Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX storage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-40768` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1157-azure - 4.15.0-1157.172~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
