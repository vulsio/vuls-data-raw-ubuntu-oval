    "Title": "CVE-2023-4385 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing sanity check. It was discovered that the JFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate memory allocations in certain situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious JFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4385` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1123-aws - 4.4.0-1123.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-azure - 4.15.0-1150.165~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-lowlatency - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1150-azure - 4.15.0-1150.165~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-lowlatency - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
