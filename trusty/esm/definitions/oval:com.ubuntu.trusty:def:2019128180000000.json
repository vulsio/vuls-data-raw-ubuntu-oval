    "Title": "CVE-2019-12818 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.20.15. The nfc_llcp_build_tlv function in net/nfc/llcp_commands.c may return NULL. If the caller does not check for this, it will trigger a NULL pointer dereference. This will cause denial of service. This affects nfc_llcp_build_gb in net/nfc/llcp_core.c. It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilty existed in the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
