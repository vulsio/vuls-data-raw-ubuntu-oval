		"Title": "CVE-2023-42754 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel ipv4 stack. The socket buffer (skb) was assumed to be associated with a device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the case if the skb is re-routed by ipvs. This issue may allow a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to crash the system. Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in certain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-42754` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
