		"Title": "CVE-2018-10883 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bounds write in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata(), a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image. Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-10883` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1038-aws - 4.4.0-1038.41\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-lowlatency - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-lowlatency - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-142-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-142-generic - 4.4.0-142.168~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
