		"title": "CVE-2021-23841 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts tocreate a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number datacontained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handleany errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occurif the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequentlyresult in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial ofservice attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is neverdirectly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable ifthey use this function directly and they use it on certificates that mayhave been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i andbelow are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade toOpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by thisissue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receivingpublic updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgradeto 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j(Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-23841` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27+esm2\nopenssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.27+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
