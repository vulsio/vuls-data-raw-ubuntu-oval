    "Title": "CVE-2020-12656 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** gss_mech_free in net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c in the rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10 lacks certain domain_release calls, leading to a memory leak. Note: This was disputed with the assertion that the issue does not grant any access not already available. It is a problem that on unloading a specific kernel module some memory is leaked, but loading kernel modules is a privileged operation. A user could also write a kernel module to consume any amount of memory they like and load that replicating the effect of this bug. It was discovered that the Kerberos SUNRPC GSS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory on module unload. A local privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-12656` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-azure - 4.15.0-1093.103~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1093-azure - 4.15.0-1093.103~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
