		"Title": "CVE-2016-7039 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - high.",
		"Description": "The IP stack in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for large crafted packets, as demonstrated by packets that contain only VLAN headers, a related issue to CVE-2016-8666. Vladimír Beneš discovered an unbounded recursion in the VLAN and TEB Generic Receive Offload (GRO) processing implementations in the Linux kernel, A remote attacker could use this to cause a stack corruption, leading to a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-7039` to fix the vulnerability.
