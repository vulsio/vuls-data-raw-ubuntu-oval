    "Title": "CVE-2023-32269 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.1.11. In net/netrom/af_netrom.c, there is a use-after-free because accept is also allowed for a successfully connected AF_NETROM socket. However, in order for an attacker to exploit this, the system must have netrom routing configured or the attacker must have the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. It was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-32269` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1123-aws - 4.4.0-1123.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1165-azure - 4.15.0-1165.180~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-lowlatency - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1165-azure - 4.15.0-1165.180~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-lowlatency - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
