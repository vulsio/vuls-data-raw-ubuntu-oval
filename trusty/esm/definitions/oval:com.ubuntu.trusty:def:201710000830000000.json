		"Title": "CVE-2017-1000083 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "backend/comics/comics-document.c (aka the comic book backend) in GNOME Evince before 3.24.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a .cbt file that is a TAR archive containing a filename beginning with a \"--\" command-line option substring, as demonstrated by a --checkpoint-action=exec=bash at the beginning of the filename. Felix Wilhelm discovered that Evince did not safely invoke tar when handling tar comic book (cbt) files. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious comic book format file that, when opened in Evince, executes arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000083` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nevince - 3.10.3-0ubuntu10.3\nevince-common - 3.10.3-0ubuntu10.3\nevince-gtk - 3.10.3-0ubuntu10.3\ngir1.2-evince-3.0 - 3.10.3-0ubuntu10.3\nlibevdocument3-4 - 3.10.3-0ubuntu10.3\nlibevview3-3 - 3.10.3-0ubuntu10.3\nNo subscription required",
