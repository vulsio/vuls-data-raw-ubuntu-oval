		"description": "The actionpack ruby gem before 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible openredirect vulnerability. Specially crafted Host headers in combination withcertain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middlewarein Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. This is similar toCVE-2021-22881. Strings in config.hosts that do not have a leading dot areconverted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This causes, forexample, `config.hosts << \"sub.example.com\"` to permit a request with aHost header value of `sub-example.com`.",
