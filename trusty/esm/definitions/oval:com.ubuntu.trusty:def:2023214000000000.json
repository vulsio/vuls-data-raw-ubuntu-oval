    "Title": "CVE-2023-21400 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - high.",
    "Description": "In multiple functions of io_uring.c, there is a possible kernel memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Ye Zhang and Nicolas Wu discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking for rings with IOPOLL, leading to a double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
