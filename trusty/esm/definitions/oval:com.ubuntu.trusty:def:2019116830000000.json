		"Title": "CVE-2019-11683 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "udp_gro_receive_segment in net/ipv4/udp_offload.c in the Linux kernel 5.x before 5.0.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (slab-out-of-bounds memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via UDP packets with a 0 payload, because of mishandling of padded packets, aka the \"GRO packet of death\" issue. It was discovered that the IPv4 generic receive offload (GRO) for UDP implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle padded packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-11683` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
