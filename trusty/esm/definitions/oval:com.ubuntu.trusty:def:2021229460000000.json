		"Title": "CVE-2021-22946 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-22946` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm8\nlibcurl3 - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm8\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm8\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm8\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
