    "Title": "CVE-2021-45095 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount leak. It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-45095` to fix the vulnerability.
