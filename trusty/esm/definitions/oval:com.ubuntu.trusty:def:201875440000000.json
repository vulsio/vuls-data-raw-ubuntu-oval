		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** A cross-protocol scripting issue was discovered in themanagement interface in OpenVPN through 2.4.5. When this interface isenabled over TCP without a password, and when no other clients areconnected to this interface, attackers can execute arbitrary managementcommands, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service(SIGTERM) by triggering XMLHttpRequest actions in a web browser. This isdemonstrated by a multipart/form-data POST to http://localhost:23000 with a\"signal SIGTERM\" command in a TEXTAREA element. NOTE: The vendor disputesthat this is a vulnerability. They state that this is the result ofimproper configuration of the OpenVPN instance rather than an intrinsicvulnerability, and now more explicitly warn against such configurations inboth the management-interface documentation, and with a runtime warning.",
