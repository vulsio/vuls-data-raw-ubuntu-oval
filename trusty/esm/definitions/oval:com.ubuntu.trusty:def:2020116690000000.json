		"Title": "CVE-2020-11669 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2 on the powerpc platform. arch/powerpc/kernel/idle_book3s.S does not have save/restore functionality for PNV_POWERSAVE_AMR, PNV_POWERSAVE_UAMOR, and PNV_POWERSAVE_AMOR, aka CID-53a712bae5dd. David Gibson discovered that the Linux kernel on Power9 CPUs did not properly save and restore Authority Mask registers state in some situations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host system crash).",
