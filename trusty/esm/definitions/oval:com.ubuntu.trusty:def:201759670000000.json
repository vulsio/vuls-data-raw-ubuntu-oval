		"Title": "CVE-2017-5967 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "The time subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.9.9, when CONFIG_TIMER_STATS is enabled, allows local users to discover real PID values (as distinguished from PID values inside a PID namespace) by reading the /proc/timer_list file, related to the print_timer function in kernel/time/timer_list.c and the __timer_stats_timer_set_start_info function in kernel/time/timer.c. It was discovered that the timer stats implementation in the Linux kernel allowed the discovery of a real PID value while inside a PID namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5967` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1090-aws - 4.4.0-1090.94\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-208-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-generic - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-208-lowlatency - 4.4.0-208.240~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
