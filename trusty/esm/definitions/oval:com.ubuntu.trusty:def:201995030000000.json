		"Title": "CVE-2019-9503 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "The Broadcom brcmfmac WiFi driver prior to commita4176ec356c73a46c07c181c6d04039fafa34a9f is vulnerable to a framevalidation bypass. If the brcmfmac driver receives a firmware event framefrom a remote source, the is_wlc_event_frame function will cause this frameto be discarded and unprocessed. If the driver receives the firmware eventframe from the host, the appropriate handler is called. This framevalidation can be bypassed if the bus used is USB (for instance by a wifidongle). This can allow firmware event frames from a remote source to beprocessed. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFipackets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to executearbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerabilitywill result in denial-of-service conditions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9503` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1059-azure - 4.15.0-1045.49~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
