		"Title": "CVE-2017-1000376 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note that libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000376` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibffi6 - 3.1~rc1+r3.0.13-12ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
