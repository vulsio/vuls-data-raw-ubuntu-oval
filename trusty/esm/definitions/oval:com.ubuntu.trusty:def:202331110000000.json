		"Title": "CVE-2023-3111 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use after free vulnerability was found in prepare_to_relocate in fs/btrfs/relocation.c in btrfs in the Linux Kernel. This possible flaw can be triggered by calling btrfs_ioctl_balance() before calling btrfs_ioctl_defrag(). It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3111` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1120-aws - 4.4.0-1120.126\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-lowlatency - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-generic - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-242-lowlatency - 4.4.0-242.276~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
