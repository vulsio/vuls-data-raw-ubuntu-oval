		"description": "** DISPUTED ** DCTStream::getChars in DCTStream.cc in Poppler 20.12.1 has aheap-based buffer overflow via a crafted PDF document. NOTE: later reportsindicate that this only affects builds from Poppler git clones in lateDecember 2020, not the 20.12.1 release. In this situation, it should NOT beconsidered a Poppler vulnerability. However, several third-party OpenSource projects directly rely on Poppler git clones made at arbitrarytimes, and therefore the CVE remains useful to users of those projects.",
