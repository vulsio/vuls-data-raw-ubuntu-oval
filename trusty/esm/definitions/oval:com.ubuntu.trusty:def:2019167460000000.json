    "Description": "An issue was discovered in net/wireless/nl80211.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.17. It does not check the length of variable elements in a beacon head, leading to a buffer overflow. It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi configuration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
