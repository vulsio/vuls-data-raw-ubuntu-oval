		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. The PCI passthrough codeimproperly uses register data. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling have beenidentified that act on unsanitized values read back from device hardwareregisters. While devices strictly compliant with PCI specificationsshouldn't be able to affect these registers, experience shows that it'svery common for devices to have out-of-spec \"backdoor\" operations that canaffect the result of these reads. A not fully trusted guest may be able tocrash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system.Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versionsof Xen supporting PCI passthrough are affected. Only x86 systems arevulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only guests with passed throughPCI devices may be able to leverage the vulnerability. Only systems passingthrough devices with out-of-spec (\"backdoor\") functionality can causeissues. Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality is common;unless you have reason to believe that your device does not have suchfunctionality, it's better to assume that it does.",
