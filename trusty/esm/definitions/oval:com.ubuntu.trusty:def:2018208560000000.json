    "Title": "CVE-2018-20856 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.18.7. In block/blk-core.c, there is an __blk_drain_queue() use-after-free because a certain error case is mishandled. It was discovered that a use-after-free error existed in the block layer subsystem of the Linux kernel when certain failure conditions occurred. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-20856` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
