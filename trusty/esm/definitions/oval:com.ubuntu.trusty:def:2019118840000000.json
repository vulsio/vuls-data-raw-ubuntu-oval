		"Title": "CVE-2019-11884 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The do_hidp_sock_ioctl function in net/bluetooth/hidp/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.15 allows a local user to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a HIDPCONNADD command, because a name field may not end with a '\\0' character. It was discovered that the Bluetooth Human Interface Device Protocol (HIDP) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify strings were NULL terminated in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
