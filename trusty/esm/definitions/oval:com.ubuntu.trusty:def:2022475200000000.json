    "Title": "CVE-2022-47520 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing offset validation in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/hif.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds read when parsing a Robust Security Network (RSN) information element from a Netlink packet. It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-47520` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
