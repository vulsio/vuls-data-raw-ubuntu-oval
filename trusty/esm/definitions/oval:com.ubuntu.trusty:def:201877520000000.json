    "Description": "GPAC through 0.7.1 has a Buffer Overflow in the gf_media_avc_read_sps function in media_tools/av_parsers.c, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-1000100. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngpac - 0.5.0+svn4288~dfsg1-4ubuntu1+esm1\ngpac-modules-base - 0.5.0+svn4288~dfsg1-4ubuntu1+esm1\nlibgpac2 - 0.5.0+svn4288~dfsg1-4ubuntu1+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
