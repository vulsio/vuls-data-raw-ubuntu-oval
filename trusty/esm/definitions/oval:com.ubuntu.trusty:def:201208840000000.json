    "Title": "CVE-2012-0884 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The implementation of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and PKCS #7 in OpenSSL before 0.9.8u and 1.x before 1.0.0h does not properly restrict certain oracle behavior, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to decrypt data via a Million Message Attack (MMA) adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2012-0884` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1-4ubuntu1\nopenssl - 1.0.1-4ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nlibssl0.9.8 - 0.9.8o-7ubuntu3.2.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
