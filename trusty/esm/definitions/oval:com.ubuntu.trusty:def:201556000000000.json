    "Title": "CVE-2015-5600 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-5600` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nopenssh-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nssh - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nssh-krb5 - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nNo subscription required",
