		"Title": "CVE-2015-5600 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low",
		"Description": "The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactivedevices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remoteattackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPUconsumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh-oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client thatprovides a different password for each pam element on this list.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-5600` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nopenssh-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nssh - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nssh-krb5 - 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2\nNo subscription required",
