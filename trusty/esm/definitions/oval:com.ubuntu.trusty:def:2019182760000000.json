		"Title": "CVE-2019-18276 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equalto its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID toits real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systemsthat support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. Anattacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" forruntime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that callssetuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running withan effective UID of 0 are unaffected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-18276` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbash - 4.3-7ubuntu1.8+esm2\nbash-builtins - 4.3-7ubuntu1.8+esm2\nbash-static - 4.3-7ubuntu1.8+esm2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
