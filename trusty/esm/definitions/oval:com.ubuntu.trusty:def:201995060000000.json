    "Title": "CVE-2019-9506 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical brute-force attacks (aka \"KNOB\") that can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing. Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered that the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require sufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
