		"Title": "CVE-2023-1074 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service. It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1074` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1117-aws - 4.4.0-1117.123\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1163-azure - 4.15.0-1163.178~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-lowlatency - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1163-azure - 4.15.0-1163.178~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-generic - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-239-lowlatency - 4.4.0-239.273~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
