		"Title": "CVE-2017-2596 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "The nested_vmx_check_vmptr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.8 improperly emulates the VMXON instruction, which allows KVM L1 guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by leveraging the mishandling of page references. Dmitry Vyukov discovered that KVM implementation in the Linux kernel improperly emulated the VMXON instruction. A local attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) in the host OS.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-2596` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-lowlatency - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-lowlatency - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-79-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-79-generic - 4.4.0-79.100~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
