		"Title": "CVE-2023-30861 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of thefollowing conditions are met, a response containing data intended for oneclient may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients.If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's`session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on theapplication's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regardingcookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met. 1. Theapplication must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not stripcookies or ignore responses with cookies. 2. The application sets`session.permanent = True` 3. The application does not access or modify thesession at any point during a request. 4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`enabled (the default). 5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control`header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached. Thishappens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie`header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed(re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. Thisissue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.",
