    "Description": "Oracle MySQL before 5.7.3, Oracle MySQL Connector/C (aka libmysqlclient) before 6.1.3, and MariaDB before 5.5.44 use the --ssl option to mean that SSL is optional, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a cleartext-downgrade attack, aka a \"BACKRONYM\" attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2015-3152` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmariadbclient18 - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-client - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-client-5.5 - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-client-core-5.5 - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-common - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-server - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-server-5.5 - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-server-core-5.5 - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-test - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nmariadb-test-5.5 - 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
