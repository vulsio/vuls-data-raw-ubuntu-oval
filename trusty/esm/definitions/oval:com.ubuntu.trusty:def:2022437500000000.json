		"Title": "CVE-2022-43750 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory. It was discovered that the USB monitoring (usbmon) component in the Linux kernel did not properly set permissions on memory mapped in to user space processes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-43750` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1114-aws - 4.4.0-1114.120\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-generic - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-235-lowlatency - 4.4.0-235.269~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
