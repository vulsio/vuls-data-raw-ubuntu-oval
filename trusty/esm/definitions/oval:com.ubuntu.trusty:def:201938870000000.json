		"Title": "CVE-2019-3887 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the way KVM hypervisor handled x2APIC Machine Specific Rregister (MSR) access with nested(=1) virtualization enabled. In that, L1 guest could access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled. A guest could use this flaw to potentially crash the host kernel resulting in DoS issue. Kernel versions from 4.16 and newer are vulnerable to this issue. Marc Orr discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict APIC MSR register values when nested virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-3887` to fix the vulnerability.

		"Note": "tyhicks> Ubuntu kernels do not enable nested KVM virtualization by default and are unaffected by this flaw in the default configuration. However, installing QEMU results in nested KVM support to be enabled via the /etc/modprobe.d/qemu-system-x86.conf file. To ensure that nested virtualization is not enabled, verify that the /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested file contains \"N\"."
