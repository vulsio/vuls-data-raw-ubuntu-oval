		"Description": "It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the$XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable when calling the system xdg-open.OpenURL() in usersession/userd/launcher.go would alter $XDG_DATA_DIRS toappend a path to a directory controlled by the calling snap. A malicioussnap could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to controlhow the host system xdg-open script opens the URL and, for example, executea script shipped with the snap without confinement. This issue did notaffect Ubuntu Core systems. Fixed in snapd versions 2.45.1ubuntu0.2,2.45.1+18.04.2 and 2.45.1+20.04.2.",
