		"description": "An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that GRUBuses the UUID of a device to search for the configuration file thatcontains the password hash for the GRUB password protection feature. Anattacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a USB stickcontaining a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the \"/boot/\"file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection feature on UEFIsystems, which enumerate removable drives before non-removable ones. Thisissue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's version of grub2and does not affect the upstream package.",
