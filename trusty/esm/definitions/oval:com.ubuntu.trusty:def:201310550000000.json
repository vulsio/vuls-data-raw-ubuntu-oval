This could be achieved by adding an action to thelauncher and updating it with new callbacks until the libunity-webapps ratelimit was hit. Fixed in 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 ofunity-firefox-extension and in all versions of libunity-webapps by shippingan empty unity-firefox-extension package, thus disabling the extensionentirely and invalidating the attack against the libunity-webapps package.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2013-1055` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibufe-xidgetter0 - 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1\nxul-ext-unity - 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
