		"Title": "CVE-2017-1000371 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "The offset2lib patch as used by the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability,if RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte of memory isallocated (the maximum under the 1/4 restriction) then the stack will begrown down to 0x80000000, and as the PIE binary is mapped above 0x80000000the minimum distance between the end of the PIE binary's read-write segmentand the start of the stack becomes small enough that the stack guard pagecan be jumped over by an attacker. This affects Linux Kernel version4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 andCVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000371` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-93-generic - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-93-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-93-lowlatency - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-93-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-93-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-93-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-93-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-93-generic - 4.4.0-93.116~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
