    "Title": "CVE-2020-24588 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets. Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernelâ€™s WiFi implementation incorrectly handled certain malformed frames. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious server, a physically proximate attacker could use this issue to inject packets.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-24588` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
