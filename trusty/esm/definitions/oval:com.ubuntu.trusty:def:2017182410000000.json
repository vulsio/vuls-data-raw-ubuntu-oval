    "Title": "CVE-2017-18241 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "fs/f2fs/segment.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) by using a noflush_merge option that triggers a NULL value for a flush_cmd_control data structure. It was discovered that the f2fs filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle the noflush_merge mount option correctly. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-18241` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1039-aws - 4.4.0-1039.42\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-4.4.0-143-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-generic - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-143-lowlatency - 4.4.0-143.169~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
