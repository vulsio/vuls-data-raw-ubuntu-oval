		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OSusers to gain host OS privileges by leveraging race conditions in pagetablepromotion and demotion operations, because of an incomplete fix forCVE-2019-18421. XSA-299 addressed several critical issues in restartable PVtype change operations. Despite extensive testing and auditing, some cornercases were missed. A malicious PV guest administrator may be able toescalate their privilege to that of the host. All security-supportedversions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systemsare not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability. Note that theseattacks require very precise timing, which may be difficult to exploit inpractice.",
