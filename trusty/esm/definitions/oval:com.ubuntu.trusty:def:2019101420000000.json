    "Title": "CVE-2019-10142 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's freescale hypervisor manager implementation, kernel versions 5.0.x up to, excluding 5.0.17. A parameter passed to an ioctl was incorrectly validated and used in size calculations for the page size calculation. An attacker can use this flaw to crash the system, corrupt memory, or create other adverse security affects. It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Freescale (PowerPC) hypervisor manager in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with write access to /dev/fsl-hv could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
