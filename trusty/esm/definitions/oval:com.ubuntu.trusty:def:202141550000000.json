    "Title": "CVE-2021-4155 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them. Kirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4155` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1116-aws - 4.4.0-1116.122\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-lowlatency - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1131-azure - 4.15.0-1131.144~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-generic - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-237-lowlatency - 4.4.0-237.271~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
