    "Title": "CVE-2019-15218 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.1.8. There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver. It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash).",
