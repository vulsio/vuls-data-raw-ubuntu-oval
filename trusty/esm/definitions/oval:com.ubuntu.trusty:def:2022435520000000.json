The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14\nlibcurl3 - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.35.0-1ubuntu2.20+esm14\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
