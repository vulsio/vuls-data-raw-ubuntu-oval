    "Title": "CVE-2019-0136 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "Insufficient access control in the Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi Software driver before version 21.10 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via adjacent access. It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (Wi-Fi disconnect).",
