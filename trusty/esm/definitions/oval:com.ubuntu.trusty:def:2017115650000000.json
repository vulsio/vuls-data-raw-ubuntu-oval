    "Title": "CVE-2017-11565 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the apparmor package is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain the same forever), which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor restrictions by leveraging the silent loss of this protection mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init script). It was discovered that Tor incorrectly implemented AppArmor restrictions. An attacker could possibly bypass those restrictions and cause an unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-11565` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ntor - 0.2.4.27-1ubuntu0.1+esm1\ntor-geoipdb - 0.2.4.27-1ubuntu0.1+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
