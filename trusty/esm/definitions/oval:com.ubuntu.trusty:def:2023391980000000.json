		"description": "A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. Theqxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by theqxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holdinga reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returnedhandle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to adenial of service or privilege escalation.",
