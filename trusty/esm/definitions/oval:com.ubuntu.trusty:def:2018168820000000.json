		"Title": "CVE-2018-16882 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "A use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVMhypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization isenabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processingposted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used inpi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crashthe host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to asystem. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are vulnerable.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-16882` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nNo subscription required",
