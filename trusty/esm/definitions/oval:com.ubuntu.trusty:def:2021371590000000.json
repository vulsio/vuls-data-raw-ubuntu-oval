		"Title": "CVE-2021-37159 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free. It was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-37159` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1127-azure - 4.15.0-1127.140~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
