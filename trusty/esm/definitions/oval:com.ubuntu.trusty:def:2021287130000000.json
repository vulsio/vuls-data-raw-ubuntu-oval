		"description": "Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNAinformation record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains whichaspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the ability torun PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as\"driver domains\". Running PV backends in driver domains has one primarysecurity advantage: if a driver domain gets compromised, it doesn't havethe privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domaincould try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequencyleading to a Denial of Service in the guest due to trying to serviceinterrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affectedbackends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2,CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch 3, CVE-2021-28713\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-28713` to fix the vulnerability.
