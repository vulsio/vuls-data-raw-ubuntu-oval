    "Title": "CVE-2021-3679 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service. It was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3679` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1099-aws - 4.4.0-1099.104\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1124-azure - 4.15.0-1124.137~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-generic - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-219-lowlatency - 4.4.0-219.252~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
