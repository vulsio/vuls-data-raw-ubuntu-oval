    "Title": "CVE-2019-10207 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation of UART, all versions kernel 3.x.x before 4.18.0 and kernel 5.x.x. An attacker with local access and write permissions to the Bluetooth hardware could use this flaw to issue a specially crafted ioctl function call and cause the system to crash. It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
