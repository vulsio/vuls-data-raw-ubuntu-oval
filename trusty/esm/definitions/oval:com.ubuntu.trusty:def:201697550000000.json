    "Title": "CVE-2016-9755 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.9 mishandles IPv6 reassembly, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer overflow, out-of-bounds write, and GPF) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that makes socket, connect, and writev system calls, related to net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_conntrack_reasm.c and net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_defrag_ipv6_hooks.c. Dmitry Vyukov, Andrey Konovalov, Florian Westphal, and Eric Dumazet discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel mishandled IPv6 packet reassembly. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2016-9755` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
