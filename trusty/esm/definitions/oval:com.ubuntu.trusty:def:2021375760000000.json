    "Title": "CVE-2021-37576 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_rtas.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.5 on the powerpc platform allows KVM guest OS users to cause host OS memory corruption via rtas_args.nargs, aka CID-f62f3c20647e. Alexey Kardashevskiy discovered that the KVM implementation for PowerPC systems in the Linux kernel did not properly validate RTAS arguments in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
