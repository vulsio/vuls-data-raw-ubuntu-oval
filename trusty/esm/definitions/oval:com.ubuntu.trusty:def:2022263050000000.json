		"Title": "CVE-2022-26305 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existedwhere determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author was done byonly matching the serial number and issuer string of the used certificatewith that of a trusted certificate. This is not sufficient to verify thatthe macro was actually signed with the certificate. An adversary couldtherefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and anissuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice wouldpresent as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the userto execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. Thisissue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.",
