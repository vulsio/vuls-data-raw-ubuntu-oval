		"Title": "CVE-2023-4459 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in the networking sub-component in vmxnet3 in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with normal user privilege to cause a denial of service due to a missing sanity check during cleanup. It was discovered that the VMware VMXNET3 ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle errors in certain situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4459` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1123-aws - 4.4.0-1123.129\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-lowlatency - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1149-azure - 4.15.0-1149.164~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-generic - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-245-lowlatency - 4.4.0-245.279~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
