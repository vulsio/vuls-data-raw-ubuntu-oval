		"Title": "CVE-2020-25685 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply froma forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is theforwarded query that matches the reply, by only using a weak hash of thequery name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled withoutDNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an off-path attacker to findseveral different domains all having the same hash, substantially reducingthe number of attempts they would have to perform to forge a reply and getit accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifiesthat the query name is one of the attributes of a query that must be usedto match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS CachePoisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of asuccessful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability isto data integrity.",
