		"Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the kvm_ioctl_create_device function in virt/kvm/kvm_main.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.13 allows host OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly gain privileges via crafted ioctl calls on the /dev/kvm device. It was discovered that a use-after-free existed in the KVM susbsystem of the Linux kernel when creating devices. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
