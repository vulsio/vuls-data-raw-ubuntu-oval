		"Title": "CVE-2022-39253 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system.Versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3,and 2.37.4 are subject to exposure of sensitive information to a maliciousactor. When performing a local clone (where the source and target of theclone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's`$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creatinghardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks aredisabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victimto clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitiveinformation on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having thevictim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having themclone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodulefrom any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules`option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects`directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloninguntrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a sharedmachine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` orcloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoidcloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` orrun `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.",
