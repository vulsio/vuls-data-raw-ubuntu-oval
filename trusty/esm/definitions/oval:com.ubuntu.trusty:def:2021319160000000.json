    "Title": "CVE-2021-31916 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel before 5.12. A bound check failure allows an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-31916` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1115-azure - 4.15.0-1115.128~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
