		"Title": "CVE-2019-19059 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
		"Description": "Multiple memory leaks in the iwl_pcie_ctxt_info_gen3_init() function in drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/ctxt-info-gen3.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering iwl_pcie_init_fw_sec() or dma_alloc_coherent() failures, aka CID-0f4f199443fa. It was discovered that the Intel(R) Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
