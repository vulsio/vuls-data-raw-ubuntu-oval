    "Title": "CVE-2023-3141 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in r592_remove in drivers/memstick/host/r592.c in media access in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system at device disconnect, possibly leading to a kernel information leak. It was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3141` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1121-aws - 4.4.0-1121.127\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1168-azure - 4.15.0-1168.183~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-generic - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-243-lowlatency - 4.4.0-243.277~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
