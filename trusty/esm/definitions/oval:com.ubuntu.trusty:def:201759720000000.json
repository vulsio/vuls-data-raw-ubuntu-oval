    "Title": "CVE-2017-5972 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c attack code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-5972` to fix the vulnerability.
