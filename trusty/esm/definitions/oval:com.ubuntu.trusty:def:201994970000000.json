Thisvulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authenticationwithout knowing the password.

Both hostapd withSAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and includingversion 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support andwpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 areaffected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-9497` to fix the vulnerability.
