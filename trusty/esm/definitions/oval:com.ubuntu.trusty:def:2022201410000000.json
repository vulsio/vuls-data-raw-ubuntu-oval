    "Title": "CVE-2022-20141 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "In ip_check_mc_rcu of igmp.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege when opening and closing inet sockets with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-112551163References: Upstream kernel Liu Jian discovered that the IGMP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-20141` to fix the vulnerability.
