    "Title": "CVE-2019-18786 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.3.8, f->fmt.sdr.reserved is uninitialized in rcar_drif_g_fmt_sdr_cap in drivers/media/platform/rcar_drif.c, which could cause a memory disclosure problem. It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-18786` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-azure - 4.15.0-1071.76~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-azure - 4.15.0-1071.76~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
