		"Title": "CVE-2019-2101 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "In uvc_parse_standard_control of uvc_driver.c, there is a possible out-of-bound read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: Android kernel. Android ID: A-111760968. It was discovered that the USB video device class implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control bits, resulting in an out of bounds buffer read. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
