		"title": "CVE-2018-16873 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the \"go get\" command isvulnerable to remote code execution when executed with the -u flag and theimport path of a malicious Go package, or a package that imports itdirectly or indirectly. Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode,but not in module mode (the distinction is documented athttps://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). Using custom domains,it's possible to arrange things so that a Git repository is cloned to afolder named \".git\" by using a vanity import path that ends with \"/.git\".If the Git repository root contains a \"HEAD\" file, a \"config\" file, an\"objects\" directory, a \"refs\" directory, with some work to ensure theproper ordering of operations, \"go get -u\" can be tricked into consideringthe parent directory as a repository root, and running Git commands on it.That will use the \"config\" file in the original Git repository root for itsconfiguration, and if that config file contains malicious commands, theywill execute on the system running \"go get -u\".",
