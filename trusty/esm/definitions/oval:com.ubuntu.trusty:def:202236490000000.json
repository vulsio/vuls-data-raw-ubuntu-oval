    "Title": "CVE-2022-3649 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992. Khalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3649` to fix the vulnerability.
