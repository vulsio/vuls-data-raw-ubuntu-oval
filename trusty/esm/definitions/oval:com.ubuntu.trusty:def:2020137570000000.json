		"description": "Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\\0' bytes during decryption ofciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g.,by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or ifthe length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as bycausing excessive memory allocation).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-13757` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-rsa - 3.1.2-1ubuntu0.1+esm1\npython3-rsa - 3.1.2-1ubuntu0.1+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
