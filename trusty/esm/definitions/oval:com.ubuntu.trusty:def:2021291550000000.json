    "Title": "CVE-2021-29155 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.x. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. Specifically, for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations, the pointer modification performed by the first operation is not correctly accounted for when restricting subsequent operations. Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel performed out of bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-29155` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1121-azure - 4.15.0-1121.134~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
