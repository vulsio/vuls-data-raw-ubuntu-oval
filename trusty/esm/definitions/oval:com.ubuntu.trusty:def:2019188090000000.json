    "Title": "CVE-2019-18809 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - low.",
    "Description": "A memory leak in the af9005_identify_state() function in drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/af9005.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-2289adbfa559. It was discovered that the Afatech AF9005 DVB-T USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-18809` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-azure - 4.15.0-1071.76~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1071-azure - 4.15.0-1071.76~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
