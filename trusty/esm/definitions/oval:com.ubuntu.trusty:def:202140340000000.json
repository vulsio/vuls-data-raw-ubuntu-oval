		"Description": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexecutility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allowunprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefinedpolicies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the callingparameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variablesas commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environmentvariables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. Whensuccessfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalationgiven unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-4034` to fix the vulnerability.
