		"Description": "The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of serviceattack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragmentre-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sendingspecially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentationhave been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability(CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase ofthe IP fragment reassembly queue size.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-5391` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-3.13.0-173-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-generic - 3.13.0-155.205\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-173-lowlatency - 3.13.0-155.205\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-133.159~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1054-aws - 4.4.0-1027.30\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1059-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
