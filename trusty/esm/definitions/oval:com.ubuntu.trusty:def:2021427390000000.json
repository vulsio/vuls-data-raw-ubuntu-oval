		"Title": "CVE-2021-42739 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel FireDTV media card driver, where the user calls the CA_SEND_MSG ioctl. This flaw allows a local user of the host machine to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Luo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-42739` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1103-aws - 4.4.0-1103.108\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-azure - 4.15.0-1130.143~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-azure - 4.15.0-1130.143~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-generic - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-223-lowlatency - 4.4.0-223.256~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
