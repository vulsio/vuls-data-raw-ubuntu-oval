		"Title": "CVE-2019-11191 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - negligible",
		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** The Linux kernel through 5.0.7, when CONFIG_IA32_AOUT isenabled and ia32_aout is loaded, allows local users to bypass ASLR onsetuid a.out programs (if any exist) because install_exec_creds() is calledtoo late in load_aout_binary() in fs/binfmt_aout.c, and thus theptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat.NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability becauseASLR for a.out format executables has never been supported.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2019-11191` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-164-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-generic - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-164-lowlatency - 4.4.0-150.176~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1054-aws - 4.4.0-1045.48\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
