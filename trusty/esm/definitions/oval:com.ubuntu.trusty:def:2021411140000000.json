		"description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system releasedunder the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible tohost spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP Host header. TYPO3uses the HTTP Host header, for example, to generate absolute URLs duringthe frontend rendering process. Since the host header itself is provided bythe client, it can be forged to any value, even in a name-based virtualhosts environment. This vulnerability is the same as described inTYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941). A regression, introduced duringTYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing setting$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as aneffective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluatedanymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.",
