		"Title": "CVE-2018-18281 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and reused. This is fixed in the following kernel versions: 4.9.135, 4.14.78, 4.18.16, 4.19. Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18281` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-generic - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-lowlatency - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-165-generic - 3.13.0-165.215\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-generic - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-generic-lpae - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-lowlatency - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc-e500 - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc-e500mc - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc-smp - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc64-emb - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-3.13.0-165-powerpc64-smp - 3.13.0-165.215\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-165-generic - 3.13.0-165.215\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1037-azure - 4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
