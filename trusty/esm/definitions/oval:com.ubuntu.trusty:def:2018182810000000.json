		"Description": "Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushesafter dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removesentries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), astale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to aphysical page after it has been released back to the page allocator andreused. This is fixed in the following kernel versions: 4.9.135, 4.14.78,4.18.16, 4.19.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2018-18281` to fix the vulnerability.
