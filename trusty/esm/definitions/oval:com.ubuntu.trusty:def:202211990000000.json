		"Title": "CVE-2022-1199 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the Linux kernel by simulating amateur radio from the user space, resulting in a null-ptr-deref vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability. Duoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-1199` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1113-aws - 4.4.0-1113.119\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-lowlatency - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1146-azure - 4.15.0-1146.161~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-lowlatency - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
