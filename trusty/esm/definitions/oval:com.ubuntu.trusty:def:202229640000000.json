		"Title": "CVE-2022-2964 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes. Jann Horn discovered that the ASIX AX88179/178A USB Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained multiple out-of-bounds vulnerabilities. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-2964` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1113-aws - 4.4.0-1113.119\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-lowlatency - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1138-azure - 4.15.0-1138.151~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-generic - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-234-lowlatency - 4.4.0-234.268~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
