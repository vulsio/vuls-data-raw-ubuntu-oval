		"Title": "CVE-2019-10638 on Ubuntu 14.04 ESM (trusty) - medium",
		"Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.1.7, a device can be tracked by an attackerusing the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols(e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IPaddresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to thecounter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). Anattack may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC orgQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses.",
