		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phy: qcom: qmp-usbc: fix NULL-deref on runtime suspendCommit 413db06c05e7 (\"phy: qcom-qmp-usb: clean up probe initialisation\")removed most users of the platform device driver data from theqcom-qmp-usb driver, but mistakenly also removed the initialisationdespite the data still being used in the runtime PM callbacks. This bugwas later reproduced when the driver was copied to create the qmp-usbcdriver.Restore the driver data initialisation at probe to avoid a NULL-pointerdereference on runtime suspend.Apparently no one uses runtime PM, which currently needs to be enabledmanually through sysfs, with these drivers.",
