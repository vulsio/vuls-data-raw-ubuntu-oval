		"description": "MaraDNS is open-source software that implements the Domain Name System(DNS). In version 3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integerunderflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function allows anattacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal programtermination. The vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` functionwithin the `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an AnswerRR of qtype 16 (TXT record) and any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smallerthan `rdata`, the result of the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negativenumber `len = rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the`decomp_append_bytes` function without proper validation, causing theprogram to attempt to allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossibleto allocate. Consequently, the program exits with an error code of 64,causing a Denial of Service. One proposed fix for this vulnerability is topatch `Decompress.c:887` by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has beenincorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commitbab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.",
