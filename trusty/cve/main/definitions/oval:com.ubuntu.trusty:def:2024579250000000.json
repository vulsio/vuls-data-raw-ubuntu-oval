		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ksmbd: fix a missing return value check bugIn the smb2_send_interim_resp(), if ksmbd_alloc_work_struct()fails to allocate a node, it returns a NULL pointer to thein_work pointer. This can lead to an illegal memory write ofin_work->response_buf when allocate_interim_rsp_buf() attemptsto perform a kzalloc() on it.To address this issue, incorporating a check for the returnvalue of ksmbd_alloc_work_struct() ensures that the functionreturns immediately upon allocation failure, thereby preventingthe aforementioned illegal memory access.",
