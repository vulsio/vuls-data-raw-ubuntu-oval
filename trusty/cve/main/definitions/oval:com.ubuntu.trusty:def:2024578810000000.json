		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/page_alloc: don't call pfn_to_page() on possibly non-existent PFN insplit_large_buddy()In split_large_buddy(), we might call pfn_to_page() on a PFN that mightnot exist.  In corner cases, such as when freeing the highest pageblock inthe last memory section, this could result with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM &&!CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME in __pfn_to_section() returning NULL and and__section_mem_map_addr() dereferencing that NULL pointer.Let's fix it, and avoid doing a pfn_to_page() call for the firstiteration, where we already have the page.So far this was found by code inspection, but let's just CC stable as thefix is easy.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-57881` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-199-generic - 3.13.0-173.224\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-199-lowlatency - 3.13.0-173.224\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1135-aws - 4.4.0-1054.58\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1180-azure - 4.15.0-1059.64~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
