		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: use aligned address in copy_user_gigantic_page()In current kernel, hugetlb_wp() calls copy_user_large_folio() with thefault address.  Where the fault address may be not aligned with the hugepage size.  Then, copy_user_large_folio() may callcopy_user_gigantic_page() with the address, whilecopy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page sizealigned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or information leak,addtional, use more obvious naming 'addr_hint' instead of 'addr' forcopy_user_gigantic_page().",
