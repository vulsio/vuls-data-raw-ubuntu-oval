		"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in network namespaces codeaffecting the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. The function get_net_ns_by_id()in net/core/net_namespace.c does not check for the net::count value afterit has found a peer network in netns_ids idr, which could lead to doublefree and memory corruption. This vulnerability could allow an unprivilegedlocal user to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to acrash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fullyruled out, although it is thought to be unlikely.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-15129` to fix the vulnerability.
