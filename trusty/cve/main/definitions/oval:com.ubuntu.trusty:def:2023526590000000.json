		"title": "CVE-2023-52659 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium",
		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/mm:Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit type On 64-bitplatforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the input value is 64bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't get lost whenshifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physical address toprovide a virtual address for. One such example is in pvalidate_pages()(used by SEV-SNP guests), where the GFN in the struct used for page-statechange requests is a 40-bit bit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN fielddirectly into pfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealingwith addresses above the 1TB range due to the above. Fix this issue withSEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases that might cause issues incurrent/future code, by using an inline function, instead of a macro, sothat the input is implicitly cast to the expected 64-bit input type priorto performing the shift operation. While it might be argued that the issueis on the caller side, other archs/macros have taken similar approaches todeal with instances like this, such as ARM explicitly casting the input tophys_addr_t: e48866647b48 (\"ARM: 8396/1: use phys_addr_t inpfn_to_kaddr()\") A C inline function is even better though.
