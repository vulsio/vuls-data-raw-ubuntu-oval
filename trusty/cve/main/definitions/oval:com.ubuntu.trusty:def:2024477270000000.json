		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/tdx: Fix \"in-kernel MMIO\" checkTDX only supports kernel-initiated MMIO operations. The handle_mmio()function checks if the #VE exception occurred in the kernel and rejectsthe operation if it did not.However, userspace can deceive the kernel into performing MMIO on itsbehalf. For example, if userspace can point a syscall to an MMIO address,syscall does get_user() or put_user() on it, triggering MMIO #VE. Thekernel will treat the #VE as in-kernel MMIO.Ensure that the target MMIO address is within the kernel before decodinginstruction.",
