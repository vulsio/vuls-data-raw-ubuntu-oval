		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Intel guest OSusers to gain privileges or cause a denial of service because of non-atomicmodification of a live EPT PTE. When mapping guest EPT (nested paging)tables, Xen would in some circumstances use a series of non-atomic bitfieldwrites. Depending on the compiler version and optimisation flags, Xen mightexpose a dangerous partially written PTE to the hardware, which an attackermight be able to race to exploit. A guest administrator or perhaps even anunprivileged guest user might be able to cause denial of service, datacorruption, or privilege escalation. Only systems using Intel CPUs arevulnerable. Systems using AMD CPUs, and Arm systems, are not vulnerable.Only systems using nested paging (hap, aka nested paging, aka in this caseIntel EPT) are vulnerable. Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit thevulnerability. The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on theprecise optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen. If thecompiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series ofread-modify-write operations in the same order as the source code, thehypervisor is not vulnerable. For example, in one test build using GCC 8.3with normal settings, the compiler generated multiple (unlocked)read-modify-write operations in source-code order, which did not constitutea vulnerability. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently wecannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with whichcode-generation options). The source code clearly violates the C rules, andthus should be considered vulnerable.",
