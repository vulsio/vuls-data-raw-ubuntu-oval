		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:pci/hotplug/pnv_php: Fix hotplug driver crash on PowernvThe hotplug driver for powerpc (pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c) causes a kernelcrash when we try to hot-unplug/disable the PCIe switch/bridge fromthe PHB.The crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has beenreleased during disable/hot-unplug path and it has been assignedwith NULL, still during unregistration the code was again trying toexplicitly disable the MSI which causes the NULL pointer dereference andkernel crash.The patch fixes the check during unregistration path to prevent invokingpci_disable_msi/msix() since its data structure is already freed.",
