		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl In CoCo VMs it ispossible for the untrusted host to cause set_memory_encrypted() orset_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned and theresulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care to handle theseerrors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator,which could lead to functional or security issues. In order to make surecallers of vmbus_establish_gpadl() and vmbus_teardown_gpadl() don't returndecrypted/shared pages to allocators, add a field in struct vmbus_gpadl tokeep track of the decryption status of the buffers. This will allow thecallers to know if they should free or leak the pages.",
