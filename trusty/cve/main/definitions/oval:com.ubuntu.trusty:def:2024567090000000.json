		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring: check if iowq is killed before queuingtask work can be executed after the task has gone through io_uringtermination, whether it's the final task_work run or the fallback path.In this case, task work will find ->io_wq being already killed andnull'ed, which is a problem if it then tries to forward the request toio_queue_iowq(). Make io_queue_iowq() fail requests in this case.Note that it also checks PF_KTHREAD, because the user can first closea DEFER_TASKRUN ring and shortly after kill the task, in which case->iowq check would race.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-56709` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-199-generic - 3.13.0-173.224\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-199-lowlatency - 3.13.0-173.224\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1135-aws - 4.4.0-1054.58\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1180-azure - 4.15.0-1059.64~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
