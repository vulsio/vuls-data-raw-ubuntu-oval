		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hwmon: (drivetemp) Fix driver producing garbage data when SCSI errors occurscsi_execute_cmd() function can return both negative (linux codes) andpositive (scsi_cmnd result field) error codes.Currently the driver just passes error codes of scsi_execute_cmd() tohwmon core, which is incorrect because hwmon only checks for negativeerror codes. This leads to hwmon reporting uninitialized data touserspace in case of SCSI errors (for example if the disk drive wasdisconnected).This patch checks scsi_execute_cmd() output and returns -EIO if it'serror code is positive.[groeck: Avoid inline variable declaration for portability]",
