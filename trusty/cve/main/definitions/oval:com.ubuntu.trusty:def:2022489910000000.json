		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/khugepaged: invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse pathsAny codepath that zaps page table entries must invoke MMU notifiers toensure that secondary MMUs (like KVM) don't keep accessing pages whicharen't mapped anymore.  Secondary MMUs don't hold their own references topages that are mirrored over, so failing to notify them can lead to pageuse-after-free.I'm marking this as addressing an issue introduced in commit f3f0e1d2150b(\"khugepaged: add support of collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages\"), but most ofthe security impact of this only came in commit 27e1f8273113 (\"khugepaged:enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP\"), which actually omitted flushesfor the removal of present PTEs, not just for the removal of empty pagetables.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48991` to fix the vulnerability.
