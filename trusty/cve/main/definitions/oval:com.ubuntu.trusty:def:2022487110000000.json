		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tipc:improve size validations for received domain records The functiontipc_mon_rcv() allows a node to receive and process domain_record structsfrom peer nodes to track their views of the network topology. This patchverifies that the number of members in a received domain record does notexceed the limit defined by MAX_MON_DOMAIN, something that may otherwiselead to a stack overflow. tipc_mon_rcv() is called from the functiontipc_link_proto_rcv(), where we are reading a 32 bit message data lengthfield into a uint16. To avert any risk of bit overflow, we add an extrasanity check for this in that function. We cannot see that happen with thecurrent code, but future designers being unaware of this risk, mayintroduce it by allowing delivery of very large (> 64k) sk buffers from thebearer layer. This potential problem was identified by Eric Dumazet. Thisfixes CVE-2022-0435\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48711` to fix the vulnerability.
