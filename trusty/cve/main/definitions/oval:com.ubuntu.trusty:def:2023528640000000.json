		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:platform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char device Since commit fa1f68db6ca7(\"drivers: misc: pass miscdevice pointer via file private data\"), themiscdevice stores a pointer to itself inside filp->private_data, whichmeans that private_data will not be NULL when wmi_char_open() is called.This might cause memory corruption should wmi_char_open() be unable to findits driver, something which can happen when the associated WMI device isdeleted in wmi_free_devices(). Fix the problem by using the miscdevicepointer to retrieve the WMI device data associated with a char device usingcontainer_of(). This also avoids wmi_char_open() picking a wrong WMI devicebound to a driver with the same name as the original driver.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52864` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-generic-lpae - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-lowlatency - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-e500mc - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-emb - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-4.4.0-13-powerpc64-smp - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-13-generic - 4.4.0-13.29~14.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1002-aws - 4.4.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
