		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers: media: dvb-frontends/rtl2830: fix an out-of-bounds write errorEnsure index in rtl2830_pid_filter does not exceed 31 to preventout-of-bounds access.dev->filters is a 32-bit value, so set_bit and clear_bit functions shouldonly operate on indices from 0 to 31. If index is 32, it will attempt toaccess a non-existent 33rd bit, leading to out-of-bounds access.Change the boundary check from index > 32 to index >= 32 to resolve thisissue.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-47697` to fix the vulnerability.
