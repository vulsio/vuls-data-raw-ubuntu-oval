		"title": "CVE-2019-1549 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low",
		"description": "OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). Thiswas intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call inorder to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the sameRNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case.A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a highprecision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parentand child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an applicationalready calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORKthen this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected1.1.1-1.1.1c).",
