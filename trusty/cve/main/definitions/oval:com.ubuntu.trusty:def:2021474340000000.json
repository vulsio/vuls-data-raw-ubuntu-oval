		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: xhci:Fix command ring pointer corruption while aborting a command The commandring pointer is located at [6:63] bits of the command ring control register(CRCR). All the control bits like command stop, abort are located at [0:3]bits. While aborting a command, we read the CRCR and set the abort bit andwrite to the CRCR. The read will always give command ring pointer as allzeros. So we essentially write only the control bits. Since we split the 64bit write into two 32 bit writes, there is a possibility of xHC commandring stopped before the upper dword (all zeros) is written. If thathappens, xHC updates the upper dword of its internal command ring pointerwith all zeros. Next time, when the command ring is restarted, we see xHCmemory access failures. Fix this issue by only writing to the lower dwordof CRCR where all control bits are located.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47434` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1129-azure - 4.15.0-1129.142~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
