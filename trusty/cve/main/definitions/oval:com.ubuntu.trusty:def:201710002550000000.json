		"title": "CVE-2017-1000255 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high",
		"description": "On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process cancraft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will takean exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* asthe kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of thesignal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker tooverwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handlingdoes produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernelmemory has been over written. This flaw was introduced in commit:\"5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable transactional memory (TM) lazily foruserspace)\" which was merged upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note thatkernels built with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-1000255` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1023-azure - 4.15.0-1023.24~14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
