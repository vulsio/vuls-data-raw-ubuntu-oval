		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fork: only invoke khugepaged, ksm hooks if no errorThere is no reason to invoke these hooks early against an mm that is in anincomplete state.The change in commit d24062914837 (\"fork: use __mt_dup() to duplicatemaple tree in dup_mmap()\") makes this more pertinent as we may be in astate where entries in the maple tree are not yet consistent.Their placement early in dup_mmap() only appears to have been meaningfulfor early error checking, and since functionally it'd require a very smallallocation to fail (in practice 'too small to fail') that'd only occur inthe most dire circumstances, meaning the fork would fail or be OOM'd inany case.Since both khugepaged and KSM tracking are there to provide optimisationsto memory performance rather than critical functionality, it doesn'treally matter all that much if, under such dire memory pressure, we failto register an mm with these.As a result, we follow the example of commit d2081b2bf819 (\"mm:khugepaged: make khugepaged_enter() void function\") and make ksm_fork() avoid function also.We only expose the mm to these functions once we are done with them andonly if no error occurred in the fork operation.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50263` to fix the vulnerability.
