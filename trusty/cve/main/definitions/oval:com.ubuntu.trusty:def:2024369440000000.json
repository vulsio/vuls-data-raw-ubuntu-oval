		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Reapply\"drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait\" This reverts commit07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea. Stephen Rostedt reports: \"I wentto run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up. Unfortunately, themost I ever got out was: [ 93.607888] Testing event system initcall: OK [93.667730] Running tests on all trace events: [ 93.669757] Testing allevents: OK [ 95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------ Timed outafter 60 seconds\" and further debugging points to a possible circularlocking dependency between the console_owner locking and the worker poollocking. Reverting the commit allows Steve's VM to boot to completionagain. [ This may obviously result in the \"[TTM] Buffer eviction failed\"messages again, which was the reason for that original revert. But at thispoint this seems preferable to a non-booting system... ]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36944` to fix the vulnerability.
