		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before \"getting\" registersThe x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registersare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which meansthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means thatthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.Thus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.The regset code that ptrace uses provides an ->active() handler inaddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this ->active() handlerverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in thethread struct. The ->active() handler is checked from some call sites ofthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was notunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.As a result, both the set/get handlers can be called withXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() toreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has anssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stackbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). Thatcheck just happened to avoid the warning.But the ->get() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacksdisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by ChristinaSchimpe:WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198ssp_get+0x89/0xa0[...]Call Trace:<TASK>? show_regs+0x6e/0x80? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0? __warn+0x91/0x150? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0? handle_bug+0x46/0x80? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0__regset_get+0xad/0xf0copy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0ptrace_regset+0x119/0x140ptrace_request+0x13c/0x850? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90arch_ptrace+0x102/0x300[...]Ensure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them upin the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] areset at the same time, the active check ensures that there will besomething to find in the XSAVE buffer.[ dhansen: changelog/subject tweaks ]\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2025-21632` to fix the vulnerability.
