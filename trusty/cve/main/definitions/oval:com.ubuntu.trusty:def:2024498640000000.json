		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creationIn rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/Othread that will handle it.  This is a problem, however, as there's a gapbetween the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv()from the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/Othread.As a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there'sno I/O thread yet.A better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things suchthat the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.",
