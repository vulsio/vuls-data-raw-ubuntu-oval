		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/xen-netback: prevent UAF in xenvif_flush_hash()During the list_for_each_entry_rcu iteration call of xenvif_flush_hash,kfree_rcu does not exist inside the rcu read critical section, so ifkfree_rcu is called when the rcu grace period ends during the iteration,UAF occurs when accessing head->next after the entry becomes free.Therefore, to solve this, you need to change it tolist_for_each_entry_safe.",
