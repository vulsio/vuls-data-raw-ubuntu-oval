		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: hisi-kunpeng: Add verification for the max_frequency provided by thefirmwareIf the value of max_speed_hz is 0, it may cause a division by zeroerror in hisi_calc_effective_speed().The value of max_speed_hz is provided by firmware.Firmware is generally considered as a trusted domain. However, asdivision by zero errors can cause system failure, for defense measure,the value of max_speed is validated here. So 0 is regarded as invalidand an error code is returned.",
