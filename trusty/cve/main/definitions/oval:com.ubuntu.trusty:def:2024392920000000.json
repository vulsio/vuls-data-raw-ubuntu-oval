		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: um: Addwinch to winch_handlers before registering winch IRQ Registering a winchIRQ is racy, an interrupt may occur before the winch is added to thewinch_handlers list. If that happens, register_winch_irq() adds to thatlist a winch that is scheduled to be (or has already been) freed, causing apanic later in winch_cleanup(). Avoid the race by adding the winch to thewinch_handlers list before registering the IRQ, and rolling back ifum_request_irq() fails.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-39292` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-258.292~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-258.292~14.04.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-lowlatency - 4.4.0-258.292~14.04.2\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1135-aws - 4.4.0-1135.141\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1180-azure - 4.15.0-1180.195~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
