		"description": "In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Otherbranches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases in the 4.0.x series or lower andreleases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and nolonger supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect isalso present in releases from those series, but they have not beenofficially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering thedefect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: thecomponent being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package wasbuilt as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag-fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has notsuccessfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bitsystem it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improperlease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affectedsystem due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, whenrun in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified tothe compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing anobjectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally,the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the leasedatabase may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was builtfor a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flagwas NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for theoffending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to beimproperly deleted.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-25217` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nisc-dhcp-client - 4.2.4-7ubuntu12.13+esm1\nisc-dhcp-client-noddns - 4.2.4-7ubuntu12.13+esm1\nisc-dhcp-common - 4.2.4-7ubuntu12.13+esm1\nisc-dhcp-relay - 4.2.4-7ubuntu12.13+esm1\nisc-dhcp-server - 4.2.4-7ubuntu12.13+esm1\nisc-dhcp-server-ldap - 4.2.4-7ubuntu12.13+esm1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
