A denial-of-servicewas found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1: an unbounded recursion can cause Exiv2to crash by exhausting the stack. The vulnerable function,`QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The denial-of-service istriggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file.This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Thereare no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
