		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ocfs2: fix null-ptr-deref when journal load failed.During the mounting process, if journal_reset() fails because of too shortjournal, then lead to jbd2_journal_load() fails with NULL j_sb_buffer.Subsequently, ocfs2_journal_shutdown() callsjbd2_journal_flush()->jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()->__jbd2_update_log_tail()->jbd2_journal_update_sb_log_tail()->lock_buffer(journal->j_sb_buffer), resulting in a null-pointerdereference error.To resolve this issue, we should check the JBD2_LOADED flag to ensure thejournal was properly loaded.  Additionally, use journal instead ofosb->journal directly to simplify the code.",
