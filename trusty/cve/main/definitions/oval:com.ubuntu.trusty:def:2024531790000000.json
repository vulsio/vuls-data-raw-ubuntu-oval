		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing keyCustomers have reported use-after-free in @ses->auth_key.response withSMB2.1 + sign mounts which occurs due to following race:task A                         task Bcifs_mount() dfs_mount_share()  get_session()   cifs_mount_get_session()    cifs_send_recv()    cifs_get_smb_ses()          compound_send_recv()     cifs_setup_session()        smb2_setup_request()      kfree_sensitive()           smb2_calc_signature()                                   crypto_shash_setkey() *UAF*Fix this by ensuring that we have a valid @ses->auth_key.response bychecking whether @ses->ses_status is SES_GOOD or SES_EXITING with@ses->ses_lock held.  After commit 24a9799aa8ef (\"smb: client: fix UAFin smb2_reconnect_server()\"), we made sure to call ->logoff() onlywhen @ses was known to be good (e.g. valid ->auth_key.response), soit's safe to access signing key when @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING.",
