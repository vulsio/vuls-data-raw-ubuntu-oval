		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xsk: Free skb when TX metadata options are invalidWhen a new skb is allocated for transmitting an xsk descriptor, i.e., forevery non-multibuf descriptor or the first frag of a multibuf descriptor,but the descriptor is later found to have invalid options set for the TXmetadata, the new skb is never freed. This can leak skbs until the sendbuffer is full which makes sending more packets impossible.Fix this by freeing the skb in the error path if we are currently dealingwith the first frag, i.e., an skb allocated in this iteration ofxsk_build_skb.",
