		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: use aligned address in clear_gigantic_page()In current kernel, hugetlb_no_page() calls folio_zero_user() with thefault address.  Where the fault address may be not aligned with the hugepage size.  Then, folio_zero_user() may call clear_gigantic_page() withthe address, while clear_gigantic_page() requires the address to be hugepage size aligned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or informationleak, addtional, use more obvious naming 'addr_hint' instead of 'addr' forclear_gigantic_page().",
