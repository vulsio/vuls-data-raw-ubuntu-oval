		"description": "The high level operating systems (HLOS) was not providing sufficient memoryaddress information to ensure that secure applications inside QualcommSecure Execution Environment (QSEE) only write to legitimate memory rangesrelated to the QSEE secure application's HLOS client. When secureapplications inside Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) receivememory addresses from a high level operating system (HLOS) such as LinuxAndroid, those address have previously been verified as belonging to HLOSmemory space rather than QSEE memory space, but they were not verified tobe from HLOS user space rather than kernel space. This lack of verificationcould lead to privilege escalation within the HLOS.",
