		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi:iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issue A few lines above, space iskzalloc()'ed for: sizeof(struct iwl_nvm_data) + sizeof(structieee80211_channel) + sizeof(struct ieee80211_rate) 'mvm->nvm_data' is a'struct iwl_nvm_data', so it is fine. At the end of this structure, thereis the 'channels' flex array. Each element is of type 'structieee80211_channel'. So only 1 element is allocated in this array. Whendoing: mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].channels = mvm->nvm_data->channels; We pointat the first element of the 'channels' flex array. So this is fine.However, when doing: mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].bitrates = (void *)((u8*)mvm->nvm_data->channels + 1); because of the \"(u8 *)\" cast, we add only 1to the address of the beginning of the flex array. It is likely that wewant point at the 'struct ieee80211_rate' allocated just after. Remove thespurious casting so that the pointer arithmetic works as expected.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-52531` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1183-azure - 4.15.0-1183.198~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
