		"description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.4.2, the io_uring feature leads to requeststhat inadvertently have UID 0 and full capabilities, aka CID-181e448d8709.This is related to fs/io-wq.c, fs/io_uring.c, and net/socket.c. Forexample, an attacker can bypass intended restrictions on adding an IPv4address to the loopback interface. This occurs because IORING_OP_SENDMSGoperations, although requested in the context of an unprivileged user, aresometimes performed by a kernel worker thread without considering thatcontext.",
