		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: seq: Fix function prototype mismatch in snd_seq_expand_var_eventWith clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),indirect call targets are validated against the expected functionpointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigateROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.seq_copy_in_user() and seq_copy_in_kernel() did not have prototypesmatching snd_seq_dump_func_t. Adjust this and remove the casts. Thereare not resulting binary output differences.This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strictflag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,which only checks for type width mismatches.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-48994` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1162-azure - 4.15.0-1162.177~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
