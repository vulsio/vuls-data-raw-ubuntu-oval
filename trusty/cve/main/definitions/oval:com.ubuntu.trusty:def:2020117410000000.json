		"description": "An issue was discovered in xenoprof in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guestOS users (with active profiling) to obtain sensitive information aboutother guests, cause a denial of service, or possibly gain privileges. Forguests for which \"active\" profiling was enabled by the administrator, thexenoprof code uses the standard Xen shared ring structure. Unfortunately,this code did not treat the guest as a potential adversary: it trusts theguest not to modify buffer size information or modify head / tail pointersin unexpected ways. This can crash the host (DoS). Privilege escalationcannot be ruled out.",
