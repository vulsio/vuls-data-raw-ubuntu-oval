Callers need to take careto handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functionalor security issues.Leak the decrypted memory when set_memory_decrypted() fails,and don't need to print an error since set_memory_decrypted()will call WARN_ONCE().",
