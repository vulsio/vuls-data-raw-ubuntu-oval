		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gve: guard XSK operations on the existence of queuesThis patch predicates the enabling and disabling of XSK pools on theexistence of queues. As it stands, if the interface is down, disablingor enabling XSK pools would result in a crash, as the RX queue pointerwould be NULL. XSK pool registration will occur as part of the nextinterface up.Similarly, xsk_wakeup needs be guarded against queues disappearingwhile the function is executing, so a check against theGVE_PRIV_FLAGS_NAPI_ENABLED flag is added to synchronize with thedisabling of the bit and the synchronize_net() in gve_turndown.",
