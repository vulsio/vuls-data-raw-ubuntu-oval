		"description": "OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find aconfiguration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS.This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and isconfigurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. ForOpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assumethat resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-likeenvironment and the default prefix for program installation as well as forOPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windowsprograms, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted usersto modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify(or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2,'/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windowstargets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions forthe diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own--prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by thisissue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has beenassessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases atthis time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed inOpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected1.0.2-1.0.2s).",
