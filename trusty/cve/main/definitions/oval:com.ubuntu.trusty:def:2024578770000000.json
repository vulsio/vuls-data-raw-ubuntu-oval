		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POECurrently poe_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl' variable,and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave thisuninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back totarget->thread.por_el0, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory fromthe kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regsetfrom userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existingcontents of POR_EL1 will be retained.Before this patch:| # ./poe-test| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d|| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0xffff8000839c3d50After this patch:| # ./poe-test| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d|| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes|| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d",
