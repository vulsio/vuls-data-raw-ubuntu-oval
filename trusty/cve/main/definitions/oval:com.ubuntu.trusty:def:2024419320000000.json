		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched: fix warning in sched_setaffinityCommit 8f9ea86fdf99b added some logic to sched_setaffinity that includeda WARN when a per-task affinity assignment races with a cpuset update.Specifically, we can have a race where a cpuset update results in thetask affinity no longer being a subset of the cpuset. That's fine; wehave a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARNset up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all withthe requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; itstrivial to create this condition.Reproduced the warning by the following setup:- $PID inside a cpuset cgroup- another thread repeatedly switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1- another thread repeatedly setting the $PID affinity (via taskset) to 2\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-41932` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-199-generic - 3.13.0-173.224\nlinux-image-unsigned-3.13.0-199-lowlatency - 3.13.0-173.224\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-generic - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-258-lowlatency - 4.4.0-164.192~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1135-aws - 4.4.0-1054.58\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1180-azure - 4.15.0-1059.64~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro with Legacy support add-on: https://ubuntu.com/pro",
