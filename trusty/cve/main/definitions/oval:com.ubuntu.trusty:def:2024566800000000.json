		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: intel/ipu6: do not handle interrupts when device is disabledSome IPU6 devices have shared interrupts. We need to handle properlycase when interrupt is triggered from other device on shared irq lineand IPU6 itself disabled. In such case we get 0xffffffff fromISR_STATUS register and handle all irq's cases, for what we are notnot prepared and usually hang the whole system.To avoid the issue use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to check ifthe device is enabled and prevent suspending it when we handle irquntil the end of irq. Additionally use synchronize_irq() in suspend",
