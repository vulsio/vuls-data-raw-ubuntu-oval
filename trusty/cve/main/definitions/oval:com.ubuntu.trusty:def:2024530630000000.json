		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory accessThe dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is setor not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check forboundaries, as it will rely that a previous call todvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumptionthat the register functions already did the needed checks.This can be fragile if some device ends using differentcalls. This also generate warnings on static check analyserslike Coverity.So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.",
