		"description": "DomPDF before version 2.0.0 is vulnerable to PHAR deserialization due to alack of checking on the protocol before passing it into thefile_get_contents() function. An attacker who can upload files of any typeto the server can pass in the phar:// protocol to unserialize the uploadedfile and instantiate arbitrary PHP objects. This can lead to remote codeexecution, especially when DOMPdf is used with frameworks with documentedPOP chains like Laravel or vulnerable developer code.",
