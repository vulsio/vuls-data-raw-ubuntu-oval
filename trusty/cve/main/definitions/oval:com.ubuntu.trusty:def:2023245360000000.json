		"description": "Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory whenprocessing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stemsfrom several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the totalmemory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount theamount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs thanintended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressureon the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in formswith many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-livedbuffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. Thecombination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an programthat parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory,potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs thatuse mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/httppackage with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm,and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimatingthe memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-livedallocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes thefollowing limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadFormmay contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with theenvironment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed withNextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. Inaddition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 headerfields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environmentvariable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.",
