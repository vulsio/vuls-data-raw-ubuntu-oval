Specifically, it adds thenecessary deinitialization code for the cleaner shader in thegfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.The added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that anyallocated resources for the cleaner shader are freed correctly, avoidingpotential memory leaks and ensuring that the GPU state is clean for thenext initialization sequence.",
