		"description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable softwarecontainerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the datadirectory (typically `/var/lib/docker`) contained subdirectories withinsufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivilegedLinux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. Whencontainers included executable programs with extended permission bits (suchas `setuid`), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute thoseprograms. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collidedwith the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linuxuser on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This bug hasbeen fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to thisversion as soon as possible. Running containers should be stopped andrestarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgradelimit access to the host to trusted users. Limit access to host volumes totrusted containers.",
