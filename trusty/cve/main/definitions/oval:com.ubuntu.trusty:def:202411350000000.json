		"description": "Gunicorn fails to properly validate Transfer-Encoding headers, leading toHTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) vulnerabilities. By crafting requests withconflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, attackers can bypass securityrestrictions and access restricted endpoints. This issue is due toGunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, where it incorrectlyprocesses requests with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers,treating them as chunked regardless of the final encoding specified. Thisvulnerability allows for a range of attacks including cache poisoning,session manipulation, and data exposure.",
