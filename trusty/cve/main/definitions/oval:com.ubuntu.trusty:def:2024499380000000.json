		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath9k_htc: Use __skb_set_length() for resetting urb before resubmitSyzbot points out that skb_trim() has a sanity check on the existing lengthofthe skb, which can be uninitialised in some error paths. The intent here isclearly just to reset the length to zero before resubmitting, so switch tocalling __skb_set_length(skb, 0) directly. In addition, __skb_set_length()already contains a call to skb_reset_tail_pointer(), so remove theredundantcall.The syzbot report came from ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb(), but there's asimilarusage of skb_trim() in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb(), change both while we're atit.",
