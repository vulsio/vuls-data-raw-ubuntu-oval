		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Input: uinput - reject requests with unreasonable number of slotsWhen exercising uinput interface syzkaller may try setting up devicewith a really large number of slots, which causes memory allocationfailure in input_mt_init_slots(). While this allocation failure ishandled properly and request is rejected, it results in syzkallerreports. Additionally, such request may put undue burden on thesystem which will try to free a lot of memory for a bogus request.Fix it by limiting allowed number of slots to 100. This can easilybe extended if we see devices that can track more than 100 contacts.",
