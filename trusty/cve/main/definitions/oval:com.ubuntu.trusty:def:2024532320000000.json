		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/s390: Implement blocking domainThis fixes a crash when surprise hot-unplugging a PCI device. This crashhappens because during hot-unplug __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()attaching the default domain fails when the platform no longerrecognizes the device as it has already been removed and we end up witha NULL domain pointer and UAF. This is exactly the case referred to inthe second comment in __iommu_device_set_domain() and just as statedthere if we can instead attach the blocking domain the UAF is preventedas this can handle the already removed device. Implement the blockingdomain to use this handling.  With this change, the crash is fixed butwe still hit a warning attempting to change DMA ownership on a blockeddevice.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53232` to fix the vulnerability.
