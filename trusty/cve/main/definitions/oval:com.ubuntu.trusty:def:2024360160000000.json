		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tty:n_gsm: fix possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive() Assuming the following:- side A configures the n_gsm in basic option mode - side B sends theheader of a basic option mode frame with data length 1 - side A switches toadvanced option mode - side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds gsm->lenReason: gsm->len is not used in advanced option mode. - side A switches tobasic option mode - side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes pastgsm->buf Reason: Neither gsm->state nor gsm->len have been reset afterreconfiguration. Fix this by changing gsm->count to gsm->len comparisonfrom equal to less than. Also add upper limit checks against the constantMAX_MRU in gsm0_receive() and gsm1_receive() to harden against memorycorruption of gsm->len and gsm->mru. All other checks remain as we stillneed to limit the data according to the user configuration and actualpayload size.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-36016` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-257-generic - 4.4.0-257.291~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-257-generic - 4.4.0-257.291~14.04.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.4.0-257-lowlatency - 4.4.0-257.291~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-4.4.0-1134-aws - 4.4.0-1134.140\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1179-azure - 4.15.0-1179.194~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
