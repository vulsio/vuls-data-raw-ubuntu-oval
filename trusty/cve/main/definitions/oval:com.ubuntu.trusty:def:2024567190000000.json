		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: stmmac: fix TSO DMA API usage causing oopsCommit 66600fac7a98 (\"net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmapfor non-paged SKB data\") moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]'smembers to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit().The buf (dma cookie) and len stored in this structure are passed todma_unmap_single() by stmmac_tx_clean(). The DMA API requires thatthe dma cookie passed to dma_unmap_single() is the same as the valuereturned from dma_map_single(). However, by moving the assignmentlater, this is not the case when priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32 as \"des\"is offset by proto_hdr_len.This causes problems such as:  dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: Tx DMA map failedand with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled:  DMA-API: dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet: device driver tries to +free DMAmemory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000ffffcf65c0] [size=66bytes]Fix this by maintaining \"des\" as the original DMA cookie, and usetso_des to pass the offset DMA cookie to stmmac_tso_allocator().Full details of the crashes can be found at:https://lore.kernel.org/all/d8112193-0386-4e14-b516-37c2d838171a@nvidia.com/https://lore.kernel.org/all/klkzp5yn5kq5efgtrow6wbvnc46bcqfxs65nz3qy77ujr5turc@bwwhelz2l4dw/",
