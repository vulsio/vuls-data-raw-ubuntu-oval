		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: comedi:ni_usb6501: fix NULL-deref in command paths The driver uses endpoint-sizedUSB transfer buffers but had no sanity checks on the sizes. This can leadto zero-size-pointer dereferences or overflowed transfer buffers inni6501_port_command() and ni6501_counter_command() if a (malicious) devicehas smaller max-packet sizes than expected (or when doing descriptor fuzztesting). Add the missing sanity checks to probe().\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47476` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-3.11.0-12-generic-lpae - 3.11.0-12.19\nlinux-image-extra-3.11.0-12-generic - 3.11.0-12.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-4.15.0-1130-azure - 4.15.0-1130.143~14.04.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro (Infra-only): https://ubuntu.com/pro",
