		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ethtool: do not perform operations on net devices being unregistered Thereis a short period between a net device starts to be unregistered and whenit is actually gone. In that time frame ethtool operations could still beperformed, which might end up in unwanted or undefined behaviours[1]. Donot allow ethtool operations after a net device starts its unregistration.This patch targets the netlink part as the ioctl one isn't affected: thereference to the net device is taken and the operation is executed withinan rtnl lock section and the net device won't be found after unregister.[1] For example adding Tx queues after unregister ends up in NULL pointerexceptions and UaFs, such as: BUG: KASAN: use-after-free inkobject_get+0x14/0x90 Read of size 1 at addr ffff88801961248c by taskethtool/755 CPU: 0 PID: 755 Comm: ethtool Not tainted 5.15.0-rc6+ #778Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-4.fc3404/014 Call Trace: dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x72print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1f/0x140kasan_report.cold+0x7f/0x11b kobject_get+0x14/0x90kobject_add_internal+0x3d1/0x450 kobject_init_and_add+0xba/0xf0netdev_queue_update_kobjects+0xcf/0x200netif_set_real_num_tx_queues+0xb4/0x310 veth_set_channels+0x1c3/0x550ethnl_set_channels+0x524/0x610\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47517` to fix the vulnerability.
