		"title": "CVE-2023-23612 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) - medium",
		"description": "OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine.OpenSearch uses JWTs to store role claims obtained from the IdentityProvider (IdP) when the authentication backend is SAML or OpenID Connect.There is an issue in how those claims are processed from the JWTs where theleading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, allowing users to potentiallyclaim roles they are not assigned to if any role matches thewhitespace-stripped version of the roles they are a member of. This issueis only present for authenticated users, and it requires either theexistence of roles that match, not considering leading/trailing whitespace,or the ability for users to create said matching roles. In addition, theIdentity Provider must allow leading and trailing spaces in role names.OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1 are affected. Users are advised toupgrade to OpenSearch 1.3.8 or 2.5.0. There are no known workarounds forthis issue.",
