		"description": "In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fieldsprovided to the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it is notpossible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\nis in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd filewhen viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work aroundblocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that anew user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able toconvince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect,social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that \"cat/etc/passwd\" shows a rogue user account.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-29383` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibsubid4 - 1:4.13+dfsg1-4ubuntu1\nlogin - 1:4.13+dfsg1-4ubuntu1\npasswd - 1:4.13+dfsg1-4ubuntu1\nuidmap - 1:4.13+dfsg1-4ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
