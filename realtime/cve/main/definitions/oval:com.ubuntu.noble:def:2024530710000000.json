		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/panthor: Be stricter about IO mapping flagsThe current panthor_device_mmap_io() implementation has two issues:1. For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,   panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear   VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping   writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.   I don't think this actually has any impact in practice:   When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and   when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the   driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing   writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*   flushes happen.2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are   mappings without the VM_SHARED flag).   MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has   copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but   fairly cursed.   In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs   during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()   wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into   the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault   handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so   if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when   it hits a BUG() check.Fix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_IDdoesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics forthe FLUSH_ID don't make sense).Reproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailinglist; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.Note that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don'thave a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet. Please test itbefore applying it.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-53071` to fix the vulnerability.
