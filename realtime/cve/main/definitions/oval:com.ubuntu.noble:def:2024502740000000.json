		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:idpf: avoid vport access in idpf_get_link_ksettingsWhen the device control plane is removed or the platformrunning device control plane is rebooted, a reset is detectedon the driver. On driver reset, it releases the resources andwaits for the reset to complete. If the reset fails, it takesthe error path and releases the vport lock. At this time if themonitoring tools tries to access link settings, it call tracesfor accessing released vport pointer.To avoid it, move link_speed_mbps to netdev_priv structurewhich removes the dependency on vport pointer and the vport lockin idpf_get_link_ksettings. Also use netif_carrier_ok()to check the link status and adjust the offsetof to use link_upinstead of link_speed_mbps.",
