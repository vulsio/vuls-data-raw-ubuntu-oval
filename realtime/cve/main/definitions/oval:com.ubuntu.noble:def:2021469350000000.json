		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder:fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels In 4.13, commit74310e06be4d (\"android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with userspace\") fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads sothe driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronoustransactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.Unfortunately, on the \"free\" side, the accounting of async_free_space didnot add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes ofasync_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or less.These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue has goneundetected for several years. The fix is to use \"buffer_size\" (theallocated buffer size) instead of \"size\" (the logical buffer size) whenupdating the async_free_space during the free operation. These are the sameexcept for this corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8bytes.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-46935` to fix the vulnerability.
