		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safeOn ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to amutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:\tBUG: sleeping function called from invalid context atkernel/locking/mutex.c:585\t...\tCall trace:\t__might_sleep\t__mutex_lock_common\tmutex_lock_nested\tacpi_subsys_runtime_resume\trpm_resume\ttegra_i2c_xferThe problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock&dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later,rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies onmutexes, triggering the error.To address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe,considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.",
