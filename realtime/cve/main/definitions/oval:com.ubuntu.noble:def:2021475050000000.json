		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: aio:fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling signalfd_poll() andbinder_poll() are special in that they use a waitqueue whose lifetime isthe current task, rather than the struct file as is normally the case. Thisis okay for blocking polls, since a blocking poll occurs within one task;however, non-blocking polls require another solution. This solution is forthe queue to be cleared before it is freed, by sending a POLLFREEnotification to all waiters. Unfortunately, only eventpoll handlesPOLLFREE. A second type of non-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernelv4.18, and it doesn't handle POLLFREE. This allows a use-after-free tooccur if a signalfd or binder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueuegets freed. Fix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE. A patch by RamjiJiyani <ramjiyani@google.com>(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)tried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the requestinline if POLLFREE is seen. However, that solution had two bugs. First, itintroduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio context whileholding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal locking order. Second,it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications are missed while the requesthas been temporarily de-queued. The second problem was solved by myprevious patch. This patch then properly fixes the use-after-free byhandling POLLFREE in a deadlock-free way. It does this by taking advantageof the fact that freeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to whateventpoll does.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-47505` to fix the vulnerability.
