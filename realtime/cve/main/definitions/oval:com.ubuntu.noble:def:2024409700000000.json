		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Avoid hw_desc array overrun in dw-axi-dmacI have a use case where nr_buffers = 3 and in which each descriptor iscomposed by 3segments, resulting in the DMA channel descs_allocated to be 9. Sinceaxi_desc_put()handles the hw_desc considering the descs_allocated, this scenario wouldresult in akernel panic (hw_desc array will be overrun).To fix this, the proposal is to add a new member to the axi_dma_descstructure,where we keep the number of allocated hw_descs (axi_desc_alloc()) and useit inaxi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.Additionally I propose to remove the axi_chan_start_first_queued() callafter completingthe transfer, since it was identified that unbalance can occur (starteddescriptors canbe interrupted and transfer ignored due to DMA channel not being enabled).\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-40970` to fix the vulnerability.
