However thenext allocation from the same bitmap will notice the bitmap buffer isalready loaded and tries to allocate from the bitmap with mixed results(depending on the exact nature of the bitmap corruption). Fix theproblem by using BH_verified bit to indicate whether the bitmap is validor not.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-42306` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1016.23\nNo subscription required",
