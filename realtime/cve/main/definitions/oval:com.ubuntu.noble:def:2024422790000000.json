		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of atransferWhile transmitting with rx_len == 0, the RX FIFO is not going to beemptied in the interrupt handler. A subsequent transfer could thenread crap from the previous transfer out of the RX FIFO into thestart RX buffer. The core provides a register that will empty the RX andTX FIFOs, so do that before each transfer.",
