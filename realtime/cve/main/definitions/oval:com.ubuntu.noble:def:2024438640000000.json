		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: Fix CT entry update leaks of modify header contextThe cited commit allocates a new modify header to replace the oldone when updating CT entry. But if failed to allocate a new one, eg.exceed the max number firmware can support, modify header will bean error pointer that will trigger a panic when deallocating it. Andthe old modify header point is copied to old attr. When the oldattr is freed, the old modify header is lost.Fix it by restoring the old attr to attr when failed to allocate anew modify header context. So when the CT entry is freed, the rightmodify header context will be freed. And the panic of accessingerror pointer is also fixed.",
