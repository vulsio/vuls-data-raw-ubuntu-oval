		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spi: rockchip: Resolve unbalanced runtime PM / system PM handlingCommit e882575efc77 (\"spi: rockchip: Suspend and resume the bus duringNOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM ops\") stopped respecting runtime PM status andsimply disabled clocks unconditionally when suspending the system. Thiscauses problems when the device is already runtime suspended when we goto sleep -- in which case we double-disable clocks and produce aWARNing.Switch back to pm_runtime_force_{suspend,resume}(), because that stillseems like the right thing to do, and the aforementioned commit makes noexplanation why it stopped using it.Also, refactor some of the resume() error handling, because it's notactually a good idea to re-disable clocks on failure.",
