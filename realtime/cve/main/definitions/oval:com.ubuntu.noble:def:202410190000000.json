		"description": "ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypassfor path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs.ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in request URLsbefore it separates the URL path component from the optional query stringcomponent. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC compliantback-end applications. The vulnerability hides an attack payload in thepath component of the URL from WAF rules inspecting it. A back-end may bevulnerable if it uses the path component of request URLs to constructqueries. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.0.12. TheModSecurity v2 release line is not affected by this vulnerability.",
