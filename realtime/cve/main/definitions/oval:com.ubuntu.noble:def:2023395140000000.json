		"description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault managementframework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison datastored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed byadministrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim'sbrowser at view-time. The script under `graphs.php` displays graph detailssuch as data-source paths, data template information and graph relatedfields. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure either adata-source template with malicious code appended in the data-source nameor a device with a malicious payload injected in the device name, maydeploy a stored XSS attack against any user with _GeneralAdministration>Graphs_ privileges. A user that possesses the _TemplateEditor>Data Templates_ permissions can configure the data-source name in_cacti_. Please note that this may be a _low privileged_ user. Thisconfiguration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_templates.php` byediting an existing or adding a new data template. If a template is linkedto a graph then the formatted template name will be rendered in the graph'smanagement page. A user that possesses the _GeneralAdministration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the devicename in _cacti_. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25.Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should add manualHTML escaping.",
