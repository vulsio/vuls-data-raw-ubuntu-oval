		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf, arm64: Fix address emission with tag-based KASAN enabledWhen BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is enabled, the address of a bpf_tramp_imagestruct on the stack is passed during the size calculation pass andan address on the heap is passed during code generation. This maycause a heap buffer overflow if the heap address is tagged becauseemit_a64_mov_i64() will emit longer code than it did during the sizecalculation pass. The same problem could occur without tag-basedKASAN if one of the 16-bit words of the stack address happened tobe all-ones during the size calculation pass. Fix the problem byassuming the worst case (4 instructions) when calculating the sizeof the bpf_tramp_image address emission.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-50203` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1008-aws - 6.5.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-azure - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1007-gcp - 6.5.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-gke - 6.8.0-1003.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1009-ibm - 6.5.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-9-lowlatency-64k - 6.5.0-9.9.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.5.0-1010-oracle - 6.5.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1003-oem - 6.8.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.5.0-1005-raspi - 6.5.0-1005.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.7.0-2001-raspi-realtime - 6.7.0-2001.1\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1008-realtime - 6.8.0-1008.19\nAvailable with Ubuntu Pro: https://ubuntu.com/pro\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-1005-intel - 6.8.0-1001.6\nNo subscription required",
