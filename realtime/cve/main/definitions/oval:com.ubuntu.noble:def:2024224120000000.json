		"description": "ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system. Abug exists in the cloud ClickHouse offering prior to version 24.0.2.54535and in github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse version 23.1. Query cachingbypasses the role based access controls and the policies being enforced onroles. In affected versions, the query cache only respects separate users,however this is not documented and not expected behavior. People relying onClickHouse roles can have their access control lists bypassed if they areusing query caching. Attackers who have control of a role could guessqueries and see data they shouldn't have access to. Version 24.1 ofClickHouse and version 24.0.2.54535 of ClickHouse Cloud contain a patch forthis issue. Based on the documentation, role based access control should beenforced regardless if query caching is enabled or not.",
