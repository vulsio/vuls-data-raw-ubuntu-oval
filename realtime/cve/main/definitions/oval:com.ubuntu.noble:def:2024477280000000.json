		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Zero former ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} args in case of errorFor all non-tracing helpers which formerly had ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} asinputarguments, zero the value for the case of an error as otherwise it couldleakmemory. For tracing, it is not needed given CAP_PERFMON can already readallkernel memory anyway hence bpf_get_func_arg() and bpf_get_func_ret() isskippedin here.Also, the MTU helpers mtu_len pointer value is being written but also read.Technically, the MEM_UNINIT should not be there in order to always forceinit.Removing MEM_UNINIT needs more verifier rework though: MEM_UNINIT right nowimplies two things actually: i) write into memory, ii) memory does not haveto be initialized. If we lift MEM_UNINIT, it then becomes: i) read intomemory,ii) memory must be initialized. This means that for bpf_*_check_mtu() we'rereadding the issue we're trying to fix, that is, it would then be able towrite back into things like .rodata BPF maps. Follow-up work will reworktheMEM_UNINIT semantics such that the intent can be better expressed. For nowjust clear the *mtu_len on error path which can be lifted later again.",
