		"description": "Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN,Infinity, and -Infinity JSON values in fields of m.room.member events,allowing remote attackers to execute a denial of service attack against thefederation and common Matrix clients. If such a malformed event is acceptedinto the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by anupgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redactedinstead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members, theimpact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-26890` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmatrix-synapse - 1.23.0-1\nNo subscription required",
