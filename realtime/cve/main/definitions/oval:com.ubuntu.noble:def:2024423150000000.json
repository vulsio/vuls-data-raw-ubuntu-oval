		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:exfat: fix potential deadlock on __exfat_get_dentry_setWhen accessing a file with more entries than ES_MAX_ENTRY_NUM, the bh-arrayis allocated in __exfat_get_entry_set. The problem is that the bh-array isallocated with GFP_KERNEL. It does not make sense. In the following cases,a deadlock for sbi->s_lock between the two processes may occur.
