		"description": "Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. In affected versionsclients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such asX-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header(X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected.v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if thenon-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy definedheaders to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has aunderscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers atthe proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting theproxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so untilupgraded to the fixed versions.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2024-45614` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npuma - 6.4.2-4ubuntu4.3\nNo subscription required",
