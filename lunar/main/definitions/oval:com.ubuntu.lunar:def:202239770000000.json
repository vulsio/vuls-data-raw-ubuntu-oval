		"Title": "CVE-2022-3977 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel MCTP (Management Component Transport Protocol) functionality. This issue occurs when a user simultaneously calls DROPTAG ioctl and socket close happens, which could allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the MCTP implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3977` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic-lpae - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic-lpae - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required",
