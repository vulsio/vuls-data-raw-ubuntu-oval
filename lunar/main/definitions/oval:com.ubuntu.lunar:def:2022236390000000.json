		"Title": "CVE-2022-23639 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"Description": "crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scopedthreads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust.crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that thealignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, thealignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than`Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race.Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected bythis issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets arenot affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7.There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23639` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 1:1snap1-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nlibstd-rust-1.61 - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nrust-all - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nrust-clippy - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nrust-gdb - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nrust-lldb - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nrust-src - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nrustc - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nrustfmt - 1.61.0+dfsg1-1~exp1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\ngir1.2-rsvg-2.0 - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nlibrsvg2-2 - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nlibrsvg2-bin - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nlibrsvg2-common - 2.52.5+dfsg-3\nNo subscription required",
