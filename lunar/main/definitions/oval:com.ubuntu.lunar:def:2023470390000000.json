		"Title": "CVE-2023-47039 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - negligible.",
		"Description": "[Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the  shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable which uses Windows Perl  interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating  system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for  cmd.exe in the current working directory.  An attacker with limited privileges  can exploit this behavior by placing `cmd.exe` in locations with weak  permissions, such as `C:\\ProgramData`. By doing so, when an administrator  attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations, arbitrary  code can be executed.]",
