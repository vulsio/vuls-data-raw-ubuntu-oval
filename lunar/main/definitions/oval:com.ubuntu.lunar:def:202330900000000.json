    "Title": "CVE-2023-3090 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - high.",
    "Description": "A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb->cb initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled. We recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e. It was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of- bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3090` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic-64k - 6.2.0-26.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-aws - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-gcp - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1006-ibm - 6.2.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-kvm - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1009.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-oracle - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1009-raspi - 6.2.0-1009.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic-64k - 6.2.0-26.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-aws - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-gcp - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1006-ibm - 6.2.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-kvm - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1009.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-oracle - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1002-starfive - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
