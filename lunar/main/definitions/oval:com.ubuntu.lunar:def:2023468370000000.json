		"description": "Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache for a givenregion. This is, for instance, used when allocating guest memory to ensureany writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached memory beforehanding over the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the arithmetics in thehelpers can overflow and would then result to skip the cachecleaning/invalidation. Therefore there is no guarantee when all the writeswill reach the memory. This undefined behavior was meant to be addressed byXSA-437, but the approach was not sufficient.",
