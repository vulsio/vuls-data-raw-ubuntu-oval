		"Title": "CVE-2022-41674 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19.16. Attackers able to inject WLAN frames could cause a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c. Sönke Huster discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-41674` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic-64k - 5.19.0-23.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-6.2.0-36-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-36-generic-64k - 5.19.0-23.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required",
