    "Title": "CVE-2023-32248 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2_TREE_CONNECT and SMB2_QUERY_INFO commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a pointer prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Quentin Minster discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate pointers in some situations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-32248` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic-64k - 6.2.0-27.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-azure - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-gcp - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1007-ibm - 6.2.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-kvm - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1010.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-oracle - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1010-raspi - 6.2.0-1010.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic-64k - 6.2.0-27.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-azure - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-gcp - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1007-ibm - 6.2.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-kvm - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1010.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-oracle - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1002-starfive - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
