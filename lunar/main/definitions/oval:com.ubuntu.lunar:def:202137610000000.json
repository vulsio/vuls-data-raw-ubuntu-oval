		"Title": "CVE-2021-3761 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "Any CA issuer in the RPKI can trick OctoRPKI prior to 1.3.0 into emitting an invalid VRP \"MaxLength\" value, causing RTR sessions to terminate. An attacker can use this to disable RPKI Origin Validation in a victim network (for example AS 13335 - Cloudflare) prior to launching a BGP hijack which during normal operations would be rejected as \"RPKI invalid\". Additionally, in certain deployments RTR session flapping in and of itself also could cause BGP routing churn, causing availability issues.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3761` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\noctorpki - 1.4.3-1\nNo subscription required",
