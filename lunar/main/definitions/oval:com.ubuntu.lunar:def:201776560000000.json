		"description": "In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), HTTP/0.9is handled poorly. An HTTP/1 style request line (i.e. method space URIspace version) that declares a version of HTTP/0.9 was accepted and treatedas a 0.9 request. If deployed behind an intermediary that also accepted andpassed through the 0.9 version (but did not act on it), then the responsesent could be interpreted by the intermediary as HTTP/1 headers. This couldbe used to poison the cache if the server allowed the origin client togenerate arbitrary content in the response.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-7656` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njetty9 - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-extra-java - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-java - 9.2.26-1\nNo subscription required",
