		"Title": "CVE-2022-45919 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - low.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. In drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c, a use-after-free can occur is there is a disconnect after an open, because of the lack of a wait_event. Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-45919` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic-64k - 6.2.0-34.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-aws - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-gcp - 6.2.0-1016.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-kvm - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1014.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-oracle - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1014-raspi - 6.2.0-1014.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic-64k - 6.2.0-34.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-aws - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-gcp - 6.2.0-1016.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-kvm - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1014.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-oracle - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1006-starfive - 6.2.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required",
