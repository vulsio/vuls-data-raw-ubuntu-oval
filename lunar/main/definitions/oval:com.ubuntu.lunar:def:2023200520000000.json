    "Title": "CVE-2023-20052 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
    "Description": "On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library was disclosed: A vulnerability in the DMG file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to enabling XML entity substitution that may result in XML external entity injection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted DMG file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to leak bytes from any file that may be read by the ClamAV scanning process.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-20052` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nclamav - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nclamav-base - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nclamav-daemon - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nclamav-freshclam - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nclamav-milter - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nclamav-testfiles - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nclamdscan - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nlibclamav9 - 0.103.8+dfsg-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
