		"description": "Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARMplatform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,leading to a crash. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTSalgorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. TheAES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption. The AES-XTS cipherdecryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end ofthe ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte blocks,e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer isunmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service.If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext bufferbeing decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, theapplication is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a Lowseverity one.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-1255` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl3 - 3.0.8-1ubuntu1.2\nopenssl - 3.0.8-1ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
