		"Title": "CVE-2023-32258 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw exists within the processing of SMB2_LOGOFF and SMB2_CLOSE commands. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel when handling session connections, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-32258` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-32.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic-64k - 6.2.0-32.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-aws - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-azure - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-gcp - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-ibm - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-kvm - 6.2.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1012.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-oracle - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1012-raspi - 6.2.0-1012.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32\nlinux-image-6.2.0-32-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-32.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic - 6.2.0-32.32\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-32-generic-64k - 6.2.0-32.32\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-aws - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-azure - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-gcp - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-ibm - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-kvm - 6.2.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1012.12\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1012-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1012.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-oracle - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1004-starfive - 6.2.0-1004.5\nNo subscription required",
