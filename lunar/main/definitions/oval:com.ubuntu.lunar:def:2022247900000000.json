		"Title": "CVE-2022-24790 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, parallel HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. When using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a request starts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround: when deploying a proxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24790` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npuma - 5.6.5-3ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
