		"Title": "CVE-2023-38427 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.8. fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c in ksmbd has an integer underflow and out-of-bounds read in deassemble_neg_contexts. It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an integer underflow and out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38427` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic-64k - 6.2.0-34.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-aws - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-gcp - 6.2.0-1016.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-kvm - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1014.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-oracle - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1014-raspi - 6.2.0-1014.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-6.2.0-34-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic - 6.2.0-34.34\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-34-generic-64k - 6.2.0-34.34\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-aws - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-azure - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-gcp - 6.2.0-1016.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-kvm - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1014.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1013-oracle - 6.2.0-1013.13\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1006-starfive - 6.2.0-1006.7\nNo subscription required",
