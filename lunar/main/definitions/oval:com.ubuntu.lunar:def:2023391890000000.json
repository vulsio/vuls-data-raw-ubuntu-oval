		"Title": "CVE-2023-39189 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The nfnl_osf_add_callback function did not validate the user mode controlled opt_num field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure. Lucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-39189` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-39.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1017.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-azure - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1019-gcp - 6.2.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-kvm - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1018.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-oracle - 6.2.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1017-raspi - 6.2.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-39.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1017.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-azure - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1019-gcp - 6.2.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-kvm - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1018.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-oracle - 6.2.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required",
