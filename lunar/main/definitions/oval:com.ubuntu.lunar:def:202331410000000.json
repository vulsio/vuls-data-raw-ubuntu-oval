    "Title": "CVE-2023-3141 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - low.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in r592_remove in drivers/memstick/host/r592.c in media access in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system at device disconnect, possibly leading to a kernel information leak. It was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3141` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic-64k - 6.2.0-27.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-azure - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-gcp - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1007-ibm - 6.2.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-kvm - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1010.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-oracle - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1010-raspi - 6.2.0-1010.12\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-6.2.0-27-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic - 6.2.0-27.28\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-27-generic-64k - 6.2.0-27.28\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-aws - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-azure - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1011-gcp - 6.2.0-1011.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1007-ibm - 6.2.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-kvm - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1010.10\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-oracle - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1002-starfive - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
