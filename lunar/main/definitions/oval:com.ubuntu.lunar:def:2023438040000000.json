    "Title": "CVE-2023-43804 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
    "Description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user. However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-43804` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-pip - 23.0.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.2\npython3-pip-whl - 23.0.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required\n\npython3-urllib3 - 1.26.12-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
