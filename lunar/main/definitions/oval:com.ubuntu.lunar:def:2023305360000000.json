		"Title": "CVE-2023-30536 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"Description": "slim/psr7 is a PSR-7 implementation for use with Slim 4. In versions priorto 1.6.1 an attacker could sneak in a newline (\\n) into both the headernames and values. While the specification states that \\r\\n\\r\\n is used toterminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \\n\\n.An attacker that is able to control the header names that are passed toSlilm-Psr7 would be able to intentionally craft invalid messages, possiblycausing application errors or invalid HTTP requests being sent out with anPSR-18 HTTP client. The latter might present a denial of service vector ifa remote serviceâ€™s web application firewall bans the application due to thereceipt of malformed requests. The issue has been patched in version 1.6.1.There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.",
