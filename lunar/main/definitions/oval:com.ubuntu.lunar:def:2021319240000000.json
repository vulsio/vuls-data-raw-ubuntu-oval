		"Description": "Yubico pam-u2f before 1.1.1 has a logic issue that, depending on thepam-u2f configuration and the application used, could lead to a local PINbypass. This issue does not allow user presence (touch) or cryptographicsignature verification to be bypassed, so an attacker would still need tophysically possess and interact with the YubiKey or another enrolledauthenticator. If pam-u2f is configured to require PIN authentication, andthe application using pam-u2f allows the user to submit NULL as the PIN,pam-u2f will attempt to perform a FIDO2 authentication without PIN. If thisauthentication is successful, the PIN requirement is bypassed.",
