		"Note": "ccdm94> the embedded ujson code in pandas, eventhough containing similar content as the upstream ujson code, seems to have diverged from the ujson upstream project (they have fully forked ujson), since pandas upstream is maintaining their own ujson bug fixes and changes without re-syncing with the ujson upstream project. There is no indication the ujson fork, as used in pandas, is vulnerable to the same issues as the upstream ujson code."
