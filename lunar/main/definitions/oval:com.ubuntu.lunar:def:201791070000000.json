		"description": "An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It overruns reading a bufferif a domain ends with backslash. If the query domain ended with \\, andadns_qf_quoteok_query was specified, qdparselabel would read additionalbytes from the buffer and try to treat them as the escape sequence. Itwould depart the input buffer and start processing many bytes of arbitraryheap data as if it were the query domain. Eventually it would run out ofinput or find some other kind of error, and declare the query domaininvalid. But before then it might outrun available memory and crash. Inprinciple this could be a denial of service attack.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2017-9107` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nadns-tools - 1.6.0-2\nlibadns1 - 1.6.0-2\nNo subscription required",
