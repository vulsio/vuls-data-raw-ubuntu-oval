		"Title": "CVE-2023-5178 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution or lead to local privilege escalation in case that the attacker already has local privileges. Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-5178` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-39.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1017.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1018-gcp - 6.2.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-kvm - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1018.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-oracle - 6.2.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1017-raspi - 6.2.0-1018.20\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.2.0-39.40\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.2.0-39.40\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-aws - 6.2.0-1017.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-azure - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1018-gcp - 6.2.0-1020.22\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-kvm - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1018.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1018.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1016-oracle - 6.2.0-1017.18\nNo subscription required",
