		"Title": "CVE-2018-14028 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"Description": "In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified asbeing ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP fileis uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in apredictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to thenexecute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarioswhere an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for pluginuploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIPfile and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/pluginsdirectory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.",
