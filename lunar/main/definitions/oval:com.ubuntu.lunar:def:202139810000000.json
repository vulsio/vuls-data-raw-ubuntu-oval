    "Description": "A flaw in grub2 was found where its configuration file, known as grub.cfg, is being created with the wrong permission set allowing non privileged users to read its content. This represents a low severity confidentiality issue, as those users can eventually read any encrypted passwords present in grub.cfg. This flaw affects grub2 2.06 and previous versions. This issue has been fixed in grub upstream but no version with the fix is currently released.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-3981` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.192\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.192\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.06-2ubuntu16\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu16\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.06-2ubuntu16\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.06-2ubuntu16\nNo subscription required",
