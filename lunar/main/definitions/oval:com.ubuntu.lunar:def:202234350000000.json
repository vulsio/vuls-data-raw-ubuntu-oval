    "Title": "CVE-2022-3435 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function fib_nh_match of the file net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c of the component IPv4 Handler. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-210357 was assigned to this vulnerability. Gwangun Jung discovered a race condition in the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel when deleting multipath routes, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3435` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic-lpae - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-6.1.0-16-generic-lpae - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic - 6.1.0-16.16\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.1.0-16-generic-64k - 6.1.0-16.16\nNo subscription required",
