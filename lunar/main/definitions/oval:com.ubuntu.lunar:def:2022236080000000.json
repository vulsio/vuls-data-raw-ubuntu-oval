    "Title": "CVE-2022-23608 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - low.",
    "Description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-23608` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njami - 20230206.0~ds1-5\njami-daemon - 20230206.0~ds1-5\nNo subscription required",
