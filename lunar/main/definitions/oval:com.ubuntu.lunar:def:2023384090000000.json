    "Description": "An issue was discovered in set_con2fb_map in drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.12. Because an assignment occurs only for the first vc, the fbcon_registered_fb and fbcon_display arrays can be desynchronized in fbcon_mode_deleted (the con2fb_map points at the old fb_info).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-38409` to fix the vulnerability.
