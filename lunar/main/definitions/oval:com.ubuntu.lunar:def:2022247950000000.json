		"title": "CVE-2022-24795 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"description": "yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library.The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflowwhich leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large(~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the`need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation ofbuf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t`in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue fromtriggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issuetriggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequentpopulation of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the originalbuffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostlyimpacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation forarbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipatedto be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing largeinputs to YAJL.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-24795` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibyajl2 - 2.1.0-3ubuntu0.23.04.1\nyajl-tools - 2.1.0-3ubuntu0.23.04.1\nNo subscription required",
