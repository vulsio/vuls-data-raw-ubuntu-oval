		"Title": "CVE-2023-46724 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-46724` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 5.7-1ubuntu3.1\nsquid-cgi - 5.7-1ubuntu3.1\nsquid-common - 5.7-1ubuntu3.1\nsquid-openssl - 5.7-1ubuntu3.1\nsquid-purge - 5.7-1ubuntu3.1\nsquidclient - 5.7-1ubuntu3.1\nNo subscription required",
