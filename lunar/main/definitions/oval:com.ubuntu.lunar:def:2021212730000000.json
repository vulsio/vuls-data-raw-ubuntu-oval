		"Title": "CVE-2021-21273 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, requests to user provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events and sending push notifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-21273` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmatrix-synapse - 1.26.0-3\nNo subscription required",
