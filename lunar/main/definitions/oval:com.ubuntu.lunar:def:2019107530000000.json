		"Title": "CVE-2019-10753 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - low",
		"Description": "In all versions prior to version 3.9.6 for eclipse-wtp, all versions priorto version 9.4.4 for eclipse-cdt, and all versions prior to version 3.0.1for eclipse-groovy, Spotless was resolving dependencies over an insecurechannel (http). If the build occurred over an insecure connection, amalicious user could have perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during thebuild and alter the build artifacts that were produced. In case that any ofthese artifacts were compromised, any developers using these could bealtered. **Note:** In order to validate that this artifact was notcompromised, the maintainer would need to confirm that none of theartifacts published to the registry were not altered with. Until thishappens, we can not guarantee that this artifact was not compromised eventhough the probability that this happened is low.",
