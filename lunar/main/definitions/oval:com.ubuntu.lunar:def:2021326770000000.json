		"Title": "CVE-2021-32677 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"Description": "FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based onstandard Python type hints. FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that usedcookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloadssent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read therequest payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set toapplication/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g.application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plaincontaining JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would beextracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORSpreflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will executethem right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSONstring that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. Thisis fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only ifthe content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatiblemedia type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latestFastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependencythat checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is notapplication/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as amitigating workaround.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2021-32677` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-fastapi - 0.74.1-1\nNo subscription required",
