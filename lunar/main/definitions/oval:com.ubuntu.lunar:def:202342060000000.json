    "Title": "CVE-2023-4206 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - high.",
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_route component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. When route4_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4206` to fix the vulnerability.
