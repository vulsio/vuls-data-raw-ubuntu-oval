		"title": "CVE-2023-49284 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"description": "fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux, andthe rest of the family. fish shell uses certain Unicode non-charactersinternally for marking wildcards and expansions. It will incorrectly allowthese markers to be read on command substitution output, rather thantransforming them into a safe internal representation. While this may causeunexpected behavior with direct input (for example, echo \\UFDD2HOME has thesame output as echo $HOME), this may become a minor security problem if theoutput is being fed from an external program into a command substitutionwhere this output may not be expected. This design flaw was introduced invery early versions of fish, predating the version control system, and isthought to be present in every version of fish released in the last 15years or more, although with different characters. Code execution does notappear to be possible, but denial of service (through large braceexpansion) or information disclosure (such as variable expansion) ispotentially possible under certain circumstances. fish shell 3.6.2 has beenreleased to correct this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are noknown workarounds for this vulnerability.",
