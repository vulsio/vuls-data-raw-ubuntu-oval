    "Title": "CVE-2019-14899 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - low.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, iOS, and Android that allows a malicious access point, or an adjacent user, to determine if a connected user is using a VPN, make positive inferences about the websites they are visiting, and determine the correct sequence and acknowledgement numbers in use, allowing the bad actor to inject data into the TCP stream. This provides everything that is needed for an attacker to hijack active connections inside the VPN tunnel.",
