    "Title": "CVE-2023-23005 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
    "Description": "** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel before 6.2, mm/memory-tiers.c misinterprets the alloc_memory_type return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually an error pointer). NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because there are no realistic cases in which a user can cause the alloc_memory_type error case to be reached.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-23005` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1004-raspi - 5.19.0-1004.10\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1004-raspi-nolpae - 5.19.0-1004.10\nNo subscription required",
