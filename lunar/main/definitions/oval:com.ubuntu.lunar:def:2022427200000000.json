		"Title": "CVE-2022-42720 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "Various refcounting bugs in the multi-BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux kernel 5.1 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to trigger use-after-free conditions to potentially execute code. Sönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-42720` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 5.19.0-23.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 5.19.0-23.24\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 5.19.0-23.24\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.19.0-1010-azure - 5.19.0-1010.11\nNo subscription required",
