		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-1752` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nglibc-source - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlibc-bin - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlibc6 - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlibc6-amd64 - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlibc6-i386 - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlibc6-prof - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlibc6-s390 - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlibc6-x32 - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlocales - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nlocales-all - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nnscd - 2.31-0ubuntu9\nNo subscription required",
