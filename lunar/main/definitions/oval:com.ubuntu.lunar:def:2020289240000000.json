		"Title": "CVE-2020-28924 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Rclone before 1.53.3. Due to the use of a weakrandom number generator, the password generator has been producing weakpasswords with much less entropy than advertised. The suggested passwordsdepend deterministically on the time the second rclone was started. Thislimits the entropy of the passwords enormously. These passwords are oftenused in the crypt backend for encryption of data. It would be possible tomake a dictionary of all possible passwords with about 38 million entriesper password length. This would make decryption of secret material possiblewith a plausible amount of effort. NOTE: all passwords generated byaffected versions should be changed.\n\n    Update Instructions:\n\n    Run `sudo pro fix CVE-2020-28924` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\n    by updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrclone - 1.53.3-1\nNo subscription required",
