		"Title": "CVE-2023-4244 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - high.",
		"Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. Due to a race condition between nf_tables netlink control plane transaction and nft_set element garbage collection, it is possible to underflow the reference counter causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 3e91b0ebd994635df2346353322ac51ce84ce6d8. Bien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-4244` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-35-generic - 6.2.0-35.35\nlinux-image-6.2.0-35-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-35-generic - 6.2.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-35-generic-64k - 6.2.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-aws - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-azure - 6.2.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-gcp - 6.2.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-kvm - 6.2.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1015.15\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-oracle - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1015-raspi - 6.2.0-1015.17\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-35-generic - 6.2.0-35.35\nlinux-image-6.2.0-35-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-35-generic - 6.2.0-35.35\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-35-generic-64k - 6.2.0-35.35\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-aws - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-azure - 6.2.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1017-gcp - 6.2.0-1017.19\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-kvm - 6.2.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1015.15\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1015-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1015.15\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1014-oracle - 6.2.0-1014.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1007-starfive - 6.2.0-1007.8\nNo subscription required",
