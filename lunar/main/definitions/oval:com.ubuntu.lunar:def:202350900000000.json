		"Title": "CVE-2023-5090 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - high.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in KVM. An improper check in svm_set_x2apic_msr_interception() may allow direct access to host x2apic msrs when the guest resets its apic, potentially leading to a denial of service condition. Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash).",
