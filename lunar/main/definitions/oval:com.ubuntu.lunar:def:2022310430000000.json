		"title": "CVE-2022-31043 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - low",
		"description": "Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making arequest using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirectto a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization`header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the headerif the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades didnot result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to thehost. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon aspossible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgradeto Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider analternative approach which would be to use their own redirect middleware.Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirectsare not expected or required.",
