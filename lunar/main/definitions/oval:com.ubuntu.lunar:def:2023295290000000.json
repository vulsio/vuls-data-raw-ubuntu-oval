		"Title": "CVE-2023-29529 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium",
		"Description": "matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript andTypeScript. An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call istaking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants usingmatrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-sdk users,the attacker will not appear to be participating in the call. This attackis possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation acceptsincoming direct calls from other users, even if they have not yet declaredintent to participate in the group call, as a means of resolving a racecondition in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to theuser's outbound media in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. Thisis fixed in matrix-js-sdk 24.1.0. As a workaround, users may hold groupcalls in private rooms where only the exact users who are expected toparticipate in the call are present.",
