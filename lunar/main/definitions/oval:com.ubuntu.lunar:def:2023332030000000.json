    "Title": "CVE-2023-33203 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - low.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel before 6.2.9 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in drivers/net/ethernet/qualcomm/emac/emac.c if a physically proximate attacker unplugs an emac based device. It was discovered that the Qualcomm EMAC ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-33203` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-23-generic - 6.2.0-23.23\nlinux-image-6.2.0-23-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-23-generic - 6.2.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-23-generic-64k - 6.2.0-23.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-aws - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-azure - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1007-gcp - 6.2.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-ibm - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1006-kvm - 6.2.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-oracle - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1006-raspi - 6.2.0-1006.8\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1006-raspi-nolpae - 6.2.0-1006.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-23-generic - 6.2.0-23.23\nlinux-image-6.2.0-23-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-23-generic - 6.2.0-23.23\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-23-generic-64k - 6.2.0-23.23\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-aws - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-azure - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1007-gcp - 6.2.0-1007.7\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1003-ibm - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1006-kvm - 6.2.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1005.5\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1005-oracle - 6.2.0-1005.5\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1002-starfive - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
