		"Description": "A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function l2cap_recv_acldata of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211918 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. It was discovered that the Bluetooth HCI implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. An attacker could possibly use this cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-3619` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.1.0-14.14\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.1.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.1.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.1.0-14.14\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.1.0-14.14\nlinux-image-6.2.0-37-generic-lpae - 6.1.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic - 6.1.0-14.14\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-37-generic-64k - 6.1.0-14.14\nNo subscription required",
