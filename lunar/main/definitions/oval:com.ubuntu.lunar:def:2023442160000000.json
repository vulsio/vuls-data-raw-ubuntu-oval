    "Description": "PVRIC (PowerVR Image Compression) on Imagination 2018 and later GPU devices offers software-transparent compression that enables cross-origin pixel-stealing attacks against feTurbulence and feBlend in the SVG Filter specification, aka a GPU.zip issue. For example, attackers can sometimes accurately determine text contained on a web page from one origin if they control a resource from a different origin.",
