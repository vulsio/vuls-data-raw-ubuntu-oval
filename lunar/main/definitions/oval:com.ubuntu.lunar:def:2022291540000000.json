		"Title": "CVE-2022-29154 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2022-29154` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrsync - 3.2.5\nNo subscription required",
