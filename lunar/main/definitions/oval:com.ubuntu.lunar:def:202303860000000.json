    "Title": "CVE-2023-0386 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - high.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s OverlayFS subsystem in how a user copies a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-0386` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-18-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-6.2.0-18-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-18-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-18-generic-64k - 6.2.0-18.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1004-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-kvm - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1003-raspi - 6.2.0-1003.3\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1003-raspi-nolpae - 6.2.0-1003.3\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-18-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-6.2.0-18-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-18-generic - 6.2.0-18.18\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-18-generic-64k - 6.2.0-18.18\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-aws - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-azure - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1004-gcp - 6.2.0-1004.4\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1001-ibm - 6.2.0-1001.1\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-kvm - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1002.2\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1002-oracle - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1002-starfive - 6.2.0-1002.2\nNo subscription required",
