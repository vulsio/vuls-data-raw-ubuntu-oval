    "Title": "CVE-2023-3269 on Ubuntu 23.04 (lunar) - high.",
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists in the memory management subsystem of the Linux kernel. The lock handling for accessing and updating virtual memory areas (VMAs) is incorrect, leading to use-after-free problems. This issue can be successfully exploited to execute arbitrary kernel code, escalate containers, and gain root privileges. Ruihan Li discovered that the memory management subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition when accessing VMAs in certain conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo pro fix CVE-2023-3269` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic-64k - 6.2.0-26.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-aws - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-gcp - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1006-ibm - 6.2.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-kvm - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1009.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-oracle - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-1009-raspi - 6.2.0-1009.11\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-6.2.0-26-generic-lpae - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic - 6.2.0-26.26\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-26-generic-64k - 6.2.0-26.26\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-aws - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-azure - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1010-gcp - 6.2.0-1010.10\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1006-ibm - 6.2.0-1006.6\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-kvm - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency - 6.2.0-1009.9\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1009-lowlatency-64k - 6.2.0-1009.9\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-6.2.0-1008-oracle - 6.2.0-1008.8\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.19.0-1003-starfive - 5.19.0-1003.4\nNo subscription required",
