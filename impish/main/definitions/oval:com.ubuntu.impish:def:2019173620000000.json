		"Title": "CVE-2019-17362 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data. It was discovered that LibTomCrypt incorrectly handled certain inputs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or read sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-17362` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtomcrypt1 - 1.18.2-3\nNo subscription required",
