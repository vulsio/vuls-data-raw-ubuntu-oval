		"Note": "mdeslaur> should not unserialize untrusted data  CVE-2016-9137 was for the ext/curl/curl_file.c vulnerability that was fixed in the same bug. This CVE is for the remaining security problem associated with __wakeup, which, as far as I can tell is still unfixed as of 2020-06-23 rodrigo-zaiden> As of 2022-02-04, there is still no upstream fix. PHP Bug 73147 is mainly for CVE-2016-9137 and does not have information for a new bug for CVE-2016-9138. Suse has an indication that it might have been fixed along with CVE-2016-7479 patch, but this is not perfectly clear."
