		"Title": "CVE-2017-18264 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in libraries/common.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0 before 4.0.10.20, 4.4.x, 4.6.x, and 4.7.0 prereleases. The restrictions caused by $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false are bypassed under certain PHP versions (e.g., version 5). This can allow the login of users who have no password set even if the administrator has set $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] to false (which is also the default). This occurs because some implementations of the PHP substr function return false when given '' as the first argument.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-18264` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpmyadmin - 4:4.6.6-5\nNo subscription required",
