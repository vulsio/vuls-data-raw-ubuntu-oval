		"description": "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2 before 3.2.4, URLValidator, validate_ipv4_address, and validate_ipv46_address do not prohibit leading zero characters in octal literals. This may allow a bypass of access control that is based on IP addresses. (validate_ipv4_address and validate_ipv46_address are unaffected with Python 3.9.5+..) .\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-33571` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-django - 2:2.2.24-1\nNo subscription required",
