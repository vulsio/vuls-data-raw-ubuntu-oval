Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-12121` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnode72 - 10.15.1~dfsg-5\nnodejs - 10.15.1~dfsg-5\nNo subscription required",
