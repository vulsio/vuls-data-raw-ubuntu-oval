		"title": "CVE-2017-8295 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-8295` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nwordpress - 4.9.5+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-l10n - 4.9.5+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentynineteen - 4.9.5+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwenty - 4.9.5+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwentyone - 4.9.5+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
