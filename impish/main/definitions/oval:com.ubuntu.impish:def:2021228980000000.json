		"Title": "CVE-2021-22898 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"Description": "curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-22898` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.74.0-1.2ubuntu4\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.74.0-1.2ubuntu4\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.74.0-1.2ubuntu4\nlibcurl4 - 7.74.0-1.2ubuntu4\nNo subscription required",
