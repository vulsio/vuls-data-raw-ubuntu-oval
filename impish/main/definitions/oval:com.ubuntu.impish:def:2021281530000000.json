		"Title": "CVE-2021-28153 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-28153` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibglib2.0-0 - 2.68.0-1\nlibglib2.0-bin - 2.68.0-1\nlibglib2.0-data - 2.68.0-1\nlibglib2.0-tests - 2.68.0-1\nNo subscription required",
