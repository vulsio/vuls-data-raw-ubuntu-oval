		"Note": "rodrigo-zaiden> The POC from the SDL issue link only reproduces in versions 2.0.16 and 2.0.18 because of the following commit https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/fed84650 In older versions of libsdl2 and also libsdl1.2, even though the commit above is not present, I think that there might be a slight chance to trick the lib with a special crafted input to cause the heap overflow, and patching will not cause any harm."
