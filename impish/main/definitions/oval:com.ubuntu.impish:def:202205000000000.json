		"Title": "CVE-2022-0500 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in unrestricted eBPF usage by the BPF_BTF_LOAD, leading to a possible out-of-bounds memory write in the Linux kernelâ€™s BPF subsystem due to the way a user loads BTF. This flaw allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent writes to kernel objects in BPF_BTF_LOAD commands. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
