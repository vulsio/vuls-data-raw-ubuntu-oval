		"title": "CVE-2016-7068 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and PowerDNS recursor before 3.7.4 and 4.0.4, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the PowerDNS server by sending crafted DNS queries, which might result in a partial denial of service if the system becomes overloaded. This issue is based on the fact that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage of that behaviour.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-7068` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npdns-backend-bind - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-geoip - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-ldap - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-lmdb - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-lua2 - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-mysql - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-odbc - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-pgsql - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-pipe - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-remote - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-sqlite3 - 4.0.2-1\npdns-backend-tinydns - 4.0.2-1\npdns-ixfrdist - 4.0.2-1\npdns-server - 4.0.2-1\npdns-tools - 4.0.2-1\nNo subscription required\n\npdns-recursor - 4.0.4-1\nNo subscription required",
