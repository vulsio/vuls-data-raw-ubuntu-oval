		"description": "wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.1.0 and earlier (formerly known as CyaSSL) generate biased DSA nonces. This allows a remote attacker to compute the long term private key from several hundred DSA signatures via a lattice attack. The issue occurs because dsa.c fixes two bits of the generated nonces.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-14317` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibwolfssl24 - 4.2.0+dfsg-3\nNo subscription required",
