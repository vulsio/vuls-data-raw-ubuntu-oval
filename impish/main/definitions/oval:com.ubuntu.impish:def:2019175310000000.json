		"Title": "CVE-2019-17531 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0 through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the apache-log4j-extra (version 1.2.x) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can provide a JNDI service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-17531` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjackson2-databind-java - 2.10.1-1\nNo subscription required",
