Zsh fails to overwrite the saved uid, so the original privileges can be restored by executing MODULE_PATH=/dir/with/module zmodload with a module that calls setuid().\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-20044` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nzsh - 5.8-3ubuntu1\nzsh-common - 5.8-3ubuntu1\nzsh-static - 5.8-3ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
