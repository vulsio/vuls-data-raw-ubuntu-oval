		"Title": "CVE-2020-15138 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "Prism is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The easing preview of the Previewers plugin has an XSS vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in Safari and Internet Explorer. This impacts all Safari and Internet Explorer users of Prism >=v1.1.0 that use the _Previewers_ plugin (>=v1.10.0) or the _Previewer: Easing_ plugin (v1.1.0 to v1.9.0). This problem is fixed in version 1.21.0. To workaround the issue without upgrading, disable the easing preview on all impacted code blocks. You need Prism v1.10.0 or newer to apply this workaround.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-15138` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-prismjs - 1.11.0+dfsg-4\nNo subscription required",
