    "Title": "CVE-2019-13173 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "fstream before 1.0.12 is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite. Extracting tarballs containing a hardlink to a file that already exists in the system, and a file that matches the hardlink, will overwrite the system's file with the contents of the extracted file. The fstream.DirWriter() function is vulnerable. It was discovered that npm/fstream incorrectly handled certain crafted tarballs. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write aritrary files to the filesystem.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-13173` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-fstream - 1.0.12-1\nNo subscription required",
