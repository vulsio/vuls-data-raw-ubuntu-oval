		"Title": "CVE-2018-13005 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in MP4Box in GPAC 0.7.1. The function urn_Read in isomedia/box_code_base.c has a heap-based buffer over-read. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-13005` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngpac - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\ngpac-modules-base - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nlibgpac10 - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nNo subscription required",
