		"description": "A heap-based buffer over-read in the getbits function in src/libmpg123/getbits.h in mpg123 through 1.25.5 allows remote attackers to cause a possible denial-of-service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted mp3 file. It was discovered that mpg123 failed to handle certain malformed mp3 files. An attacker could use this vulnerability to potentially leak sensitive information or cause a crash.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-12839` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmpg123-0 - 1.25.10-1\nlibout123-0 - 1.25.10-1\nlibsyn123-0 - 1.25.10-1\nmpg123 - 1.25.10-1\nNo subscription required",
