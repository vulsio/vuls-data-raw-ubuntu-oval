An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary commands.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-9268` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnsis - 2.50-1\nnsis-common - 2.50-1\nnsis-pluginapi - 2.50-1\nNo subscription required",
