		"title": "CVE-2017-9108 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adnshost mishandles a missing final newline on a stdin read. It is wrong to increment used as well as setting r, since used is incremented according to r, later. Rather one should be doing what read() would have done. Without this fix, adnshost may read and process one byte beyond the buffer, perhaps crashing or perhaps somehow leaking the value of that byte.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-9108` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nadns-tools - 1.6.0-2\nlibadns1 - 1.6.0-2\nNo subscription required",
