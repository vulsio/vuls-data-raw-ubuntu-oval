		"Title": "CVE-2019-10141 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "A vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector all versions excluding 5.0.2, 6.0.3, 7.2.4, 8.0.3 and 8.2.1. A SQL-injection vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes a SQL query using unfiltered data from a server reporting inspection results (by a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint). Because the API is unauthenticated, the flaw could be exploited by an attacker with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening. Because of how ironic-inspector uses the query results, it is unlikely that data could be obtained. However, the attacker could pass malicious data and create a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-10141` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nironic-inspector - 8.0.0-3\npython3-ironic-inspector - 8.0.0-3\nNo subscription required",
