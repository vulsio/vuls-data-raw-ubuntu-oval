		"title": "CVE-2021-41229 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"description": "BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-41229` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbluetooth - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nbluez - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nbluez-cups - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nbluez-hcidump - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nbluez-meshd - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nbluez-obexd - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nbluez-tests - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nlibbluetooth3 - 5.60-0ubuntu2.1\nNo subscription required",
