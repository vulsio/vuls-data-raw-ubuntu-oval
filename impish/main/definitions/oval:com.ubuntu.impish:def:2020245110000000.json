    "Title": "CVE-2020-24511 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Joseph Nuzman discovered that some Intel processors may not properly apply EIBRS mitigations (originally developed for CVE-2017-5715) and hence may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-24511` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nintel-microcode - 3.20210608.0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
