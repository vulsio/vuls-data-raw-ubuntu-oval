		"Title": "CVE-2020-25632 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. Chris Coulson discovered that the rmmod command in GRUB 2 contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25632` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.169\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.169\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.04-1ubuntu45\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu45\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.04-1ubuntu45\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu45\nNo subscription required",
