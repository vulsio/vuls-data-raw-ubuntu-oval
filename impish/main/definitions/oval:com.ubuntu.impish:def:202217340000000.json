    "Description": "A flaw in Linux Kernel found in nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev() in drivers/nfc/nfcmrvl/main.c can lead to use after free both read or write when non synchronized between cleanup routine and firmware download routine. It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system) or execute arbitrary code.",
