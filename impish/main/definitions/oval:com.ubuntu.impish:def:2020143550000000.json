		"description": "Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image decoding process of the SPICE remote display system, before spice-0.14.2-1. Both the SPICE client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by these flaws.

The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibspice-server1 - 0.14.3-1ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
