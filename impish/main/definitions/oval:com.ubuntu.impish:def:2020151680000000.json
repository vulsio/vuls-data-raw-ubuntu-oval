		"title": "CVE-2020-15168 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"description": "node-fetch before versions 2.6.1 and 3.0.0-beta.9 did not honor the size option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a FetchError would never get thrown and the process would end without failure. For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-15168` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-fetch - 2.6.1-3\nNo subscription required",
