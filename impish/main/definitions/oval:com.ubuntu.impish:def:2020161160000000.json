    "Description": "In kerfuffle/jobs.cpp in KDE Ark before 20.08.0, a crafted archive can install files outside the extraction directory via ../ directory traversal. Dominik Penner discovered that Ark did not properly sanitize zip archive files before performing extraction. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious zip archive that, when opened, would create files outside the extraction directory.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-16116` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nark - 4:20.04.3-1\nNo subscription required",
