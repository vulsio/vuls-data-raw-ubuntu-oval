		"Title": "CVE-2019-16255 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows code injection if the first argument (aka the \"command\" argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method. It was discovered that JRuby did not properly sanitize input to Shell#[] and its alias Shell#test. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands.",
