		"title": "CVE-2019-7283 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in rcp in NetKit through 0.17. For an rcp operation, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client machine. This is similar to CVE-2019-6111.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-7283` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrsh-client - 0.17-21\nrsh-server - 0.17-21\nNo subscription required",
