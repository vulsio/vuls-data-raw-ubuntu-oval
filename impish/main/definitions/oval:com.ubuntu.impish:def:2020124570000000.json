    "Description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.5.0. It mishandles the change_cipher_spec (CCS) message processing logic for TLS 1.3. If an attacker sends ChangeCipherSpec messages in a crafted way involving more than one in a row, the server becomes stuck in the ProcessReply() loop, i.e., a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-12457` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibwolfssl24 - 4.5.0+dfsg-2\nNo subscription required",
