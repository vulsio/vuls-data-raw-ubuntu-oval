In a situation where access to user registration was unrestricted, this provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-45115` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-django - 2:2.2.24-1ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
