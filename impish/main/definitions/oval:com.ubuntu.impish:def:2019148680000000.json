    "Description": "In ksh version 20120801, a flaw was found in the way it evaluates certain environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands.

It was discovered that Korn Shell incorrectly handled environment variables. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-14868` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nksh - 2020.0.0-5\nNo subscription required",
