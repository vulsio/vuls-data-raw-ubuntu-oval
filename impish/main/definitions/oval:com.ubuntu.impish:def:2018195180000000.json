    "Title": "CVE-2018-19518 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2007f on UNIX, as used in imap_open() in PHP and other products, launches an rsh command (by means of the imap_rimap function in c-client/imap4r1.c and the tcp_aopen function in osdep/unix/tcp_unix.c) without preventing argument injection, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands if the IMAP server name is untrusted input (e.g., entered by a user of a web application) and if rsh has been replaced by a program with different argument semantics. For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen on Debian and Ubuntu systems), then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing a \"-oProxyCommand\" argument. It was discovered that UW IMAP incorrectly handled inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary OS commands.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-19518` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibc-client2007e - 8:2007f~dfsg-6\nmlock - 8:2007f~dfsg-6\nuw-mailutils - 8:2007f~dfsg-6\nNo subscription required",
