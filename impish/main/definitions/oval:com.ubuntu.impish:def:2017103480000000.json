		"Title": "CVE-2017-10348 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151, 8u144 and 9; Java SE Embedded: 8u144. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not properly limit the amount of memory allocated when performing deserializations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-10348` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u151-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u151-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u151-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u151-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u151-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u151-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u151-b12-1\nNo subscription required",
