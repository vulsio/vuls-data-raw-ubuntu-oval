    "Description": "A flaw was found in GDM in versions prior to 3.38.2.1. A race condition in the handling of session shutdown makes it possible to bypass the lock screen for a user that has autologin enabled, accessing their session without authentication. This is similar to CVE-2017-12164, but requires more difficult conditions to exploit.",
