    "Title": "CVE-2017-7525 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind, versions before 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1 and 2.8.9, which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7525` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjackson2-databind-java - 2.9.1-1\nNo subscription required\n\nlibjackson-json-java - 1.9.13-2\nNo subscription required",
