    "Title": "CVE-2019-17455 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "Libntlm through 1.5 relies on a fixed buffer size for tSmbNtlmAuthRequest, tSmbNtlmAuthChallenge, and tSmbNtlmAuthResponse read and write operations, as demonstrated by a stack-based buffer over-read in buildSmbNtlmAuthRequest in smbutil.c for a crafted NTLM request. It was discovered that Libntlm incorrectly handled specially crafted NTML requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or another unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-17455` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibntlm0 - 1.6-1\nNo subscription required",
