		"title": "CVE-2020-5216 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection vulnerability is present in versions before 3.9.0, 5.2.0, and 6.3.0. If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a newline could be injected leading to limited header injection. Upon seeing a newline in the header, rails will silently create a new Content-Security-Policy header with the remaining value of the original string. It will continue to create new headers for each newline. This has been fixed in 6.3.0, 5.2.0, and 3.9.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-5216` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-secure-headers - 6.3.1-1\nNo subscription required",
