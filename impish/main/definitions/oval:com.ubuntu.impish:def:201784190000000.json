		"Title": "CVE-2017-8419 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "LAME through 3.99.5 relies on the signed integer data type for values in a WAV or AIFF header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow or heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by mishandling of num_channels. It was discovered that LAME incorrectly handled certain audio files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-8419` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlame - 3.100-2\nlibmp3lame0 - 3.100-2\nNo subscription required",
