		"Title": "CVE-2021-21274 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-21274` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmatrix-synapse - 1.26.0-3\nNo subscription required",
