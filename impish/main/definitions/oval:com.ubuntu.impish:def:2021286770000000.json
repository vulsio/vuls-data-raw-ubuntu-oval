		"title": "CVE-2021-28677 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the readline implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any combination of \\r and \\n as line endings. It used an accidentally quadratic method of accumulating lines while looking for a line ending. A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-28677` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-pil - 8.1.2+dfsg-0.1ubuntu1\npython3-pil.imagetk - 8.1.2+dfsg-0.1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
