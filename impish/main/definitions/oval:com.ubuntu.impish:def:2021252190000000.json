		"title": "CVE-2021-25219 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "In BIND 9.3.0 -> 9.11.35, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.21, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.35-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.21-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.18 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, exploitation of broken authoritative servers using a flaw in response processing can cause degradation in BIND resolver performance. The way the lame cache is currently designed makes it possible for its internal data structures to grow almost infinitely, which may cause significant delays in client query processing.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-25219` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbind9 - 1:9.16.15-1ubuntu1.1\nbind9-dnsutils - 1:9.16.15-1ubuntu1.1\nbind9-host - 1:9.16.15-1ubuntu1.1\nbind9-libs - 1:9.16.15-1ubuntu1.1\nbind9-utils - 1:9.16.15-1ubuntu1.1\nbind9utils - 1:9.16.15-1ubuntu1.1\ndnsutils - 1:9.16.15-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
