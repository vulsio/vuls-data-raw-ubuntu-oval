However, there is an unspecified attack methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory consumption.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-28651` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 4.13-10ubuntu1\nsquid-cgi - 4.13-10ubuntu1\nsquid-common - 4.13-10ubuntu1\nsquid-openssl - 4.13-10ubuntu1\nsquid-purge - 4.13-10ubuntu1\nsquidclient - 4.13-10ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
