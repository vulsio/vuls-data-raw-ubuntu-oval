		"Title": "CVE-2019-16056 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16056` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nidle-python2.7 - 2.7.17~rc1-1\nlibpython2.7 - 2.7.17~rc1-1\nlibpython2.7-minimal - 2.7.17~rc1-1\nlibpython2.7-stdlib - 2.7.17~rc1-1\nlibpython2.7-testsuite - 2.7.17~rc1-1\npython2.7 - 2.7.17~rc1-1\npython2.7-examples - 2.7.17~rc1-1\npython2.7-minimal - 2.7.17~rc1-1\nNo subscription required",

	"notes": {
		"Note": "seth-arnold> This has a very high risk of regression. Email addresses should not be validated beyond making sure there's at least one byte on both sides of an '@' sign. Legal email addresses are significantly more complicated than what is easy to express in regex. Whatever validation this module provides is in my opinion suspect."
