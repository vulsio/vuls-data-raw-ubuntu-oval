		"Title": "CVE-2022-0854 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"Description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space. It was discovered that the DMA subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly ensure bounce buffers were completely overwritten by the DMA device. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
