		"title": "CVE-2022-1348 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "A vulnerability was found in logrotate in how the state file is created. The state file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances of logrotate by acquiring and releasing a file lock. When the state file does not exist, it is created with world-readable permission, allowing an unprivileged user to lock the state file, stopping any rotation. This flaw affects logrotate versions before 3.20.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2022-1348` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlogrotate - 3.18.0-2ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
