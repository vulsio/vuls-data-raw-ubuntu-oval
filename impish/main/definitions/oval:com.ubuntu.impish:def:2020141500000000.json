		"description": "GNU Bison before 3.5.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash). NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and an observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug reports were intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-14150` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbison - 2:3.6.1+dfsg-2\nNo subscription required",
