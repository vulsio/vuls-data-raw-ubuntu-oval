		"title": "CVE-2018-20763 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "In GPAC 0.7.1 and earlier, gf_text_get_utf8_line in media_tools/text_import.c in libgpac_static.a allows an out-of-bounds write because of missing szLineConv bounds checking. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-20763` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngpac - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\ngpac-modules-base - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nlibgpac10 - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nNo subscription required",
