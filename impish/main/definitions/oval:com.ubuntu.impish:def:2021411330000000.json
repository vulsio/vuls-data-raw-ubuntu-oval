    "Title": "CVE-2021-41133 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely. Flatpak apps that act as clients for AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has. Note that protocols that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are not affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses. Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, and as of time of publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-41133` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nflatpak - 1.10.2-3ubuntu0.1\nflatpak-tests - 1.10.2-3ubuntu0.1\ngir1.2-flatpak-1.0 - 1.10.2-3ubuntu0.1\nlibflatpak0 - 1.10.2-3ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
