    "Title": "CVE-2017-7500 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "It was found that rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a destination path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing ownership and permissions of an arbitrary directory, and RPM files being placed in an arbitrary destination. An attacker, with write access to a directory in which a subdirectory will be installed, could redirect that directory to an arbitrary location and gain root privilege.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7500` to fix the vulnerability.
