		"title": "CVE-2017-2292 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents without calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-2292` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmcollective - 2.12.1+dfsg-1\nmcollective-client - 2.12.1+dfsg-1\nmcollective-common - 2.12.1+dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
