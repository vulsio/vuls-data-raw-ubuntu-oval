		"description": "Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in http/cervlet.c in Tildeslash Monit before 5.25.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript via manipulation of an unsanitized user field of the Authorization header for HTTP Basic Authentication, which is mishandled during an _viewlog operation. Zack Flack discovered that Monit incorrectly handled certain input. A remote authenticated user could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-11454` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmonit - 1:5.25.3-1\nNo subscription required",
