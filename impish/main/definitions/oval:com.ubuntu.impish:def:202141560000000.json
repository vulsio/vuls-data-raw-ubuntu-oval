    "Title": "CVE-2021-4156 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in libsndfile's FLAC codec functionality. An attacker who is able to submit a specially crafted file (via tricking a user to open or otherwise) to an application linked with libsndfile and using the FLAC codec, could trigger an out-of-bounds read that would most likely cause a crash but could potentially leak memory information that could be used in further exploitation of other flaws.",
