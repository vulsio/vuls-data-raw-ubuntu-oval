    "Title": "CVE-2019-6111 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-6111` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:7.9p1-10\nopenssh-server - 1:7.9p1-10\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:7.9p1-10\nopenssh-tests - 1:7.9p1-10\nssh - 1:7.9p1-10\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:7.9p1-10\nNo subscription required",

    "Note": "seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using sftp instead of scp.  The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.  The initial USN was incomplete and did not include the second commit."
