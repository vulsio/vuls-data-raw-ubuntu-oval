		"Title": "CVE-2018-18584 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "In mspack/cab.h in libmspack before 0.8alpha and cabextract before 1.8, the CAB block input buffer is one byte too small for the maximal Quantum block, leading to an out-of-bounds write. It was discovered that cabextract incorrectly handled certain malformed CAB files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause cabextract to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-18584` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmspack0 - 0.9.1-1\nNo subscription required",
