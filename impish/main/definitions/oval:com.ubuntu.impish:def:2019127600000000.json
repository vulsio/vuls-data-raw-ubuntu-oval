		"Description": "** DISPUTED ** A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso through 0.4.0 handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies on pickle and, provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache grammar file and that its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This is disputed because \"the cache directory is not under control of the attacker in any common configuration.\"\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12760` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-parso - 0.5.1-0.1\nNo subscription required",
