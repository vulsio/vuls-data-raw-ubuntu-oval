		"Title": "CVE-2012-6707 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"Description": "WordPress through 4.8.2 uses a weak MD5-based password hashing algorithm, which makes it easier for attackers to determine cleartext values by leveraging access to the hash values. NOTE: the approach to changing this may not be fully compatible with certain use cases, such as migration of a WordPress site from a web host that uses a recent PHP version to a different web host that uses PHP 5.2. These use cases are plausible (but very unlikely) based on statistics showing widespread deployment of WordPress with obsolete PHP versions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2012-6707` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nwordpress - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-l10n - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentynineteen - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwenty - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwentyone - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
