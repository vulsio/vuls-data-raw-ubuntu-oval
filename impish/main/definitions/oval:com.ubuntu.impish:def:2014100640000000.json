		"Description": "The qs module before 1.0.0 does not have an option or default for specifying object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will block the event loop for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be processed while this blocking is occurring.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2014-10064` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-qs - 2.2.4-1\nNo subscription required",
