		"Title": "CVE-2019-16884 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "runc through 1.0.0-rc8, as used in Docker through 19.03.2-ce and other products, allows AppArmor restriction bypass because libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go incorrectly checks mount targets, and thus a malicious Docker image can mount over a /proc directory. It was discovered that runC incorrectly implemented AppArmor restrictions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to mount malicious images.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16884` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nrunc - 1.0.0~rc8+git20190923.3e425f80-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
