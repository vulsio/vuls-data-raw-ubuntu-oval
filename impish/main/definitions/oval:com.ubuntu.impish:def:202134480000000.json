		"title": "CVE-2021-3448 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-3448` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.85-1ubuntu1\ndnsmasq-base - 2.85-1ubuntu1\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.85-1ubuntu1\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.85-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
