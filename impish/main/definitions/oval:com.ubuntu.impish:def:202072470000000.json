    "Title": "CVE-2020-7247 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - high.",
    "Description": "smtp_mailaddr in smtp_session.c in OpenSMTPD 6.6, as used in OpenBSD 6.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root via a crafted SMTP session, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in a MAIL FROM field. This affects the \"uncommented\" default configuration. The issue exists because of an incorrect return value upon failure of input validation. It was discovered that OpenSMTPD incorrectly verified the sender's or receiver's e-mail addresses under certain conditions. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands as root.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-7247` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopensmtpd - 6.6.2p1-1\nNo subscription required",
