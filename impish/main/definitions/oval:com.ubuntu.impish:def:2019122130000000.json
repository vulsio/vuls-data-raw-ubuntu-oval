    "Title": "CVE-2019-12213 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "When FreeImage 3.18.0 reads a special TIFF file, the TIFFReadDirectory function in PluginTIFF.cpp always returns 1, leading to stack exhaustion. It was discovered that FreeImage incorrectly processed images under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted TIFF file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a stack exhaustion condition, resulting in a denial of service attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12213` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibfreeimage3 - 3.18.0+ds2-6ubuntu1\nlibfreeimageplus3 - 3.18.0+ds2-6ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
