		"title": "CVE-2020-25829 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.1.18, 4.2.x before 4.2.5, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. A remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the Bogus DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC Secure state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service for installation that always validate (dnssec=validate), and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25829` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npdns-recursor - 4.3.5-1\nNo subscription required",
