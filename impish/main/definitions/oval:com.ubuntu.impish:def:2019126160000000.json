		"title": "CVE-2019-12616 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.9.0. A vulnerability was found that allows an attacker to trigger a CSRF attack against a phpMyAdmin user. The attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken <img> tag pointing at the victim's phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can potentially deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE statement) to the victim. It was discovered that phpMyAdmin incorrectly handled some requests. An attacker could possibly use this to perform a CSRF attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12616` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpmyadmin - 4:4.9.2+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
