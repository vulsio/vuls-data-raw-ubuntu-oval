		"Title": "CVE-2021-26910 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "Firejail before 0.9.64.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions because there is a TOCTOU race condition between a stat operation and an OverlayFS mount operation. Roman Fiedler discovered that a race condition existed in Firejail when using OverlayFS to prevent writes to the underlying file system. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. Note: this update disables support for OverlayFS in Firejail.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-26910` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirejail - 0.9.64.4-1\nfirejail-profiles - 0.9.64.4-1\nNo subscription required",
