A carefully crafted JSON schema could be provided that allows execution of other code by prototype pollution. (While untrusted schemas are recommended against, the worst case of an untrusted schema should be a denial of service, not execution of code.)\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-15366` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-ajv - 6.12.4-1\nNo subscription required",
