		"description": "The Elliptic package 6.5.2 for Node.js allows ECDSA signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading '\\0' bytes, or integer overflows. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-13822` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-elliptic - 6.5.3~dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
