		"title": "CVE-2022-32206 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "curl < 7.84.0 supports \"chained\" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a serverresponse can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.The use of such a decompression chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", makingcurl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying toand returning out of memory errors.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2022-32206` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.74.0-1.3ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.74.0-1.3ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.74.0-1.3ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl4 - 7.74.0-1.3ubuntu2.3\nNo subscription required",
