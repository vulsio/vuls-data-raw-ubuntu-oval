    "Description": "In ioquake3 before 2017-03-14, the auto-downloading feature has insufficient content restrictions. This also affects Quake III Arena, OpenArena, OpenJK, iortcw, and other id Tech 3 (aka Quake 3 engine) forks. A malicious auto-downloaded file can trigger loading of crafted auto-downloaded files as native code DLLs. A malicious auto-downloaded file can contain configuration defaults that override the user's. Executable bytecode in a malicious auto-downloaded file can set configuration variables to values that will result in unwanted native code DLLs being loaded, resulting in sandbox escape.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-6903` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nioquake3 - 1.36+u20180108~dfsg-2\nioquake3-server - 1.36+u20180108~dfsg-2\nNo subscription required",
