		"description": "A flaw was found in postgresql. A purpose-crafted query can read arbitrary bytes of server memory. In the default configuration, any authenticated database user can complete this attack at will. The attack does not require the ability to create objects. If server settings include max_worker_processes=0, the known versions of this attack are infeasible. However, undiscovered variants of the attack may be independent of that setting.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-3677` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibecpg-compat3 - 13.4-1\nlibecpg6 - 13.4-1\nlibpgtypes3 - 13.4-1\nlibpq5 - 13.4-1\npostgresql-13 - 13.4-1\npostgresql-client-13 - 13.4-1\npostgresql-plperl-13 - 13.4-1\npostgresql-plpython3-13 - 13.4-1\npostgresql-pltcl-13 - 13.4-1\nNo subscription required",
