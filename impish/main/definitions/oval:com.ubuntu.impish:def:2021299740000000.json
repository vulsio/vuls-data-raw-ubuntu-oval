		"Title": "CVE-2021-29974 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 90.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-29974` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 90.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 90.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 90.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
