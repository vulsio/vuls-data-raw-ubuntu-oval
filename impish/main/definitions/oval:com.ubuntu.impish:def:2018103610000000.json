		"title": "CVE-2018-10361 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in KTextEditor 5.34.0 through 5.45.0. Insecure handling of temporary files in the KTextEditor's kauth_ktexteditor_helper service (as utilized in the Kate text editor) can allow other unprivileged users on the local system to gain root privileges. The attack occurs when one user (who has an unprivileged account but is also able to authenticate as root) writes a text file using Kate into a directory owned by a another unprivileged user. The latter unprivileged user conducts a symlink attack to achieve privilege escalation.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-10361` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nktexteditor-data - 5.62.0\nktexteditor-katepart - 5.62.0\nlibkf5texteditor-bin - 5.62.0\nlibkf5texteditor5 - 5.62.0\nNo subscription required",
