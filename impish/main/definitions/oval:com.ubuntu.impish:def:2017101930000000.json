		"Title": "CVE-2017-10193 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131; Java SE Embedded: 8u131. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict weak key sizes in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-10193` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u141-b15-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u141-b15-1\nNo subscription required",
