		"title": "CVE-2021-21419 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-21419` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-eventlet - 0.30.0-0ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
