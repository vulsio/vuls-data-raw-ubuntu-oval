	"notes": {
		"Note": "seth-arnold> Actually addressing this will likely require every site that is using these password storage formats to make plans for an orderly transition to argon2 or scrypt or similar before making configuration changes. We may mark all of these packages as 'ignored' without any further work. rodrigo-zaiden> Despite the risks of applying any changes, there are no clues that glibc upstream will get this fixed. But just to make sure, before marking as ignored, I will mark as deferred as of 2022-06-01 so we can revisit it in the future."
