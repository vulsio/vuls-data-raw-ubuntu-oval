    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Botan 1.11.32 through 2.x before 2.6.0. An off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext could cause the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer, aka an over-read. The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This could be used for denial of service. No information leak occurs.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-9860` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbotan - 2.9.0-2\nlibbotan-2-17 - 2.9.0-2\npython3-botan - 2.9.0-2\nNo subscription required",
