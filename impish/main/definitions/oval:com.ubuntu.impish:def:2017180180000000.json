The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncoreutils - 8.32-4ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",

		"note": "ccdm94> It seems like this will not be fixed upstream (due to the nature of the chown and chgrp utilities), the available patch being a documentation change to warn users about insecure software behavior when certain options are used together in chown and chgrp. For this reason, we will not be fixing this issue in releases where it would be needed. These will be marked as ignored."
