    "Title": "CVE-2018-12895 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which is passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-12895` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nwordpress - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-l10n - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentynineteen - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwenty - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwentyone - 4.9.7+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
