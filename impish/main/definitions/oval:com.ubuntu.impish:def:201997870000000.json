    "Description": "WordPress before 5.1.1 does not properly filter comment content, leading to Remote Code Execution by unauthenticated users in a default configuration. This occurs because CSRF protection is mishandled, and because Search Engine Optimization of A elements is performed incorrectly, leading to XSS. The XSS results in administrative access, which allows arbitrary changes to .php files. This is related to wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php and wp-includes/comment.php.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-9787` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nwordpress - 5.1.1+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-l10n - 5.1.1+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentynineteen - 5.1.1+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwenty - 5.1.1+dfsg1-1\nwordpress-theme-twentytwentyone - 5.1.1+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
