		"Title": "CVE-2019-16786 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"Description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and only look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would fall through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16786` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-waitress - 1.4.1-1\nNo subscription required",
