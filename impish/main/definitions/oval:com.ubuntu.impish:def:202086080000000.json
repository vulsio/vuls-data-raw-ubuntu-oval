		"title": "CVE-2020-8608 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "In libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, tcp_subr.c misuses snprintf return values, leading to a buffer overflow in later code. It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator misuses snprintf return values. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-8608` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibslirp0 - 4.1.0-2ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nslirp4netns - 1.0.1-1\nNo subscription required",
