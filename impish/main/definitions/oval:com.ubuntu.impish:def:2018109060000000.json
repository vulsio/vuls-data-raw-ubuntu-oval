		"title": "CVE-2018-10906 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"description": "In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-10906` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfuse - 2.9.9-5ubuntu1\nlibfuse2 - 2.9.9-5ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nfuse3 - 3.10.3-1\nlibfuse3-3 - 3.10.3-1\nNo subscription required",
