    "Title": "CVE-2019-13283 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "In Xpdf 4.01.01, a heap-based buffer over-read could be triggered in strncpy from FoFiType1::parse in fofi/FoFiType1.cc because it does not ensure the source string has a valid length before making a fixed-length copy. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftotext tool. It allows an attacker to use a crafted pdf file to cause Denial of Service or an information leak, or possibly have unspecified other impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-13283` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-poppler-0.18 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu4\nlibpoppler-cpp0v5 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu4\nlibpoppler-glib8 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu4\nlibpoppler-qt5-1 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu4\nlibpoppler111 - 0.76.1-0ubuntu4\npoppler-utils - 0.76.1-0ubuntu4\nNo subscription required",
