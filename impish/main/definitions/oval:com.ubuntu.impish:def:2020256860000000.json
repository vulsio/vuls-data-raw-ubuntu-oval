    "Title": "CVE-2020-25686 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query, dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network to substantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to perform to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the \"Birthday Attacks\" section of RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25686` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.82-1ubuntu2\ndnsmasq-base - 2.82-1ubuntu2\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.82-1ubuntu2\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.82-1ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
