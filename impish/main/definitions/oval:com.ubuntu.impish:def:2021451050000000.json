    "Title": "CVE-2021-45105 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 (excluding 2.12.3 and 2.3.1) did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed in Log4j 2.17.0, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-45105` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblog4j2-java - 2.17.0-0.21.10.1\nNo subscription required",
