    "Title": "CVE-2022-2380 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel was found vulnerable out of bounds memory access in the drivers/video/fbdev/sm712fb.c:smtcfb_read() function. The vulnerability could result in local attackers being able to crash the kernel. Zheyu Ma discovered that the Silicon Motion SM712 framebuffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle very small reads. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
