		"title": "CVE-2016-6830 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "The \"process-execute\" and \"process-spawn\" procedures in CHICKEN Scheme used fixed-size buffers for holding the arguments and environment variables to use in its execve() call. This would allow user-supplied argument/environment variable lists to trigger a buffer overrun. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-6830` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nchicken-bin - 4.12.0-0.1\nlibchicken11 - 4.12.0-0.1\nNo subscription required",
