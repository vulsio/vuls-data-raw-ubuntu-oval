    "Title": "CVE-2020-10803 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5 and 5.x before 5.0.2, a SQL injection vulnerability was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results (in tbl_get_field.php and libraries/classes/Display/Results.php). The attacker must be able to insert crafted data into certain database tables, which when retrieved (for instance, through the Browse tab) can trigger the XSS attack. It was discovered that phpMyAdmin did not properly handle data from the database when displaying it. If an attacker were to insert specially-crafted data into certain database tables, the attacker could execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-10803` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpmyadmin - 4:4.9.5+dfsg1-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
