    "Description": "The III_i_stereo function in libmpg123/layer3.c in mpg123 through 1.25.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted audio file that is mishandled in the code for the \"block_type != 2\" case, a similar issue to CVE-2017-9870. It was discovered that mpg123 incorrectly handled certain media files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-11126` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmpg123-0 - 1.25.8-1\nlibout123-0 - 1.25.8-1\nlibsyn123-0 - 1.25.8-1\nmpg123 - 1.25.8-1\nNo subscription required",
