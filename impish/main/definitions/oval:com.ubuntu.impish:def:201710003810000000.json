		"Title": "CVE-2017-1000381 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "The c-ares function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`, which is used for parsing NAPTR responses, could be triggered to read memory outside of the given input buffer if the passed in DNS response packet was crafted in a particular way. It was discovered that c-ares incorrectly handled certain NAPTR responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause applications using c-ares to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-1000381` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibc-ares2 - 1.12.0-4\nNo subscription required\n\nlibnode72 - 8.1.4\nnodejs - 8.1.4\nNo subscription required",
