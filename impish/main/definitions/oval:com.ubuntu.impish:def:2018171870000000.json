		"title": "CVE-2018-17187 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer to perform TLS, enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless a verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate, with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed. The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted, leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses of the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport TLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enable hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later and utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the default for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-17187` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibqpid-proton-cpp12 - 0.22.0-3.2\nlibqpid-proton11 - 0.22.0-3.2\npython3-qpid-proton - 0.22.0-3.2\nNo subscription required",
