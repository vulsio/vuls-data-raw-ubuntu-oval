    "Title": "CVE-2019-12209 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and does not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other files on the system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the PAM configuration, part of the file contents of a symlink target will be logged, possibly revealing sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12209` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibpam-u2f - 1.0.8-1\npamu2fcfg - 1.0.8-1\nNo subscription required",
