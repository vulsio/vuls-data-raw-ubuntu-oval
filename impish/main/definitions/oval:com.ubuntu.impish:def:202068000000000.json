    "Title": "CVE-2020-6800 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72 and Firefox ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and Firefox < ESR68.5.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-6800` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 73.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 73.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 73.0+build3-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nthunderbird - 1:68.5.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-gnome-support - 1:68.5.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nthunderbird-mozsymbols - 1:68.5.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-calendar-timezones - 1:68.5.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-gdata-provider - 1:68.5.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nxul-ext-lightning - 1:68.5.0+build1-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
