    "Title": "CVE-2019-12211 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "When FreeImage 3.18.0 reads a tiff file, it will be handed to the Load function of the PluginTIFF.cpp file, but a memcpy occurs in which the destination address and the size of the copied data are not considered, resulting in a heap overflow. It was discovered that FreeImage incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted TIFF file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12211` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibfreeimage3 - 3.18.0+ds2-6ubuntu1\nlibfreeimageplus3 - 3.18.0+ds2-6ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
