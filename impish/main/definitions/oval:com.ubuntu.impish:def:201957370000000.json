    "Title": "CVE-2019-5737 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "In Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly. This keeps the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1. Marco Pracucci discovered that Node.js mishandled HTTP and HTTPS connections. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-5737` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnode72 - 10.15.2~dfsg-1\nnodejs - 10.15.2~dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
