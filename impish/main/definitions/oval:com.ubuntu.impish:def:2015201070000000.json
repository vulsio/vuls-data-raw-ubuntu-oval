    "Title": "CVE-2015-20107 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "In Python (aka CPython) through 3.10.4, the mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to inject shell commands into applications that call mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of user-provided filenames or arguments).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-20107` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nidle-python2.7 - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\nlibpython2.7 - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\nlibpython2.7-minimal - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\nlibpython2.7-stdlib - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\nlibpython2.7-testsuite - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\npython2.7 - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\npython2.7-examples - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\npython2.7-minimal - 2.7.18-8ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required\n\nidle-python3.9 - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\nlibpython3.9 - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\nlibpython3.9-minimal - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\nlibpython3.9-stdlib - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\nlibpython3.9-testsuite - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\npython3.9 - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\npython3.9-examples - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\npython3.9-full - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\npython3.9-minimal - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\npython3.9-venv - 3.9.7-2ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
