		"Title": "CVE-2020-26979 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"Description": "When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-26979` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 84.0+build3-0ubuntu2\nfirefox-geckodriver - 84.0+build3-0ubuntu2\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 84.0+build3-0ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
