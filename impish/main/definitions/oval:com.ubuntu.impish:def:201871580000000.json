    "Title": "CVE-2018-7158 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "The `'path'` module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-7158` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnode72 - 8.10.0~dfsg-2\nnodejs - 8.10.0~dfsg-2\nNo subscription required",
