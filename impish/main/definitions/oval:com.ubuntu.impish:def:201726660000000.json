    "Description": "It was discovered in Undertow that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-2666` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibundertow-java - 1.4.18-1\nNo subscription required",
