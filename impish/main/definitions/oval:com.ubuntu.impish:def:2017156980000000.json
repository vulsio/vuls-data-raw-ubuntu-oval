		"Title": "CVE-2017-15698 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"Description": "When parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate, Apache Tomcat Native Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle fields longer than 127 bytes. The result of the parsing error was to skip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible for client certificates that should have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-15698` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtcnative-1 - 1.2.16-1\nNo subscription required",
