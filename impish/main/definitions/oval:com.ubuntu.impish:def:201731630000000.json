    "Title": "CVE-2017-3163 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull index files from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However, Solr before 5.5.4 and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users would gain direct HTTP access. Hrishikesh Gadre discovered that Apache Solr did not validate the file name, hence an attacker could possible to craft a special request involving path traversal that could made it crash and provoke a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-3163` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nliblucene3-contrib-java - 3.6.2+dfsg-11\nliblucene3-java - 3.6.2+dfsg-11\nNo subscription required",
