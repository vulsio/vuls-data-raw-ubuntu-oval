		"title": "CVE-2018-14938 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue was discovered in wifipcap/wifipcap.cpp in TCPFLOW through 1.5.0-alpha. There is an integer overflow in the function handle_prism during caplen processing. If the caplen is less than 144, one can cause an integer overflow in the function handle_80211, which will result in an out-of-bounds read and may allow access to sensitive memory (or a denial of service). It was discovered that tcpflow mishandled certain crafted input, resulting in an integer overflow. An attacker could use this vulnerability to leak sensitive information or cause a denial of service (crash).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-14938` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ntcpflow - 1.5.2+repack1-1\ntcpflow-nox - 1.5.2+repack1-1\nNo subscription required",
