An attacker could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive information via timing side-channel attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-9735` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njetty9 - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-extra-java - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-java - 9.2.26-1\nNo subscription required",
