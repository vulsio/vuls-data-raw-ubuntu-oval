    "Title": "CVE-2021-29458 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as insert. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-29458` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nexiv2 - 0.27.3-3ubuntu2\nlibexiv2-27 - 0.27.3-3ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
