    "Title": "CVE-2021-20235 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "There's a flaw in the zeromq server in versions before 4.3.3 in src/decoder_allocators.hpp. The decoder static allocator could have its sized changed, but the buffer would remain the same as it is a static buffer. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-20235` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibzmq5 - 4.3.4-1\nNo subscription required",
