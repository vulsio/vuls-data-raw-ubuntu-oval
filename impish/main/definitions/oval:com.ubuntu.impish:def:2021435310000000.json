    "Title": "CVE-2021-43531 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "When a user loaded a Web Extensions context menu, the Web Extension could access the post-redirect URL of the element clicked. If the Web Extension lacked the WebRequest permission for the hosts involved in the redirect, this would be a same-origin-violation leaking data the Web Extension should have access to. This was fixed to provide the pre-redirect URL. This is related to CVE-2021-43532 but in the context of Web Extensions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-43531` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu0.21.10.1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu0.21.10.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 94.0+build3-0ubuntu0.21.10.1\nNo subscription required",
