		"title": "CVE-2016-7069 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
		"description": "An issue has been found in dnsdist before 1.2.0 in the way EDNS0 OPT records are handled when parsing responses from a backend. When dnsdist is configured to add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding the response to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing the received response to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to a crash.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-7069` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsdist - 1.2.0-1\nNo subscription required",
