		"description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JCE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151; JRockit: R28.3.16. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.9 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). It was discovered that the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) implementation in OpenJDK in some situations did guarantee sufficient strength of keys during key agreement. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-2618` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u162-b12-1\nNo subscription required",
