    "Title": "CVE-2018-19046 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
    "Description": "keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for existing plain files when writing data to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. If a local attacker had previously created a file with the expected name (e.g., /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats), with read access for the attacker and write access for the keepalived process, then this potentially leaked sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-19046` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nkeepalived - 1:2.0.10-1\nNo subscription required",
