		"title": "CVE-2019-16792 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16792` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-waitress - 1.4.1-1\nNo subscription required",
