    "Title": "CVE-2020-5217 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
    "Description": "In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection vulnerability is present in versions before 3.8.0, 5.1.0, and 6.2.0. If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could be injected leading to directive injection. This could be used to e.g. override a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and the first one wins. The directives in secure_headers are sorted alphabetically so they pretty much all come before script-src. A previously undefined directive would receive a value even if SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT was supplied. The fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s. Depending on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-5217` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-secure-headers - 6.3.1-1\nNo subscription required",
