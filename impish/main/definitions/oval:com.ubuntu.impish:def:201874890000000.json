    "Title": "CVE-2018-7489 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - high.",
    "Description": "FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.7.9.3, 2.8.x before 2.8.11.1 and 2.9.x before 2.9.5 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the c3p0 libraries are available in the classpath. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-7489` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjackson2-databind-java - 2.9.5-1\nNo subscription required",
