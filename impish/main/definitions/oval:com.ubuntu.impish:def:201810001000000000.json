		"description": "GPAC MP4Box version 0.7.1 and earlier contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in src/isomedia/avc_ext.c lines 2417 to 2420 that can result in Heap chunks being modified, this could lead to RCE. This attack appear to be exploitable via an attacker supplied MP4 file that when run by the victim may result in RCE. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
