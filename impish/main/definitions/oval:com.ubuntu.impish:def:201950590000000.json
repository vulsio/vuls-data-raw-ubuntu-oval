		"description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-5059` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibsdl2-image-2.0-0 - 2.0.5+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
