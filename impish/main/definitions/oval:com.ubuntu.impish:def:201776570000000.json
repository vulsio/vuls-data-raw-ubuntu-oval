		"Title": "CVE-2017-7657 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
		"Description": "In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7657` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njetty9 - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-extra-java - 9.2.26-1\nlibjetty9-java - 9.2.26-1\nNo subscription required",
