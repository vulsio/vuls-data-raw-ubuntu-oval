		"description": "USN-5313-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added features in OpenJDK. Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression in OpenJDK 11 that could impact interoperability with some popular HTTP/2 servers making it unable to connect to said servers. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled deserialization filters.  An attacker could possibly use this issue to insert, delete or obtain  sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21248)   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly read uncompressed TIFF files.  An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service via  a specially crafted TIFF file. (CVE-2022-21277)   Jonni Passki discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly verified access  restrictions when performing URI resolution. An attacker could possibly  use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21282)   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain regular  expressions in the Pattern class implementation. An attacker could  possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21283)   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled specially crafted Java  class files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial  of service. (CVE-2022-21291)   Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated attributes  during object deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21293, CVE-2022-21294)   Dan Rabe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly verified access permissions  in the JAXP component. An attacker could possibly use this to specially  craft an XML file to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21296)   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled XML entities. An  attacker could use this to specially craft an XML file that, when parsed,  would possibly cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21299)   Zhiqiang Zang discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled array indexes.  An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.  (CVE-2022-21305)   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly read very long attributes  values in JAR file manifests. An attacker could possibly use this to  specially craft JAR file to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21340)   It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated input from serialized  streams. An attacker cold possibly use this issue to bypass sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2022-21341)   Fabian Meumertzheim discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain  specially crafted BMP or TIFF files. An attacker could possibly use this  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21360, CVE-2022-21366)   It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in OpenJDK  BMPImageReader class implementation. An attacker could possibly use this  to specially craft a BMP file to cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2022-21365)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo ua fix USN-5313-2` to fix the vulnerability.
