		"description": "It was discovered that NTFS-3G incorrectly handled the ntfsck tool. If a user or automated system were tricked into using ntfsck on a specially crafted disk image, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-46790)  Roman Fiedler discovered that NTFS-3G incorrectly handled certain return codes. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to intercept protocol traffic between FUSE and the kernel. (CVE-2022-30783)  It was discovered that NTFS-3G incorrectly handled certain NTFS disk images. If a user or automated system were tricked into mounting a specially crafted disk image, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-30784, CVE-2022-30786, CVE-2022-30788, CVE-2022-30789)  Roman Fiedler discovered that NTFS-3G incorrectly handled certain file handles. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to read and write arbitrary memory. (CVE-2022-30785, CVE-2022-30787)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo ua fix USN-5463-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ntfs-3g - 1:2017.3.23AR.3-3ubuntu5.1 libntfs-3g883 - 1:2017.3.23AR.3-3ubuntu5.1 ntfs-3g-dev - 1:2017.3.23AR.3-3ubuntu5.1 No subscription required",
