		"title": "5142-3 -- Samba regression",
		"description": "USN-5142-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Samba. Some of the upstream changes introduced a regression in Kerberos authentication in certain environments.  Please see the following upstream bug for more information: https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14922  This update fixes the problem.  Original advisory details:   Stefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba incorrectly handled SMB1 client  connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade  connections to plaintext authentication. (CVE-2016-2124)    Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly mapping domain users to  local users. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to  become root on domain members. (CVE-2020-25717)    Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba did not correctly sandbox Kerberos  tickets issues by an RODC. An RODC could print administrator tickets,  contrary to expectations. (CVE-2020-25718)    Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly handled Kerberos tickets.  Delegated administrators could possibly use this issue to impersonate  accounts, leading to total domain compromise. (CVE-2020-25719)    Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba did not provide stable AD  identifiers to Kerberos acceptors. (CVE-2020-25721)    Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba did not properly check sensitive  attributes. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to  escalate privileges. (CVE-2020-25722)    Stefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain large  DCE/RPC requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to  bypass signature requirements. (CVE-2021-23192)    William Ross discovered that Samba incorrectly handled memory. A remote  attacker could use this issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a  denial of service, or possibly escalate privileges. (CVE-2021-3738)    Joseph Sutton discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain TGS  requests. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause  Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3671)    The fix for CVE-2020-25717 results in possible behaviour changes that could  affect certain environments.
