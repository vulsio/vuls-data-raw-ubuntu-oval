		"description": "Elison Niven discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the c_rehash script. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary commands when c_rehash is run. (CVE-2022-1292)  Raul Metsma discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly verified certain response signing certificates. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof certain response signing certificates. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1343)  Tom Colley discovered that OpenSSL used the incorrect MAC key in the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. In non-default configurations were RC4-MD5 is enabled, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to modify encrypted communications. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1434)  Aliaksei Levin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled resources when decoding certificates and keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1473)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo ua fix USN-5402-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  libssl1.1 - 1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.3 libssl-dev - 1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.3 openssl - 1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.3 libssl-doc - 1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.3 No subscription required",
