		"description": "It was discovered that SPIP incorrectly validated inputs. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-28984)  Charles Fol and Th√©o Gordyjan discovered that SPIP is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS). If a user were tricked into browsing a malicious SVG file, an attacker could possibly exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-44118, CVE-2021-44120, CVE-2021-44122, CVE-2021-44123)  It was discovered that SPIP incorrectly handled certain forms. A remote authenticated editor could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code, and a remote unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-26846, CVE-2022-26847)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo ua fix USN-5482-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  spip - 3.2.11-3+deb11u3build0.21.10.1 No subscription required",
