		"description": "James Troup discovered that snap did not properly manage the permissions for the snap directories. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3155)  Ian Johnson discovered that snapd did not properly validate content interfaces and layout paths. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to inject arbitrary AppArmor policy rules, resulting in a bypass of intended access restrictions. (CVE-2021-4120)  The Qualys Research Team discovered that snapd did not properly validate the location of the snap-confine binary. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute other arbitrary binaries and escalate privileges. (CVE-2021-44730)  The Qualys Research Team discovered that a race condition existed in the snapd snap-confine binary when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-44731)  Update Instructions:  Run `sudo ua fix USN-5292-1` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:  ubuntu-core-snapd-units - 2.54.3+21.10.1 ubuntu-core-launcher - 2.54.3+21.10.1 snap-confine - 2.54.3+21.10.1 ubuntu-snappy-cli - 2.54.3+21.10.1 golang-github-snapcore-snapd-dev - 2.54.3+21.10.1 snapd-xdg-open - 2.54.3+21.10.1 snapd - 2.54.3+21.10.1 golang-github-ubuntu-core-snappy-dev - 2.54.3+21.10.1 ubuntu-snappy - 2.54.3+21.10.1 No subscription required",
